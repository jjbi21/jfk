There comes a point where you're too old for the whole I'm so goofy and fun every second of every day schtick. Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged, white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job. Or you can't hair flip your way out of an inevitable date rape charge. /v yu are the best /v Well done I LOVE! You so much :D /v I am very happy for this man and we need to spread more love.

Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist. /v Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you /v You're telling me that you're not perfect and sometimes you fuck up? \nThat's wired.. /v Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man /v Never apologise to the regressives /v dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah /v Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration /v PROCEED WITH CAUTION: \nThis comment section will give you stage 4 cancer immediately. /v this isn't a bad thing... shit happens /v I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people .\n IF  YOU'RE  WHITE  DONT  TELL  POC  HOW  THEY  SHOULD  FEEL . Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled. /v And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful. /v What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you /v OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist. /v pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play. /v I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well /v Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller /v Y'all will forgive him for anything lol /v i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it.. /v I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds! /v HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES\n\nIF YOU HAVENT MADE THEM, YOU ARENT HUMAN. /v i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word. /v I don't see it as racist, but rather as an accident /v I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads /v People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it /v Its just a word, calm down /v lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front /v To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD /v So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans. /v  watch by clicking here people's are entertaining /v Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened. /v What did he say?? /v Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/ /v If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period /v I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill. /v Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me /v Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao /v I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves /v Social justice warriors need to chill /v As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation) /v Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down  btw I do like idubbz it was just an example /v say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much /v Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix /v If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video. /v Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke. /v It's okay man /v Weird, my thumbs up doesn't stay. Could it be corrupted YouTube again? /v The day nobody cares about the word is the day it loses its power over people. Don't try to tell me that I'm only saying this because I don't UNDERSTAND. I DO. People have been slaughtered before, Countries have been Defiled AND ENSLAVED.. USED AS PROSTITUTES. NOT ONLY YOU... WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THIS N WORD STILL ENSLAVE YOU? /v Who gives a Shit . /v THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANES AND YET Y'ALLZ ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOME CRACKA WITH A POTTY MOUTH???\n\nSincerely, your friendly neighborhood Beaner. /v honestly I don't care I won't let the word overpower me, I always will care about you pewdie! /v say the word cracker.. journos wont care because theres a huge double standard and they hate white people! /v This guy's face screams 'I'm gonna kill myself'. He seems to have lost all zest for life. /v Blacks folks say that shit with every sentence and when whitey says it on accident without disrespectful thoughts the whole world turns. /v It's ok Felix. /v I think it is okay, you are sorry about that and it is done. Strange is, that we have here 2 kind of people. 1 which can say this word with N and nothing happen und the other people where everybody get insane. Just think of it. /v Power is the disease. Care is the cure. Keep caring for yourself and others as best as you can. This is life. /v 20 likes and Ill eat a pickle /v How many sorrys can one say and still be able to be a part of YouTube /v Real life racism in the world<Guy says dum shit on a video game.. /v People in the coments you are stupid hes an adult its not a mastake he should know not to say it stop defending him all the time /v Y'all are stupid /v I bet you only 10% of the people getting triggered by him saying the n word are actually black. /v Hey Felix who care? The context is what matters. We know you are not a racist. Don't feed into these stupid narratives. /v Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah! /v Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf /v I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell. /v Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it. /v You are basically the face of YouTube. For someone who has woken up from a coma since before YouTube was around you'd be the first thing they'd know about YouTube. I know you have all this pressure under your shoulders because if you say anything wrong, it would be like the YouTube logo walked on stage and said: Fuck off! \n\nIt's hard to control how you are and speak, I know it, and I feel bad for you. You didn't have to apologize, as you said nigger to a yellow fucking blob, but you did. /v All these people that are saying you should say what ever you want are also trump supporters. /v Pewd you don't have anything to apologize for... it's just a word /v Thank you for apologizing pewds, i haven't lost respect for you /v Sh*t happens carry on /v Dude it's just a word. Maybe ppl shouldn't be getting so butt hurt to be honest. /v It's not like he said Voldemort. Ain't no evil wizards gonna come out if you say the n word /v lol its just a word /v If a black american says the n word it's called slang. If a black american can call us white people or typical white girls it's called fun. But if a white person says the n word he's a racist. K den /v People give power to the word they don't want to hear. If someone says the N word, let it slide. Because you're the one who's making it a bigger deal. Stop caring and things will cool off /v Everyone makes mistakes. /v Nice kaws statues dude /v Fuck niggers. /v https://youtu.be/XBJtNAhVLag /v Food for thought everybody:

They should've just copied the infinity display too...would've made it look much nicer. /v This phone reminded me of the iphone 3gs, so glad that i got my S8+ for $775 /v techrax is gonna be so happy  /v What if its night? Face recognition huh? /v The copy of the Samsung 8 /v how do you go from 8 to 10 /v Stealing not having a home button just like the Samsung galaxy s8 /v That's the 8 the iPhone x is different /v To me, it's just a waste of money. Samsung galaxy note 8 is better /v If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly. Poor iPhone 9 and 7 doesn't get an s model. Next year, remove the numerics and refer to it only as iPhone the same way the numerics no longer exist for iPads or a MacBook. /v If you look at the top you can see the camera they're using to film the iPhone is seeing the IR blasts coming from the sensor. /v No home button? *laughs in Android* /v just wait ... I'll sell my kidney n bay it . /v #Apple have released another #Chinese clone it seems. Taking the last 3 years #tech already seen and throwing it into a device twice the price. I haven't seen any #groundbreaking moves from #Apple for many years now, even the computers are being #owned by competitors. /v xbox one x most powerfull console + iphone x= love /v The back is ugly /v Someone help me buy this phone. ... anyone?  Come on millionaires & billionaires can anyone help me /v It looks like a Samsung /v 5.8 inches X is larger the iPhone 8 is 5.5 inches ! The 8 has the button /v I Done! I'm going back to flip phones! Where can I buy a Motorola RAZR? /v Face recognition is the most stupid thing ever imo. I can get into my S5 just as fast, and with way more simplicity with my pattern lock. And is it just me or does that look like a past display screen, it's the complete opposite of an infinity screen and looks ugly. /v apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit, the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins.... /v You guys are Giving more reasons to swich back to iphone. /v The phone looks cool on the front but the back and sides look awful, especially with that glass back and how the camera lip is like the Iphone 6 (Not smooth) and not like the Iphone 7 (smooth). /v Android has done this already not original /v Now without a charging port, you're still gonna buy it tho /v If I could only afford one... /v It looks like glass iPhone,,, that effect is not for me,,,  death /v Made in China for $1000 +? LOL,  I can only imagine if it was made in the U.S. Talk about high profit margin. Apple is such a SCAM! \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/apple-earnings-q2-2017-how-much-cash-does-apple-have.html /v *Has features flagship Android phones have had for YEARS such as wireless charging, face unlock, etc. \n\n*Still, hilariously, convinces people that it's revolutionary and is worth over a $1,000\n\nApple - you are brilliant lol /v I wanted a better phone, if I wanted a camera I would have bought a Nikon. /v They should have put the fingerprint scanner on the apple logo on the back of the phone. /v Im gonna buy it just because im gonna get better snap chat filters smh  /v Didn't the 7 just come out... /v wow tf copy samsung much  /v Absolutely beautiful but wtf apple?! 1000 dollars???

Nevermind that would be an insult to samsung and there amazing design team. Android has had these features for years, nothing new.

With lower resolution, a notch that blocks your view, and no hard press home button. /v You know  you'll buy it. We'll all buy it. Damn you Apple! But seriously why buy an iPhone 8 when it's almost exactly like an iPhone 7 but slight with 2 more nucleus. Save money for iPhone X or better yet , save your money and in 2 more years the price will drop enough to buy it, after the new iPhone XI, XII, XII, XX come out. /v Do you know what really grinds my gears? The iPhone X in America costs $999, which should be about 760, but they still charge 999. /v Ever since Steve jobs passed away Iphone has gone to shit.  Iphones use to be sooo good. Like seriously wireless charging now? Samsung implemented it 2 generation ago with the S6 lmao xD /v u should get rid the parody /v man i wants this phone so bad but i can't afford it  /v my local radio station played an audio clip from your video /v I told Nintendo that Switch wouldnt be a success before it went on sale because I thought that in the age of the smartphone no one would carry around a game console,\n -Tsunekazu Ishihara /v they made it so easy for you hahaha emoji machine /v Where was the parody? /v the dementor part was so funny, me me proud boy jack /v Ohohoho he said it *laughing like a walrus*  /v I just got a redbull ad of 2 iphones being abandoned by their owners.\n\n\n\n\nI have a feeling they're gonna have some company soon. /v Hi !

Also, anyone know the song name? /v At first I didn't like it but that voice grew on me /v The greatest movie about the greatest movie. /v A24 doesn't disappoint.All there movie I seen was good /v James Franco could earn an Oscar nomination for this ! /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Did he go full retard or half retard?

Definitely see Oscar nominations coming. /v I think I prefer the Room itself /v the book was a true literary masterpiece. just like the movie The Room /v name of song is ACE MARINO - COMMUNICATION /v Damn he's so accurate /v After seeing the teaser, I was a little concerned about James Franco's accent, but not anymore! That was SPOT ON. This looks fantastic (and not just because of the accent). I cannot wait to see this! /v This is a great fake trailer!! /v His performance looks so much better than in the teaser. /v You'll never be famous in a million years!\n\nBut after that?

It seems like a modern Ed Wood. /v It did not take a bunch of tries for Tommy to get his lines right. This movie is already gonna he inaccurate and terrible. /v Looks like they made a terrible movie about making a terrible movie.  Exactly what the world needs right now! /v *Cant wait for the movie to come out....anyway how's your sex life?* /v WATCH IT IF YOU LOVE WATCHING FILMS ::  https://youtu.be/zMgekuJ8rx4 /v Hi, if your reading this, I just want you to have a good day.

Google keyword search: images: universe + neuron /v where the hell is this clown coming from? never heard such non-sense. /v I can't believe he was a doctor /v What do you think he took away from today?\nMy luggage...\nSo, trump is a liar AND a thief! /v You poor hippocrats..Still crying and looking for attention. /v Europe is laughing out loud at you americans, simply because you elected a bunch of apes to run your country. /v I hope the media stays on top of Carson's HUD, any other federal agencies where woefully unqualified cronies have been installed. Their incompetence and results need to be reported so we can see what happens when people think government and experience in government doesn't matter. /v I can sympathize with Ben Carson for being a scatterbrain, but not for his agenda. /v Tbf leadership skills can be transferable buuuuuuuut sometimes those leaders lack said leadership skills... /v The lunatic surrounds himself with other lunatics. America, you have become so bizarre... /v Do you think Dolan gave Ben Carson the job only because he heard Urban in the name? /v Ben Carson's stupidity still hasn't failed to shock me. /v BEN CARSON IS THE MAN!!!!! THEY HATE HIM CAUSE HE EXPOSED HITLARY'S RITUAL ABUSE ON CHILDREN!!!!!!! /v Seriously? You decide to attack the most prominent black republican representative? When we have all these other huge issues in our current government. Wow. I always knew Seth was Racist. He's just open about it now I guess. /v How did them 6 others survive being stuck in a lift with him without him killing them with boredom, lucky it wasn't just one that would be a death sentence for sure. /v So Americans in states that elected Drumpf will need the very 2 agencies - HUD And EPA - that the Drumpf administration vitually dismantled? HAH! Talk about what goes around comes around... /v Conservative republicans don't need any of that socialist government aide! They have bootstraps that they pull up to get them out of the muck and when the rich people start trickling their wealth down, all will be right again! /v Ben Carson could screw up a one car funeral /v What an absolute clown.  It's reflective of the state of our nation that a man like Ben Carson could somehow manage to become a leading candidate for president of the United States.\n\nKudos to Ben Carson for his success as a brain surgeon, but it's fair to remember that politics isn't brain surgery - it's far more difficult. /v DON'T TAKE ME TO A BLACK DOCTOR /v Ben Carson doesn't believe in the policies of HUD *Continue to show commentators criticizing him but don't give any policy arguments or even show Dr. Carson explaining what he believes* /v Seth forgot to add the rampant nepotism at HUD, with Carson's wife and kids attending meetings and making decisions. /v I have to plug in headphones just to hear your weasel ass /v What kind of loser uses a massave natural disaster to take political and personal stabs at anyone for the sake of ratings and profit? Oh yea its seth myers. What a POS. /v Seth Meyers, Just another Shekelgruber RKM agent spewing his RKM lies to America. Want to learn more about this Shekelgruber agent and the RKM?  Click the link below:\n                            http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/03/08/the-hidden-history-of-the-incredibly-evil-khazarian-mafia/ /v A lot of sleight of hand and smoke screening going on in this video...sure hope folks understand the HUD budget cuts and relief aid allowances better than Seth does before they go running around spreading this bs to others. /v What has Obama done before he was president? What experience did he have? /v Sad part he's not the only one not qualified for his post. We have a guy who sued EPA a number of times as the EPA chief. Devos as Education Chief, Rick Perry as Energy secretary, and a racist midget is the AG. /v After seen this clip I'm flabbergasted, in my stupidity I'd thought that in the presidential cabinet it had only one crazy person but I see that they have a collection of them. /v The pseudo leader of the Wu-tang Clan is the RZA. /v Understand: To some, Trump is the fulfillment of their religious aspirations. Good luck, reality. /v Ben Carson - someone dumber and stranger than Donald - hard to believe /v Ben carson on paper looked like a put together fella. Then he started talking on tv. Now we all know there is something terribly wrong with HIS BRAIN. /v Carson, Pruit, Devos and Price were deliberate selections by Trump and Bannon to destabilize the US government. Good job. Gobshites! /v It's harder to become the best nurosurgen than to become part of the public housing /v Trump literally didn't know who Fredrick Douglas was.  He just recently discovered Lincoln was a Republican (before Republicans switched to being the racist party during the Civil Rights era).  He thought health care was five dollar a month life insurance. He doesn't know how to spell heal.  He's STOOOOOPPID. /v I hope Louis Black is watching this. /v Dude is like a Republican Rain Man. /v i will not intentionally do anything to benefit...any...american! only russians! /v I was laughing until Seth said the guy is basically dismantling the department. This nation is perfectly capable of building affordable housing for less fortunate, but hey, who cares about them, the money is in multi-million dollar condos. /v What's with the telemundo mug? /v Ben Carson is proof that a person can be a neurosurgeon and somehow still be stupid as hell. /v I have a question. Where's the... luggage! Someone took his luggage :(. Ahhhhhhh /v It's not the responsibility of the federal government to pay for people's homes when they are destroyed. /v I don't know wether to laugh or cry anymore when I see these clips... /v Paul Ryan has not yet come to terms with the fact that Ayn Rand is power pornography for teenage boys at a certain stage of aching virginity -- and normal kids get over it.\n \nA lot of people throughout RepublicanLand have variations on the same problem.  They really believe a scientifically incorrect notion, that human beings are independent of one another.  It may feel like that for the lonely teenager, but it's never, ever, true.  \n \nFrom that falsehood, they then build up moralities, generally ugly, histories, false, and a subset of both: self-serving aims or purpose.\n\nThis high-minded purpose gives us a HUD Secretary who is opposed to the Department of HUD, a Secretary of Health (named Price!) who believes that all medicine should be commercial.  You've got a guy over at Environmental Protection who is on the side of the folks continuing to dig the hole deeper.  All with the highest moralities he's been able to find anywhere! \n \nThe good Doctor Carson is really, really, one of the gang.\n\n-dlj. /v It is Trump's goal to dismantle the US government and leave it in so much chaos that Russia is able to become the largest super power again. /v You all recall when a man threw his shoe at former pres.Bush? Well, it's time to get your shoes ready again people!!! /v wake up Ben you are talking on stage! /v how high is that guy /v God damn bumbling fool. They must have experimented on his brain /v Ben Carson is clearly writing his own prescriptions /v * points and laughs at Ben Carson * /v I loved the CPR joke. A lot. /v 2:34 Watching that guy in the background as his eyes bounce back and forth rapidfire between Warren and Carson.\n\n5:55 Seriously, he probably fell asleep /v I worked at a top NYC hospital and the neurosurgeons were loons. /v And so far he has succeeded /v 07:32  Make the USA  Great again   <<<== TAKE A $6.2 Billion cut from HUD 2018 Budget just so  that the WEALTHY pay even LESS in TAXES.. Still support DUMP Mr.& Misses Trailer park dwellers who SUPPORTED THIS CLOWN.. NOT THAT HIL HIL Was ANY BETTER.. I VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS..    Bernie+Lizzie&Birdie 2020 /v Ben Carson is a idiot. But what else is to expect from a American? /v Lmao this man is a walking punch line! /v Does he only operate on foreign children, or is he just taking a break from helping? I guess we shouldn't get on Carson too much for his worst answer to a marathon Q&A, but jeez this guy. /v Hold up... The Abbot is Wu leader... GFK is a king, no doubt, but... Rza tho /v Well The brain surgeon Ben Carson just proved how truly insane he is /v Trump eliminated the programs we needed the most. Not wise. /v Glad I never had him for a doctor /v I wish Ben Carson was my grandpa... /v Please go bck to surgery. No freaking experience in this position. That's new normal in administration .  Imagine him performing brain surgery without any training. A disaster!! The most powerful position in world also has no experience but you need experience to get almost  any other job.  Sick /v Well the people of Texas probably shouldn't have voted for the person bragging about slashing relief funds huh. Hindsight really is 20/20 /v What did he take away from this [trip] today?\nMy luggage!\n\n... but maybe that only adds an extra layer of humour if english is not your mother tongue? ;) /v Trump sees HUD primarily as a tool for enriching well-connected real-estate developers, Carsons combination of loyalty and ignorance may make him uniquely qualified for the position.  /v And this guy is a brain surgeon; wonder how many lawsuits against him?  He's despicable! /v Rural Americans black people only voted for Obama because he's blackBen Carson runs for president Black people: NO!Rural Americans: but we thought....... /v  OMG this dump administration is a nightmare LMAO /v *THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA* /v inept is putting it mildly /v check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9gngMJvMYk /v I forgot Ben Carson existed /v I like Ben Carson /v dr. ben magoo /v Oh look another comedian reporter crying. /v f....cking lefties always talking sh...... /v Ugh... 6:30...I'm done LOL /v 2:36 2:55 Lol /v Such a fool.  /v http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=64120 /v Tha fuq? /v sow what you reap /v We are so screwed /v I think Ben Carson needs neurosurgery. /v Ridiculous fake news /v This dude is weird asf /v Ben Carson!!!!!!\nGood God!! /v As an Australian living in Melbourne I have never been so thankful to have the massive Pacific Ocean, several time zones & the equator between me & the U.S. I pity anyone who will get trapped under Trumps stupid, bumbling, demagoguery #Glade_To_NOT_Be_An_American. /v Just here for the thumbs down! **liberal propaganda** /v Lets see. A white privileged, white racist Hollywood comedian who's made his career focus on bashing America and its people who live not according to his lifestyle, thinks he's doing the white race a solid by attack an intelligent, accomplished Black Man who is one of the world best known neurosurgeon. This comedian is a racist asshole. /v The head of HUD is a dud , /v Will Texans refuse to take government handouts?? And be proud republicans?? /v How could Ben Carson cou#$ dfj$% .......  /v Merica is seriously in chaos /v Sounds like the phone will be easier to booty dial. Just saying! /v My two biggest disappointments from this event are 1 the iPhone 10 not having a full 2k display and the screen only putting out 625nits of max brightness. That's a little less than half the max brightness of the galaxy note 8. I understand it will be better than the Note 8 in lots of other ways, but I wanted it to match or be better in every conceivable way so the android fans wouldn't have anything to hold on to. /v Facial recognition! No way! Oh wait my damn Nexus 4 had that shit. God apple is so pathetic these days /v So...we're just going to overlook how advanced technology is becoming to describe you? LOCATION, FINGER PRINTS, FRONT FACING APPLE ID UNLOCK......l'll pass. /v Wireless charging, which is awesome to see. It doesn't even feel awesome anymore. It's old news, has been used by companies for 3 years. /v Am I the only person who finds the shape of the screen unappealing? It looks like the screen has ears. /v My first question is: Where do other notification icons go? /v  watch by clicking here you can see People's are entertaining /v stupid face id. so what is you are a twin. should have stuck with touch id for security /v Look at all these poor Shitsung folks in the comments...Putting personal preference aside, no matter how you slice it, Apple will come out with the new best-selling phone on the market, again. It will be the fastest phone on the market, again. It will have the most used features, largest and most well-developed App Store, and highest adoption rate of hardware & software out of every single phone on the planet. People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years. In the end, none of the debate matters when it's Tim Cook who will be sitting on top of his massive cash pile with the first TRILLION DOLLAR-VALUED company in the world. Can't argue with facts people. BUT, I'm sure you'll find a way! /v How do you put it in sleep mode if holding off makes Siri alert? /v Here's a question: if you trigger Siri by holding down the Sleep/Wake button, how do you turn off the phone? /v Junk, made in China for 5$ /v And no 128gb. 64gb and then 256. Ridiculous. Anyway... not upgrading. /v The battery icon already changes from white to black . It's stock iOS . Tell me something new . /v Apple is really starting to fall off. Galaxy S8 is tops right now next to the Galaxy Note 8. /v Like this or you'll become gay /v ...From a emoji *uses the poop emoji* this is the best shit from the new iPhone though.\ndude... /v brb* going to whore myself for this phone /v I think people won't complain about the headphone jack if Apple Ships their iPhones with wireless earbuds. /v What if u just show a picture of the iPhone owner's face to unlock the phone lolol /v I liked the what does the fox say joke /v There is no 9, because 7 ate 9! Okay I'll go now.... /v how can you take a screenshot ?? /v That gesture reminds me of the BlackBerry 10 OS /v Specs are fine but imo..... Hate the design for the hell of everything! /v $1000 for a phone?!?! WTF. then iPhone XI will come out in six months but this time it will be larger. geez /v Talking shit emoji! That is classic! Thank you Apple engineers for making it real /v Why can't anyone build a phone without camera bumps? /v No reason to buy it /v iPhone 10. If you're going to use numerals for your prior devices numerals it is. Now if they had revealed the iPhone VIII and iPhone VIII+, then I would use X as in x-ray. Either way, I won't be going to a phone that only allows facials for biometrics. /v This looks cool enough, but i prefer the older style of iphones more, so i'll probably stick to iphone 8 /v Does it come up with preloaded 4k porn?? /v Gonna buy the iphone X *ASAP* ! It got animated emojis guys like wtf you want more ? /v Did the idea of having a  microsd never crossed apples mind??!? And why isn't there a headphones jack !!!!face Id is nice but why remove the touch Id!???? /v I don't get it. Since it has 3D Touch, why didn't Apple incorporate a hard press at the bottom of the screen to go home? Swipe seems less intuitive. /v Why dont TMobile sell google phones? Ive seen them get the best ratings for cameras etc but why arent they more mainstream? /v as a left handed iPhone user, Im wondering, if you can go to the Control Center by swiping from the left top corner, too? :/ /v *I think the iPhoneX is beautiful, can't wait to get my hands on one. Also interested to see what case companies do for iPhoneX phone cases. * /v Literally looks like a bad version of the s8 mixed in with some bad Chinese Android knockoffs. /v New phones rolling out every year with minor design changes to keep hype going and getting more expensive. Over-marketing strategy. /v How will face id help chinese unlock the fone, they all look the same /v This is a really nice phone but the price makes it hard to justify against something like the Galaxy S8 or Essential phone /v If you drop these phones, you're lucky if both glass panels don't shatter simultaneously...screen and back. But iPhone buyers have enough money anyway...so it hits no beggars. lol /v Hmm can't say I'm too into the look of this phone... I think I'm gonna go with the LG V30 this year. /v hahhaha you fool...ass hole ...there is nothing new /v Eehhhhhhh, its a disappointment. The s8 and note 8 are miles ahead. /v Is it just me or does the iPhone X frame look chunkier compared to the S8+? /v Beautiful design but if I'm going for anything, it will be keeping my 6s and getting the Apple Watch with cellular /v People complaining about the notch are imbeciles. How else were they supposed to go full screen and still fit the speaker grille, sensors & front camera in there? iPhone X is gorgeous, imo. /v they took gesture tech from blackberry 10 phones. BB was really good. Missing it. /v Really ? You don't have any complaints right off the bat? That's kinda sad, I saw you as a reliable source of information. /v I will not be wearing a case with iPhone X /v I was really curious about that iPhone 9 thing too. Apparently it's the iPhone X because it's the ten year anniversary /v Hats off for the owners of Apple for all the money they are going to make with their new overpriced gadgets. /v *Does anyone thinks this is a complete waste of money?* /v There are some A holes that judging something they cant afford stupid kids down there /v samsung alredy have all these new features /v Intro sounds like it belongs in Splatoon. :P /v Dumbest phone, just buy the any iphone since the 6. They are all basically the same thing. /v When are they gonna be on sell ?? /v Do they have to pay some sort of fee to touch and use the phones?? /v I have Apple products but I cant justify paying $1,000 for this phone. Seems like they need to bring in people who are more inventive. /v My galaxy S8 is still better. Switching to android from Apple has been my best decision this year. /v Dont you dare call it iphone x, accidentally says iphone x  /v It's cool but not a 1000 bucks cool /v How do you turn the phone off if holding down the button activates Siri? /v Does this thing know how to suck a dick? /v EVERYONE holds their phone by the sides....WHY THE FUCK is the power button on the side instead of the top to prevent accidental pressing and having to unlock the phone AGAIN!?!?!?!   (super major gripe with every phone out there....designers are morons) /v I worry about certain games that require you to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to play and that might constantly trigger the back to home screen function. /v yay i can afford a 4s now /v the iPhone 8... skips to 10...\nWindows 8... also skips to 10...\n;) /v Hell man I'm tripping on a 1000 bucks really /v I prefer iPhone 8 over 10, cause iPhone 10 looks like one of those android phones with a similar design. iPhone 8 looks more of a iPhone instead of 10. /v How do you power it off if the power button is now a Siri button? /v Finally i will be able to buy iPhone SE /v Everyone just getting all their new Apple stuff while i still cant afford the actual fruit smh -_- /v If you forget the gimmicky bezeless front, the iPhone X is lowkey trash /v its my birthday today /v Dude! /v iPhone 10... of COURSE... /v lmao gay af. /v 1000 lol /v Nice! /v How would you screenshot? /v Yay! Another stupidly overpriced iPhone! /v little disappointed... /v copying samsung /v S8+ > iPhone x /v Close to 5M subs hype /v That notch looks horribly ugly, and those gestures will go sooo wrong... /v iPhone Xpensive /v Lol  /v Remember Palm Pre yeahhh. /v  /v How you screenshot then /v AMAZING! /v lol my nvidia shield can handle HDR & 4k since years /v Great review! /v Looks fucking beautiful. /v Thanks for watching today :) This had my heart pounding.

Henry Jekyll! I quit. Screw this movie, the Dank Universe, the acting careers it ruined, and ESPECIALLY screw whatever they were planning on doing with Dracula. \n\n\n\nUnless Dracula Untold was supposed to be in this universe. Screw that movie, too. /v What I find odd is that they chose to use a clip from RKO's Hunchback of Notre Dame to represent the UNIVERSAL Monsters. /v Play say WORLD WAR TWO...\nGERMANY IS BACK...\nAND THIS TIME ITS PERSONAL /v Correction * tom cruise runs from sand AGAIN /v look Screen junkie , I love honest trailer,and I will continue loving it. but recent videos miss something that was done so well in the past:the pauses .

Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates. /v Collegehumor remembered their name and made a video about college humor...? It's been too long. /v Honestly I'm three weeks into college and i want to kill myself. /v So you don't have the one kid who is terrified of the  prospect of his impending future and how much his decisions actually mean despite having 18 years of where he was basically along for the ride and constantly thinks about putting a barrel to their head? /v im watching this at college /v I got accepted into hardboard with an IQ of 43 at the age of 45 /v That last bit with the questions is literally me every time I am in class... /v What about the construction of buildings that actually sound cool, but will never be completed until after you finish college. /v The loud, yelly dude in the blue shirt... so spot on. Every day, I just want to kick all of those guys right in the nuts... /v she was so cute omg throw this in the garbage xD  /v Forgot to mention the blue lighting system /v I'm so glad I'm an old fart who never has to go to school again. Woo Hoo! /v At last some actual College Humor. /v Yo this was funny af /v Holy shit, a college joke on college humor. It's been a while. /v The Amazon prime student membership is just gold /v I went to Boston University.  When I would have my spring break, I would pretend to be a Harvard student and go to their classes.  Harvard was fun.  Their lectures were more interesting than ours, which was totally unfair.  I even gave someone else directions one time.  MIT was depressing/suffocating though.  It was a combination of the people and atmosphere.  I only pretended to go there for half a day. /v Is it just me or is Rekha really cute? /v That was an ad /v But for real, why is it that all the science buildings are hideous? /v You forgot to mention that college is a complete waste of time and money for a lot of people. /v Thank you from tour guides everywhere.

BLACK guy  with beber ...... what a joke..... the kept their doors closed  during harvy ....... /v Attention celebrity assholes. What's your carbon footprint? Did you match Donald trump's million dollar donation? Do you know the term hypocrite? /v Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others dont? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities? /v Israel....Separate yourselves away from the Wicked..,from the ways of the Nations that have swallowed you up...or share in reaping what they have sown....\n\nProverbs 11:21\nTHOUGH HAND JOIN IN HAND  , the WICKED shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.\n\nJeremiah 23:19\n9Behold, A WHIRLWIND OF THE LORD IS GONE FORTH IN FURY, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. \n\n20The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: IN THE LATTER DAYS YE SHALL CONSIDER IT PERFECTLY. /v MTV trump donating to charity is racist\nTherefore mtv is now promoting nazis\nYour welcome /v prayers for all !!! Music  will never die ,we all need to let it touch our souls!! /v Why are people like Rich people asking the poor for money. Youre basically saying, Lets not help other human beings in need because the rich should be able to take care of it themselves. News flash, they are donating their money, but you are NOT entitled to THEIR money! Just like you work hard for yours, they worked hard for theirs. Just giving yourselves reasons to be stingy and lazy. /v Was SJW Francesspool there to explain to us how the hurricane was racist and it's white people's fault? /v Maybe the Rothschild and Rockefeller can donate a few trillion dollars /v Where's beyonce oh .... just that ?!?! 12:29 hey Queen /v Logo looks like the SED emblem from communist germany... /v And the Fallen Angels come to the rescue really? Neither man nor woman folks just like pan just like Baphomet. You don't believe me but I'll show you the veil has been lifted and you need to see they're only here to make an appearance and to act in entertain. Don't you know that's how they hit out all these years? The running all the countries and you know Hollywood goes hand-in-hand with Washington DC that is. Mr. E can show you. I suggest you watch well listen to James first begood4000 video with an old woman on front 9/12 date please. Yes men & men. Oh Satan the sly dog. Not one woman in Hollywood. Well considering the five who created it I understand why. Egyptians Romans Greek false Jews. Time to spread the news. He lives stop worshipping false idols. Praying to dead Saints. Again he lives. God bless /v rich millionaires asking the poor for money wow please die in a hole you scum /v This is sick!!! Wish these celebrities would just go away!!! They are nothing but wolves in sheep's clothing! Don't give! They just wanna look good! Don't be deceived! Ugh! /v Hillary Clinton won almost all the counties destroyed by Harvey and Irma.  Is she throwing cash at her voters? /v most of these rancid celebs ARE PAID to show up... dont support them, and  donate to better charities /v @28:55 the epitome of decadence and creepiness. These people are out of touch creepozoids! Just look into their eyes.... they do not give a shit... they would kill you and eat you for dinner just to be trendy in a second. They disgust me... anything they do disgusts me. Using this tragedy orchestrated and allowed by the government in order to punish Trump and spew race based GARBAGE and get off on themselves as if they are actually DOING someting>>>> they make me want to VOMIT RIGHT IN THEIR FACES! They are not taking calls on those phones... its all fake its all phony! We are on to your sick mind games. /v All the celebrities should join together and help the hurricane tragic damages. The people have supported and help them become famous they need to put their money where their mouth is. The people don't want to see or hear stupid ass shows. This show probably took a lot of money to set up the funds should go to Houston. /v Most of the deviation videos were places in Dickinson, yet they said it was all Houston. we need help in Dickinson come on guys! /v Wow thats cool they invited big girl with a powerfull voice. Hope all the people get there money /v Colbert? Really? I wonder how many people said FU and changed the channel as soon as they saw that asshole. /v I wonder what the administrative overhead is for this organization? I would rather see these celebs roll up their sleeves and do some actual work.. You would be better off donating to Mercury one 100% of your donation goes to the cause at hand. /v Do not ever give money to events like this!! Very little money if any goes to the victims /v If celebrities, business owners and VIPs involved donated $100k each you would reach the goal hours ago.  Donald Trump donated $1 Million, the Kardashian Family 500k.  Also I really really really hope the money goes to the victims not an organization or government. /v This is exactly what the US deserves after a decade of imperialism and war-mongering. Die! /v If you live in a hurricane zone and don't have insurance.......you're a fucking retard.   Do you expect the rest of the country to bail you out ever 3-5 years?   Florida Hurricane Welfare System /v these are filthy rich people asking for money!! /v FLOPYONCE SHOULD HAVE ORGAGNIZED IT . YET THE SLUT WASNT EVEN THERE /v anybody notice the colors of the two hands of the original image? is it the BLACKS being helped by the COMMUNISTS? hmmmm. /v Dumb kids. Probably Hillary supporters. Throwing money at artists who live in luxurious palaces. Like they give a shit. The way they treated Bernie was deplorable. /v Bump that. Always the same- aome bs devastation via crisis,& then another fundraiser?? How much of the proceeds go directly towards feeding, clothing, ans possibly re-building/housing how many thousands that have bewn displaced?? Somoene please tell me. Preferrably somekne who actually has inside info. ahmehrikkkan redd kross,= And\n\nand plenty others of those supposed feed the hungry damn infomercials. #GTFOH #Want to really help?? /v What a bunch of fucking phonies...As fake as you can get. /v This is bullshit pathetic useless celebrities!! Why do this crap to raise money? Why not just go and give money those needed!! They have millions and millions of dollars and yet they are singing to raise money! Celebrities i wish you go to hell! /v I hate that they are taking this opportunity to slip in identity politics and their own agenda at the expense of this tragedy. Like really? /v nobody made a joke about trump or called him out ?? WOOOOOOOOW i cant belive it /v Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves. God bless  /v Beyonce had the most stupid bullshit speech I've heard the past 5 years of my life.

Its not about simply throwing money as the issue, its about uniting in time of crisis. /v Did you my husband is on this? /v Forget about raving about your favorite stars, or putting down the government and the Presidents- current and past.  This event was about the displaced people and the help they need.  God expects us to love one another and this is a very good place to start!  Did all of you who have left comments about your stars or bad feelings about the government donate anything or are you just wasting energy that could be used in helping others?  Stop for a second and think what you can do to help your fellow man, woman and child who might be in need.  Maybe you cannot give the $25 they are asking for, but you can give smaller amounts- every amount is accepted. /v **MTV is Liberal Propaganda** don't trust them. /v Heck Beyonce snd Jay Z have enough to give 100 million and not even miss it. /v thanks Mtv for make this video..\nthanks to all celebs and peoples who were help hurricane.....\nmay Allah give them all stuff and happiness... plz   Aameen /v Beyonce preach! /v where is nicki minaj? /v demi  /v O Justin cantou? /v Beyonce at 12:31 /v Blake's voice  /v Turkey loves Demi. /v Justin 18:18 /v En que minuto sale JB Y SELENA ? /v Awww Justinn  /v MTV needs your money people. s jws gotta eat yo /v All my donations are going to true american trump supporters ONLY!

LIGHT BALLANCE AND COLIN THROUGH PLEASEEEE IT WILL BE AWESOMEE /v Why do you asshats find it necessary to expose how the trick was done. Of course it was a trick! No one is a wizard, you morons. It's like your tiny little minds can't stand it when someone entertains millions with a trick. Oh, I saw he had a piece of paper oh, it was forced. Of course it was a force! Who cares!!! He came on national TV, several times now, and was voted through. Just be entertained. Or are your tiny little minds incapable of that?

I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding. That's usually where the magic happens. /v I liked the trick. Time for kids to tell me I'm a retarded idiot! If you think your so smart then think about this, this is one guy who is trying to entertain you while being pressured by the millions of people to trick them. It's him vs all of the viewers and anybody with half a brain knows every trick has a reveal but that does not make it bad. Also no your 6 year old son did not solve the trick because you are most likely too young to have one. /v This seems more true then before, have improvement /v This was like watching now you see me where they rob that Bank in Paris. /v If it wasnt prepared with judges, this guy has my respect /v It's like Jesus gave up the savior gig and went into mentalism. /v his he predict the end of the word this coming sep.23? /v Mel changes her hair like most people change their clothes @_@ /v Yes his trick is obvious. But me personally. I like his presentation. I like how he always starts the presentation with something random (how did he known howie's passcode?) And then they way he talks and the way he looks and how humble he is. And I also like how he's not a singer. He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive. /v This is mind blowing. But we all know a singer or a dancer will win /v He should be the winner /v THIS MAN IS NOT FROM THIS WORLD DUDE /v I know how he did it. When he grabbed the paper that Mel picked he had a little piece of paper in his hand it put it over the paper that was grabbed off the table and just made sure his finger was at the spot when they said stop. /v I noticed he took the paper with his left hand and then for a split second with his right he put something on the paper. It was a small sticker .notice how he kept his right hand on THE paper the whole time? /v this guy is part of the show. hes like a cast. hes not gonna win. Hes just like a filler, to keep the show entertaining. /v What kind of demon is he /v Did no one tell this dude he looks like Hitler /v Ok, he sure is very good at messing around with unconcious mind /v Cool but, I got a triple kill in BO2 with an RPG once /v u can tell mel is single. /v Hello Americans..please let this man win..A magician deserves to win AGT 2017...enough of singers.. /v This guy deserves to win. My opinion /v is the best M best on this planet /v I predict that he will win the show. /v Simple. Tiny sticker on his finger. He places it when Heidi zeroes in on her chosen area on the card. Look at when its zoomed in. The choices are literally smaller than the size of his fingertip making it easily stickable on the card. /v Now you see me 3 /v i think he put a sticker or something on the card that mel chose to make it look like she chose ellen rome cheese and heidi was in on it /v The hell happened to Mel's hair /v Am i the only one who noticed that he is dressed as Mr. Bean.. /v He added the sticker after she picked .  also you can see he wouldnt let go of the paper when Heidi was trying to grab it to read. /v I need this guy in my life /v The singers are great the dancers are amazing but this my friends IS TALENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ONE OF A KIND! I am shoook! /v SO insane you can see him sticking the tweet on top of another one. Big whoop. /v Can u guys help me get 200 subscribers I'm so close please I'll be so happy /v I would assume this to be some masterful slight of hand where he slipped the paper from a hidden spot is his sleeve then forced to selection of the tweet on Heide. Much better done than the last time where he made a terrible mistake /v *I want somebody to explain what he did*\nPeople catch the tricks all time.  I can't on this one. /v 3:05 watch at .5x speed. You can  see he cups the tweet in his hands  and puts it on the paper /v It's not about the piece of paper in his hand. It's about how he is able to mentally convince an entire audience that magic is real with a simple trick. /v Don't bring this guy into the Dunkin' Save again America!!!!! /v this guy is a global threat lol /v Mell looks like a better looking Elsa.....\n\nFor those of you who don't know who Elsa is, shes my ex-friend....\n\n\n\n\ncold hearted bitch /v WOW. You guys better give him a 10. /v I figured it out. At 3:06, after Mel hands him the card, he takes his right hand out of his pocket and puts what I would assume a sticker on there and then forces her to stop on Ellen, Rome, Cheese. Still a fantastic performance! /v Alright as much as I hated his last 2 very fake acts this one has be stumped /v MAGIC TRICK REVEALED:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe palms a sticker containing the desired tweet Ellen Rome Cheese, then at 3:17 he rubs the sticker on to the card and forces Heidi to read the tweet even though she didn't pick that tweet. /v This act wasn't that good... To do the trick he had a sticker in his hand and when Heidi said stop he places the sticker on top of the previous tweet so he already knew it was going to be Ellen Rome Cheese /v OMG!!! I'm Impressed!!! Now we can believe in Magic XD /v He's winning /v WTF BRUH!!!!!! /v Cool AF /v Wondering whos tweet is that? /v  /v oh my god  wizard men ! /v How how how hooooooooow????????! /v Vote him American!! /v   /v staged af /v what is hapenning /v COLIN WEARS A WIG?!?!?!?! /v I want his superpowers /v Hole sh** /v Mel B is secretly Elsa /v Oh my HELLLLL!!! /v HOW /v OMFG.... This Man Is Incredible  /v WOW !  /v WUTTTT DAAAA FUUQQQQQ /v OMG  /v cheeseus christ thats insane!!! /v AUTOMATICALLY WINS. *FATALITY.* /v Elsa is in AGT /v Illuminati confirmed /v mel blue /v WHAAAAAAAAAAT /v Klu di indo ini sudah bisa disajikan sama om romy rafael.. cuma ini penyajiannya lbh keren njir.. nice.. /v If you notice when he picks up the paper that Mel gave him he puts a sticker on. And then he forces the stop by hiedi which is not hard for any decent magician /v iPhone X hands on!  Would you choose this or Note 8? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKMLoDswF0 /v Are you fair? /v iPhone 7 = no headphone jack , iPhone X=no fingerprint scanner , iPhone 11= no phone  /v give me /v I love Apple /v Bullshit /v i pick iPhone 8 plus /v Lol still no aux. no fingerprint sensor. apples behind samsung once again. Sup Jon!!! /v Favourite feature:  iPhone X itself. :) /v F of /v https://goo.gl/2xE8fM\na true site to win\n   /v FACE ID FAIL. /v  /v Sheeps /v It looks soo good  /v RIP Touch ID /v Giveaway please bro /v Nice phone /v None /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhV5a2OGk30 /v I want!!!!...#iphoneX /v iPhone X tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQmodzc3oc /v Ahhh! AHHHhhhhhh! AHHHHHHHH! NEEEEEERRRRRDDDDDDDSSSSSS!!!! /v 0:39 WTF LADY! /v Wow i want that iphone 10th.  /v iphone x wwwwwooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooooo /v Omg IPhone X giveway yes please /v awesome /v I subscribed /v Traffic light camera /v The most excited and awaited iphone XD /v I bet everybody wants to get that phone but are talking shit just because they can't afford it :-) /v people who are not interested in the iPhone 10 will eventually drool over it when see it personally. /v this guy has personal nigger /v The facial recognition for sure. Plus the entire casing and the big screen. Loving those with the iPhone 10 /v Take a look at the charger haha\nhttp://amzn.to/2f59rju /v Nova launcher does that they copied android with this 999 bucks atached a 6 core really most high end android are 8 core or higher /v Is  reachability  gone now from iPhone X ?\nIf it is so then i think Apple has dropped an important feature. \nIt is much more required now in that screen size /v > hands on > most of the video is a man in a room /v Giveaway? Can't wait. I'm new to the apple family haha /v Well now we can't even hold our phone while it's charging /v Pause at 0:28, you're welcome. /v People are saying this looks like the s8, but the s8 has a bezeled display so I'm confused... /v Everything? :/ There are many other things I'd like to see /v i love everything about the iPhone X (ten)!!!!!! /v Jonathan Morrison and iJustine want the silver X. Classic look. I know what Jon Rettinger is getting... \n\nLess fingerprints will be shown in most indoor lighting.\n\nCan be recognized easily as a X with the vertical camera hump and not be mistaken as a black 7 from afar. \n\nKinda a throwback to the two-toned original iPhone that helped launch their YouTube/tech career.\n\nSilver X it is.  Even my space gray SE isn't consistently all black from front and back and it's the most beautiful iPhone ever made. /v The last time I was this early the iPhone still had a headphone jack /v Wayyyy to expensive, I'm completely neutral to all smartphones but the iPhone X is just a Galaxy S8 that costs $300 dollars more /v So no touch id? Wow what a trash a phone /v I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks. /v I have a feeling that everyone you know will be able to unlock your phone with face id cos they can just hold up a picture of your face and it will just unlock /v Stainless steel looks ugly on it too shiney. Should've stayed with aluminum. /v Cool! But that price tag tho... /v Are updates for Mobile Legends on iOS still late? If not, ML would be sweet on this expensive little shit. /v Screen!! hands down is my favorite feature of iPhone X /v The iPhone x wipes your butt while you watch videos the iPhone x is garbage and rubbish and has no real actual crap to offer you but go ahead and spend a grand on me I am the iPhone x I will know your secrets and I will keep your soul I will tell you that there are new things when there really isn't my megapixels have not changed and stayed the same since the iPhone 5 yes my camera can now clearly detect a pimple on ones butt. just remember the iPhone X is the best and I am your phone God come to me my Apple peasants please Apple peasants come to me iPhone x needs your money /v I find it hilarious how all of the new iPhone's new specs have all been used before /v Face ID to steal identity and sell it to the cops. /v Do. U think u be able to pre order unlocked one as well ??? /v Does it has usb c? /v Kind of disappointed that it doesn't have touch id I hate when things change but......idk /v hey @jonathanmorrison does the  iphone give away apply to someone that doesnt live in the US? im from bahamas lol /v ....How much did it cost to get into an event like this? It couldn't have been free. Either you get in there by knowing someone (or being that someone), or you pay a lot of money. \n\n...Either way, I would never go to one of those events. And I'll never pay that much for a phone. Absolutely unreasonable in my books. /v People now: I WANT THAT IPHONE X SO BAD! *6 Years later* Kid:Look dad i got the IPHONE X! Dad:Who needs IPHONE X when ya got iphone 10 /v It costs 1159 Euros in my country /v It looks so good  /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v When has anybody went out of their way to steal your phone, if so its prob. Your fault JS /v iPhone X all the way!!! /v I love iPhones....Is it worth spending $1000 for the x? I'm leading on the no. I love all the features...but it's cost the same as a computer.  /v Why is the front of the white iPhone X black? /v Does it have like some sort of always on display? /v hillary clinton is donald trump in drag!!! https://soundcloud.com/666satx/visions-of-color-audiozine-ep7-the-cutting-edge-of-liberation /v Is the camera better than Samsung note 8 /v Love all the specks on the new iphone X /v Man i wish i could get the phone but unfurtionaly irma happen orlando got hit pretty hard /v Omg the iPhone X is soooo cool I really love it /v Ahh my top all favorites for the iPhone X is the dual 12-megapixel camera, and the placement of the flash was a genius thing. This way the flash is evenly distributed over both cameras. This will definitely result in high-quality pictures. Next is the Facial ID, now that is impeccable!! Also the 5.8 OLED Display..OMG, magnificent!! I love this upgrade!! \nThnx for the review Jonathan! /v Love that some of my favorite YouTubers all worked together to get footage!! YAY!!! /v Your video is on point as usual. I'm excited for the Face Id feature.  Thanks for the video!! /v My only question is did they mess up again or does it have a headphone jack /v home button is what makes the iPhone an iPhone /v love the new phones /v iTs So weird how we already know everything about the phone before it came out like hell i could've written their keynote . /v I want to gift it to my MOM  /v Does it have a haptic engine? (Like the home button on iphone 7!) Does anything click like iphone 7? /v I love the sharpest display and facial recognition with brand new camera features. /v I think ar is stupid /v do they give airpods or the same apple earphones? /v $1000 for entry level X?  No thanks.. the 8 Plus looks like the better buy... /v The way you talk its so professional  /v Why isn't USB c how are my Nintendo switch and iPhone X gonna get along now... /v What was the app he was playing called? /v It is not even IP86, 64 GB of storage for $1000! come on apple /v $1,000 tho? Who the fuck would pay that much for a phone? It's so stupid how crazy people go over a phone. /v '...unfortunately no 512.' Dang, to even think that's possible is insane. Just a few years ago 64gb was top notch storage, now it's standard  /v That phone is looking sexyyyy...........not /v Yeah I cant stand that top bar its so goddamn terrible looking!!!!!. For me its not about the money price I will be definitely going for the 256 gig. I dont know if I can leave touch ID. But that top bar I just cant deal with it watching movies playing games I dont know what the hell Apple was thinking about leaving the top Bar like that.. And the Face ID I still cant trust it. There was a video where a guy puts the phone up to an Apple employees face and unlocks the phone. Without his permission. So what stops the police or anybody trying to Unlock your phone without your permission. I still feel like the face ID has some security flaws.. /v I can just say that display is finally beauty.And it's made by Samsung Not bad. /v Lol all the people walking behind Jonathan and the giving the the look xD /v this dude is the food Sherlock . /v Written,write and produced by Nigahiga. /v this is just like ryan higa theories....\nI LIKE IT!!! /v The hardest question ever. What do i want to eat? /v I tried that once. My Ex-wife still did not like my choices. Note the EX added to the wife part. /v My bf birthday is not til late nov and I'm already stressing out hard core on where to take him out to eat /v 0:19 the date on Phil's phone is September 13, but the day this video is published is on September 12!  /v I've actually been using charcoal powder for a couple of months now and noticed a HUGE improvement with the whitening and general hygiene of my teeth.

What did you kill it for?  /v That juice is really the salt water that gets injected into the dead bird you're about to eat. The bird was also fed arsenic and makes your cancer risk go up from what your risk would be just from the animal protein, which all turns on igf-1 in your body causing all cancer cells to grow. Then there's the heart disease risk, as chicken has almost the same amount of cholesterol and saturated fat as beef. /v GO VEGAN or live a shorter more depressing life. /v what the fuck is this? subscribed /v Wtf did i just watch /v lame reddit style shit vid /v Silly geese  /v    18+  http://tinyurl.com/y8uoaa4p /v Sooooooooo  juicyyyyyyyyyy....... /v You gotta rub the chicken\n\n*YEHEA BOI INTENSIFIES* /v Is this Alex g /v 1:11 aids can /v Pepper Pepper Pepper /v Lol /v You suck at cooking  /v congrats on trending! /v BEST.

Now, let's just say you screamed Denise Hemphill's name and I do not come a-runnin'. That means I'm not on the premises. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Imagine if they ran into a bear /v That looks like a level raiser. /v The downside side of downsizing house cats dogs the occasional bird of prey just became Godzilla and you're now on their menu, elephants rhinos cows horses became living natural disasters, a Sprinkle or a daytime shower just became a deluge of biblical proportions thunderstorms became hurricanes and dust devils F5 tornadoes, firecrackers just became moab's and a weapon just became a nuke /v this looks so silly, but so fun, im glad its not a serious movie, more of a light hearted comedy with a serious real life problem that effects us today, and will do moreso in the future, but done in a non-serious tone, im gonna watch this :P /v This is hurting my brain knowing which is the correct size. /v This idea was stolen from an episode of Sponge Bob Squarepants. /v Matt Damon was my celebrity crush when I was like 14 lol /v Just like teleportation, it's probably more like cloning ones body in a smaller form then incinerating the original. /v I can't believe this wasn't an 80s movie... /v What an original premise! I'm definitely going.\nAlso, Kristen Wiig is going places!\nSNL really is a talent factory... /v Steve Martin Let's Get Small\nhttps://youtu.be/WPgurvq6MIU?t=1m50s /v Now this is the shit! /v the idea of the movie is great but what about Birds insects rain animals in general and aren't you going to die from hypothermia if you're outside in the winter hopefully they explain some of this otherwise great idea /v How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that. /v My first thought was that this looks like a crapy comedy movie but it looks more like a interesting light hearted movie instead. I'm going to keep my eye on it and if it gets decent reviews I'll go to see it. /v Interesting, though now since they are small wouldn't they be further down on the food chain and wild animals, insects and such would most likely kill them? /v so it's Honey I Shrink the kids for adults /v 1:52 Divorce papers. Yeah. That just killed my desire to buy a movie ticket. I'll wait for the Blu-ray instead. /v I love the idea except one thing - INSECTS, THE ANIMAL KINGDOM NO. /v The only remedy to over population is the extermination of areas with excessive birth rates. Places like Africa, the middle East and Asia. /v they brought Young Sheldon\nNow they made small Demon\nwhat is going on. /v Wow can't believe I never thought of this for the overpopulation problem I really want to see this movie ,I want to see how this all plays out /v Very interesting. Randomly clicked on this and was not disappointed. Can anyone tell me the name of the song? /v @ last a new film with some meaning! /v yeeeeiiiii i cant wait to watch this movie /v This is a cute way of getting people on board with voluntary genocide for the betterment of Earth. /v You already know Id set up an underground insect fighting ring and make tons of money. /v I love the concept.  I couldnt help thinking though, what happens when it rains/hails, would it wipe out a city?  What happens if a band of fire ants move in? It will be interesting to see if they address any of the issues they would have. /v So... the adult version honey I shrunk the kids? /v And then the insects come.... /v And then a stray cat finds its way in and eats everyone /v What if hank pym was a sharer /v Where's the wife? /v ant man would be jealous /v Am I the only one here that noticed that Dave Johnson and Carol are references to Portal's Aperture Science leaders: Cave Johnson and Carolina (GlaDos)? /v If it's got Kristen Wiig in it, then its got me in the cinema. (Also it looks really interesting.) /v Wouldn't it be easier to make the food larger, instead of making everything but the food smaller? /v They finally got the Gnomish World Enlarger working! /v There just copying 'Honey I Sheunk the kids' ,\nThey just stole that idea from 1970 Super Friends Cartoon,\nInteresting someones remaking the 'Getting Shrinked' premise\n\nCan yous just drink bleach and eat shit. Shut the fuck up /v what about rain, won't it kill them /v did his wife failed the shrinking process cause I couldn't see any shrunken version of  her in the trailer /v Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart /v Really curious to see how the premise of this movie is construed as an Aesop. There are so many ways this movie can be manipulated to present a specific moral standpoint. /v Why does Matt Damon sound like Owen Wilson in this? Wtf /v Saw the thumbnail and thought this looks stupid. Watched the trailer and I'm very intrigued. Good for Paramount to pick up something with a quirky premise :) /v That's a stupid idea... imagine being attacked by an ant or a cockroach.. /v I think the whole shrinking process is an inside project orchestrated by the government to kill as many people as possible with efficiency. /v Looks great! So what happens top his wife? /v Someone's was watching macross frontier. /v Who is Hong Chau? Am I supposed to know who she is? /v i honestly thought this movie was about losing jobs. thumbs up if you did too. /v The document he is signing says defendant, I'm guessing his wife dies getting shrunk and he gets in some legal situation metaphor on little guy against the big guy /v 1:34. \n\nLol. That's the first thing a man will check, all okay down there and women would check if both of them are okay up there. /v This is like the modern version of honey I shrunk the kids LMAO  /v But then you have rid all the current furniture and current cars and buildings have to be renovated etc.....isnt that more pollution and landfill /v I remember... I remember everything... I'm no longer Jason Bourne. /v When it is out?  /v Isn't population implosion more of a existential crisis facing humanity than over population? I love Matt Damon, wish he'd do sci-fi movies based on real or likely hypothetical situations again. Such as contagion. /v Who else watched the trailer like a thousand time? /v Great. A film about my downstairs. /v Square Cube Law.. but I don't really care, it is a fun idea of a movie. /v So this is how Attack on Titan started /v Soooo what happens when a spider comes to visit their town? Lol /v Whoever stole my copy of Microsoft Office, I will track you down...\n\nYou have my Word. /v I see the live-action Pikmin movie is looking great /v I love the picture of Paramount, where did you take the photo? /v Imagine the sexual possibilities... /v I feel like something nefarious is afoot /v Shrunk - https://youtu.be/Wn7RE8zycJQ ;D /v FUCK YEAH /v What lol /v This makes me uncomfortable /v This looks cute. Nice popcorn type movie. /v HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS /v whats this rebooting of? /v Honey, I shrunk the kids: The reboot. /v WOW WOW WOW /v So, shrinky dinks the movie? /v Wtf that song is really dope! /v that vodka bottle!;) /v Lol /v Sren Pilmaaark!!!! /v This looks good  /v Down syndrome matt damon /v Honey, I shrunk the Wiig!! /v nice /v Absolutely moronic idea. Stupid hollywood jewish propaganda /v lk bata gsterilen yerde trke olarak byk karakterlerle kongre merkezi yazlm olmas da ilgin. /v Cringe. This movie is about white people firing their employees and making the rest do more work, e.g, downsizing. Another abhorrent piece of shit from hollywood. /v Ddduuuuuuude this was filmed at my school tho XD /v Trash and I like fergie but this shit is not good .. /v So glad she's back /v Nicki Minaj looks like a melted Galaxy bar covered in Golden Retriever fur... /v Sorry fergie for my words. but, you are succesfull when you be with black eyed peas. now you are join to garbage music industry.  this is sad. /v Sounds like the song  You know you like it by Dj snake /v FILM TUBE new Channel Frequency \n                            ..  /v I was expecting a real awesome video like taylor to reate a viral buzz but this is shit !

Very few concrete buildings in the other islands hit by Irma had their walls come down /v Only 10, that's not bad at all /v Every one let's help the best we can it's time to make a change!! /v Here it's the real part Cuba get 50% european and 30% Canadian tourist. Not Americans alow in Cuba but yea America it's the only country the world expect to give aid and food to Cuba. How ironic.. /v People die all the time...100 died in car wrecks yesterday... I'm dying rite no....w.... /v just 10? God dammit....step it up nature. at this rate it'll take thousands of years for the humans to go extinct.  gotta upgrade the hurricanes. /v I can't believe people are actually complaining that it was 10 people. 10 people could have been your loved ones or even you. They are brothers, sisters, mothers, aunts, uncles to someone. If you have nothing positive to say. Leave. /v Far-left journalists before Irma = Cuba has the best protocol to protect their citizens, they will have no casualties\nAfter Irma = . . . . . . . . . . /v Best of luck to Cuba. As a south Floridian, I've experienced wilma and now Irma. Both felt identical in damages. Depressing aftermath for both storms but blessed that both were far from catastrophic. Irma was a storm that only hit the Caribbean hard. I can only imagine how bad it is in Cuba right now. Sending my condolences to the lives lost. /v Not in the Subject but..\n\n\n\n\n\nWas that Jacob Satrorius in the Thumbnail /v 10 ppl dead in cuba  NUMBERS DONT ADD UP LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE TBH /v I don't feel sad oh well /v They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep /v its so sad that many people have never experienced how cubans live . i, myself am cuban . i was born there but moved to america. many people dont understand that simple evacuation is hard . and with trump not letting cubans enter america easily is much worse . and for the people saying 10 is nothing . its A LOT. most cubans are often acquainted with many people and everyone is very caring for everyone else and people are very close. So 10 is a lot even though it seems like nothing here ,its a lot for Cubans. And in regards that Cubans barely have any health , medicine or basic living supplies most Cubans die of diabetes and many other diseases and its very sad. /v I thought it was 39 in Cuba... /v It broke concrete buildings, prayers to Cuba! /v How's there's only like 4 people left in cuba /v almost my whole family lives in cuba i pray for them\n\n1 like = ok im not even going to do it /v 10 is not a lot of people. /v noone can seriously think this wouldnt happen lol. throw a large storm into an area with shacks and dirt poor people. tis life /v 10 is actually a good number, considering it was the strongest storm to ever hit Cuba. And let she honest, Cuba isn't exactly a country of incredible infrastructure and solid buildings. So the death toll could have been astronomical. /v What, I can't hear you. I was attacked by sonic weaponry...... sorry, good luck. /v It didn't happen in america so we don't really care. /v People's believe in God of Sun ..and God of Sunday ... thats name of that God is Nemrod and he is in charge to help you :-(  if you pray to him...he will make to you more and more destruction...Pray to really God ,God of Abraham Isaac and Jakob ..and you can be safe .. /v Please show that people died in that video /v I can't take this comment section people are literally saying lol /v Cool just give me my edge points already /v Maybe they should get rid of the whole dictator prob /v Only 10 people dead? That's not too bad. It's sad for everyone who has to start over in life. Because I know that can be frustrating and emotional.

It's going to be years before they get out of this. /v Dear god 10 people how will they make it better /v We are strong and we will get over it...come on my people lets get up one more time  /v people wouldnt have died if they had just evacuated /v Oh god I feel so bad /v There all dead......AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!! /v I see /v fly high  /v No ... not again /v wartur /v  /v Dominican Republic was spared!! /v 10?

Well alright. /v Like a country nickel back voice /v Can't wait to hear it live - awesome rock and country don't get any better - obtained - on my ipod - now - windows down and loud as it will play - awesome /v I love this! It sounds close to Blue Jeans and a Rosary. #kidrockforussenate /v I ain't much much of a kid rock fan or really any kinda guy that would listen to his shit except maybe that picture song he did a long while back. But... This song means a lot to me. I'm a born n raised Tennessee boy outside of Memphis and even though some parts I lived wasn't country it was still a lot like these lyrics. After my service with the Navy I ended up moving out here to California because of someone I thought was an angel and a friend, still... I do miss a lot in Tennessee and one day I'll come back home. This song seems to tell me something like it's a sign I should move back... The universe has a funny way to reveal things /v Whooohooo!!!!!!  I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!! /v This is Americana right here, folks. /v I will never forgive you for your rendition of sweet home Alabama... /v Your shit and your music is shit. /v gfys kr & dt45 2 /v Why is this trash trending? /v Please stop /v Sure trending with only 50k /v Big phony /v Clicked just to dislike. /v Well that was some of the most stupid lyrics I've heard. /v I'm from TN and this is just Shit!! /v like the song...  but saying hip hop had no soul is funny i think he was talkin about his own hip hop he tried to do lol...but he made money off of it /v kid rock sucks and his a rebel traitor.hang this scum! /v Kid Rock was alright until he started hanging around hillbillies. /v Such a shame that this voice is wasted on meaningless lyrics about moronic redneck lifestyles. /v Kid Rock is a racist according to most people on the West Coast.  Is that a fact? /v I don't like it /v stuck in CA and only found demons /v Looser! /v Why does this sound like an ad?  /v He's singing about Tennessee mountain tops because there are no more mountain tops in West Virginia /v holy fuck i dont think i have seen a bigger sell out in my life /v I heard Kid Rock molests little boys /v Absolutely love an thanks for putting up.. not trying to be a ass but it's O'Keefe not oh Keith... O'Keefe is Great music school that's the only reason I wrote this!!!! But thanks for the video an of course I could be wrong.... /v This washed out loser still making shit music?  I really thought he was dead.  He should have stayed gone.  This douche is the epitome of what's wrong with America. He is also the epitome of Idiocracy prophecy come to fruition. /v Fuck kid rock for hating on another American citizen # Colin kaepernick /v nazis and right wingers not welcomed in Boston. Stay the fuck out. Support Antifa, local socialists and IWW. /v Wow I know these are just highlights but wow the Semian made a bunch of crazy needle threading passes. /v Ppl always clown on the broncos. Yet we have the toughest division in the nfl. Our games are always so close. /v The Chargers have too many defensive weapons to be that timid early on. They honestly have the potential to be a top 5 defense in the league. /v can't believe they lost the lead.. /v He made his voice deeper at 2:40 in the 2nd quarter /v The broadcasters were horrible, thanks for making us feel like you don't care about us, ESPN. Rex and some random lady, please hire an actual crew in the future. Somehow you make a great Broncos game feel like a chore. But it wasn't, was it? This was one of the best games all week!\n\nOn the Broncos front, we might have made a huge mistake by cutting TJ Ward and will be drafting Safety high next year. We still need a better O-line in places. Siemian improved a lot, Jamal Charles is old. Poor Jamal. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Rivers waits too long to get desperate..it takes 2 to 3 quarters to figurr out what is going on.

Voice is awful for football. Had to turn the sound off to rewatch the highlights. Please don't let her do anymore Bronco games! /v get women announcers out of the NFL /v Look at 1:42 and someone falls  /v Listening to that commentary made my ears hurt. This sounded like a small town college football game being called on some hand me down equipment by a pair of freshman sports casting major students. If those two ever commentate on my team's game, I'm just going to have to watch the game on mute. #c'monman /v Anyone else see the ref fall at 1:42 lmao /v Gordon is doing the badgers proud /v Half the comments are about the commentator. She is is being criticized far more than any other male commentators. People saying how she doesn't have a voice for tv, doesn't have a passion for football. Smh. Sexist people will find any reason to hold women back especially when they break into something as male dominated as football commentating. /v The prepubescent caster just seems really unenthused with this game... /v I still haven't gotten used to Phillis Rivers throwing motion /v Am I the only one who went back like 4 times to watch the ref fall?  /v Average Broncos team against a shitty Chargers team.

I can't get the spelling /v this is the content I crave /v I'd let them sandwich me /v Mario Batali looks like the wizard from the wizard of oz. shits hilarious /v Love how he says chicharon with a french accent. LOL /v Aahhaah funniest part when mario gets the money /v Mario is the man. Those sandwiches made me hungry as hell. /v Action, Sean and Mario in one video this is a gift from God /v Just when I thought this channel couldn't get any better, they bring Action Bronson and Mario Batali in for a sandwich showdown. Anthony Bourdain has to be next. /v Now I'm hungry for some sandwiches. /v You know Bronson loves to cook when he cook's his opponent's submission too lol /v i wish i could eat ass like mario batali eats a sandwich /v Fuck! Now I'm hungry lol /v oh man I love Action Bronson we went to the same Hebrew School in Brooklyn L'Chaim! /v Not gonna lie, the first time I saw BamBam on hot ones I thought he was a bit of a dick. But now the more I see of y'all collaborating the more he comes off chill, and personable. /v I just bought the book /v those look so much better on bruce lee /v Such a great episode /v I want Sean to give me some bowl tossing action... if you know what I mean... /v Sean just has to get fat to fit into his network /v I love bronson but every food he makes is a fucking mess, probably tastes great but doesnt look fun to eat at all..  and sean,for someone who dislikes trump you sure do like using his phrases. /v You manage to get hold of people like Matty Matheson AND Action on top of all your other guests? This channel is killing it. /v Lol its a fat covered sandwich topped with fat of course it tastes amazing!!! /v sean evans is speaking to the dominican in me with that salami /v Oh hell yeah guys, because there is nothing more appetizing than watching three fat, bald, white American slobs sucks each other off. Get the fuck out... /v who eats sandwiches like those?? they're huge!!! :D /v I wish my first name was Action.  It probably should be. /v Most 420 friendly sandwiches I've ever seen. /v He needs a hairnet over that beard. Also it's not good to eat the cheese before you make the sammy because it becomes too familiar by the time you eat the sammy and it DETRACTS FROM THE MEAL. /v if i only find a girl looking at me like the guy looks at the sandwich at 6:45 /v this fat boi looks like that noah ritter kid from ellen in about 25 years /v Bronson needs his own restaurant and I need to visit /v I'm not impressed. /v No homo, but Action Bronson has pretty eyes /v Great chemistry between sean and bigsexyDaddy!

Stupid ass mf /v Batali is an old, flamboyant, slob who is trying way too hard to stay relevant. /v I love Action has Supreme confidence when in reality he has no idea what he is talking about. He is a cook at best and I don't think even he would call himself a chef. /v Both of those look like inedible hunks of fat. \n\nTake the fat on the griddle from Bronson's, toast some bread, then use his cheese and add some tomato and other veggies and it would be a good sandwich. /v I think this seen evenscareerisbeing made fun of /v What a great fucking video God bless all you guys /v WOAH.. is Sean tall as fuck?

He wasn't nationalist, he always said nation isn't ethnicity, but humility and determination - exactly what republicans say today. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Shouldn't it just be illegal to pardon your buddies from the campaign trail? I mean that seems like a huge abuse of power. /v just a friendly reminder that john oliver sucks asshttps://soundcloud.com/666satx/visions-of-color-audiozine-ep7-the-cutting-edge-of-liberation /v On psychologist wrap thin different forest extensive character bite occasionally. /v John  Oliver's a Racist Scum. /v if conservatives are so keen on upholding the constitution and all american rights, they seem pretty quick to throw them out the window if it satisfies their need for putting other people down. /v If Donald Trump meant Job in a biblical sense... he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about he's just spouting words he is allowed to say on camera... /v Don't you people get it now? Legal , illegal only applies to certain people. /v Let's see how tough this racist old fuck is when released among the inmates in his own tent city. He would shit his geriatric diapers before even getting there. Toughest Sheriff... please. May Arpaio rot in prison. Criminal scumbag. /v I agree 100%, Sheriff Arpaio should not have been pardoned and should have gone to one of his own jails.  \n\nBut where were you, Mr. Oliver, when President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera?  As bad as Sheriff Arpaio was, and I think his deliberate malfeasance killed people, he wasn't in the same league as Mr. Rivera.  Among other felonies, he was the head bombmaker for a terror group, the FALN, that claimed credit for 120 bomb attacks, killing six and injuring dozens.  There are parallels: as with Sheriff Arpaio, Mr. Rivera was unrepentant and as with President Trump's pardon, President Obama's commutation was popular with a slice of his constituency. /v Quick fact check....the record for highest temp in AZ is 128 degrees in 1994. Not 145 like in the video. /v This barely scratches the surface of corruption, cruelty and abuse of his office. I'm surprised Oliver didn't warn about the door left wide open for the Russia investigation. If Arpaio gets an instant pardon for his political and ideological fuckery, anyone who doesn't want to testify in the Russia investigation cannot realistically be threatened with contempt of court and appropriately jailed because Trump will just let them off the hook, which is by definition obstruction of justice; the exact reason this investigation is taking place. /v Wait john that story is false his white privilege stopped them form beating him to death ....cops dont hurt white people or white privilege wouldnt exist they need to fire this closet white supremacist and get a true black man up in there #supporteryourlocalantifa /v Hey l would appreciate if you followed my account if you are interested in minimalistic and aesthetics fotos@z.e.serin /v Sad I can only dislike once /v John you whiny baby typical of liberal tards, this guy stands up for the law and in typical left anarchist fashion you climb on him, why not sit and go through all the lovely characters your god obama pardoned you idiot. /v He's the kind of guy that visits whores because his wife is so Christian she would not suck his dick, telling it's evil. Yet arrests said prostitutes later on because they committed a crime. Double standards. /v He pardoned a man backing federal laws... Dumbama and Clinton pardoned drug dealing MURDERS AND TERRORISTS!! /v Oliver can legally run for a U.S. senate seat, if he is a naturalized citizen. Please move to Kentucky and help us #ditchmitch. Thank you. /v John oliver, you're a high-maintenance little flower cuck!  Just kidding, doing my best standard youtube commenter impression /v The USA is not a racist country, it has a president with down syndrome even... /v When I have a child I'll tell them that I survived this shit show of a president. /v I love this. This limey douche bag talking about the politicization of his office? Really??? What about the cocksucking Obama? \n\nNot that sucking dick is wrong. He should just own up to it. /v If Justice Anthony Kennedy retires, will DTrump fill the seat with, Lord love a duck, Joe Arpaio?     #shudder /v I still dont know why LastWeek Tonights videos get dislikes. Be a hardline idiot but youre still gonna laugh at the show. If not Mr. Oivers jokes /v Didn't watch, down voted the video. :^) /v Are you insane?\n If Sheriff Arpaio had used Hitlerian rhetoric in his rallies he would've been exposed years ago. It's easy to label him a racist when you have the Leftist propaganda machine (in print, tv and cable news) backing you. Oliver's a glib dunce that never has to answer any of his verbal diarrhea because it's under the rubric of Comedy.\nEnjoy your pabulum. /v This tv show became trump witch hunt tube... and frankly, boring. /v Does anyone else lose faith in humanity everyday? I think we are doomed. /v I saw Sheriff Joe talk a couple of times in Phoenix...which was a VERY strange rally of VERY old white people....mostly from states outside of Arizona and just thought Joe was wonderful......but what caught my ear was his bragging that he was a WOP....which literally means WithOutpapers....he was telling this crowd that he was an illegal alien??!!  And the crowd thought that SOOOOOOOOOOo funny......from there it went dowhill with a speech of hate, rascism and basically the rants and raves heard from Hitler's mouth.....old Joe SHOULD rot/die in jail.....but seems we have to accept he will just rot in hell /v PLEASE DO A PIECE ON DUTERTE AND HIS DISREGARD OF HUMAN RIGHTS. /v Please please please, do a piece about the $20 budget for the commission on human rights in the philippines. Please john oliver. /v Arpaio should be arrested again for horribly butchering that song. /v Hey everyone!

Trump pardoned a Sheriff. Yep, Trump 2020. /v How is this fck still alive? He should be destroyed with his entire family and bloodline! Fcking scum! /v Arpaio defense was that the didn't know the 14th Amendment. You would think. a sheriff should at least know our Constitution. Arpaio is the picture perfect of incompetence. /v What was the fundamental concept of democracy? \ndivision/separation of powers or as the US people calls it: checks and balances\n\nI see that principle damaged. And that is not a good thing. /v Arpaio will die soon. He's old. Who gives a fuck? /v I'll be cheering for Joe Arpaio! Keep up the great work! /v If you're looking for illegals you target Mexicans.   If you're looking for bloods and crips you look at blacks and if you're looking for serial killers you look at white people.  It's not discrimination it's logic and basic knowledge. /v ahhhh another week with white privilege in Amerikkka, sweet /v He's clearly a sadist. I could just see him jizzing his pants when he was talking about shackling pregnant women. /v He still has more pardon's left... (thunder crashes) /v Arpaio is not my sheriff and he never will be. /v I think we all know why we watch Last Week Tonight, it makes our countries look modern in comparison to the US. :-) /v Last Week Tonight is one of my favorite shows but this season you lack a little. Why are you off for weeks at a time, then make another episode or two and are again of for weeks?? This episode is the best example. You are trying to catch up with events that have been covered extensively already instead of producing original content as usually. Please get your shit together and get back to doing a quality show. By the way 20-30 minutes is not enough, bring on a one hour show.. /v Man 4,000+ people are really ignorant. /v I wish he mentioned that one time Arpaio and Steven Segal broke up a cockfighting ring with a tank /v This  show has become one-noted and pathetic. /v This show used to be funny. Now it's tea time with bitch face /v This video baaaarely skims the surface of the stuff that's gone on in that jail, too. /v Now I hate trump lol /v What a fucking disgrace. /v fuckyou Joe Arpayo & DonLd trump, you two Gays /v I am sargent 0 fucks given /v WTF /v Scumbag asshole /v 4k dislikes?

Checks and balances?? Hello??? /v Can anyone find out how Apaio's parents got here from Italy, legally or illegally ;) /v This is probably the most fucked up think trump has ever done and has nothing to do with being rightwing. This isnt even an american thing to do , do people in the crowd just cheer for anything he says lol. Im not even left wing but this is truely fucked up /v Why is it not available /v I love when there's continnuous segments if the show, thank you /v So in summation,  a bunch of trash elected trash, who pardoned trash. /v This show is a good thing /v Guess who's the hitler baord game actually exists :))) /v I think it is clear that Trump and Republican Party thinks that everything Arpaio did is the job of all police departments of the USA. /v I'll bet he took the blows  /v Y'know when your 67 year old history teacher is being strict and giving you tons of work. Joe is his nutsack. Crusty, old, and probably a pedophile. /v My uncle used to be a mean bastard, like Arpiao. Terrorized everyone around him. We kids hated him. Eventually, he grew too old to care for himself, and the adults around him grew too old as well. Those last ten years, at the mercy of people he once treated like shit, were like hell for him. Arpiao will know this same fate. /v This British gift is funny when muted... /v I don't give a shit if criminals die.  Stop breaking the law!!!!!! /v John Oliver looks like a fucking pickle with glasses. /v And that right there is one of the reasons why I hate trump.  It shows that he is somewhat of a racist. /v British people talking shit about America and it's praised , fuck arpio he is a devil but wow /v How do people watch this hack? I get that his team got trending and everything but he is legit cringe inducing /v I hate this man. /v **Liberal propaganda** /v http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/ /v #dibs /v Arpaio be looking like SQUEEZED LIME !!! /v its ok..now have it...burger 321! /v Lol. Hashtag Feminism joke was great. /v Please subscribe to my channel /v OMG....OMFG.......get some NEW material.............same old, same old, same old president bashing... NEW material EVER??? /v Did this dipshit ever talk about Chelsea manning or the Puerto Rican bomber getting pardoned by OBOZO? I'm waiting /v hi. im Joe. im charged, by the people of Arizona, to enforce the law of the land while selfish faux intellectuals & other  scumballs call me racist & nazi from behind a desk. /v IMPEACH CORRUPT RACIST BULLY DONALD HITLER MAKE USA GREAT AGAIN /v Your makeup  /v hair awesome /v Her Eyes are Just Waohhhh  /v Your makeup!!!  /v Rollerball face glitter! /v Hairstyle tutorial? /v I love the 90s!!!! /v I LOVE HER MAKUP LOOK /v Love the Hair!!!! /v Coobudle got them at target /v AMAZING lol /v OMG you are so pretty, <3 /v Makeup goals  /v That highlight tho  /v http://www.caboodles.com/ /v Omg your eyes! /v Loveeee ur hair today omg u gotta tell how u did that doo gurl!!!

I bought one just like that from walmart a year ago, also that card has a Facebook and Twitter tag at the bottom. /v I can't remember if it was the 90s or early 00s when Bon Bell or how ever its spelled made those slide up lipsticks. Dark grey tube and you slid the little thing up the side and the lid flipped open. I can still smell them lol My first lipstick and it was so much like the color of the one you have on. So now i'm feeling nostalgic and i NEED to know what lip that is so i can get one lol /v I think I spied with my eyes, tiny crimped hair on the back of your buns? Am I right Bunny? /v I was expecting a little more than whats in there. \nAlso should of had Bon Bons mini nail polish, that resonates more to my 90s child self. lol /v Okay but you can still get every one of these items at your local dollar general . Except for the caboodle and magazine obviously. /v I remember eating chapstick once when I was little lol surprisingly survived /v Wow blast to the past. New Kids on the Block was the first concert I ever went to. Donny's the bad boy. Why do I actually remember so well? I remember because after the concert we went back stage, saw the guys get in their vehicles and started walking. Donny with his convertable full his buddy's offered my friend and I a ride home. He was shocked when I told him no thank you, but what's a 15 year old good girl to say to a car full of guys while her bestie is mute in awe? /v I would wear my mood ring all the time when I was in middle school. I pulled it out because I wanted to wear it now! Lol! /v I bought Hard Candy polish in '96 from Nordstroms. Light blue and yellow, with the rings. Hard Candy was kinda high end when it first came out. /v Funny thing i just bought the exact same pink caboodle at target a month ago as my makeup box broke /v What's the website?! /v My mood ring is turning black and I'm not sure how I feel about it /v Guys I need all the prayers I can get please and Thankyou /v I still have my caboodles! It is black with pink polka dots. Still holds all my hair stuff. /v I just can't get over this look tlday, the outfit, the jewelry ,makeup!!!, hairrrr!!!! eeeeee all it's perfect /v I have that cabooble. I bought it at Walmart and see it there all the time /v BUNNY I LIKE YOUR HAIR & MAKEUP IN THIS /v GIRL YOUR HIGHLIGHT BE POPPIN and I think periwinkle is a good color for you  /v Her makeup is great /v There was a girl in my nineth grade English class who ate her eos chapstick /v I have that Caboodle for my daughter's her accessories. And it does have some scrunchies  /v Bunny, you should do a video that shows how you do your sassy buns /v Love your look in this video. Gothy sassy... /v I can smell it i have two of rhe exact deodorant teen spirit pink crush /v OMG those little hair clips! All the cool girls wore them. We didn't braid, we did little twists and clasped them in a row like a headband. God, the 90's were fun. /v Most of these things are still available in stores, including caboodles. I mean, the caboodle has facebook and twitter on that card, so it's probably new /v I was born in 1991  /v Bunny when you talked about the boy eating the Dr. Pepper Lipsmacker  I had to laugh. It used to be one of my favorite and when my son was really little he would take them and eat them as well, lol! He was actually obsessed with any flavored lip smacker , but it was usually Dr. Pepper. I ended up ordering him the cute little Avon lip balms special for kids and taught him to use them like a big boy and he could carry his own. Lol! Memories! /v They have an app for guess the slogan go check it out lol(: love you bunny /v Oh,... wanted them but aside from the scrunchies everything is sold out /v That's how Kurt Cobain wrote Smells Like Teen Spirit from!  Some girls were making fun of him for wearing it and graffiti ed on his wall.  So he took that sentence and wrote the song Smells Like Teen Spirit!  Look it up!  Too cool! /v Oh my God You should get the board game LoGo it's all about different brands and their logos you would probably love it and be really awesome at it  /v Bunny's bunchies in her hair look fabulous /v i love this ! i remember i had a glitter gloss who was eadible and i actually drank it bcs it was so good and tasted like candy xD /v 1998... BUNNY NOOOOOO!! I wasn't even born yet! February 1999 /v I remember some girl used to eat elmer's glue everyday when we were kids!!!! /v I came into this world in 1999. I was alive but an infant. /v They should have put in a Seventeen or Sassy mag instead of People mag. No 90s teen read People magazine lol. /v That people magazine came out like right before I was born  /v Beautylish should be writing you a check! They are almost sold out of everything and you know it's because of this video! I graduated in '96 and miss my Caboodle! /v I've gotten 3 caboodles as a gift /v The bad boy in New Kids On The Block is Donnie Wahlberg. /v I have to say, I LOVE your hair.  I am regrowing mine, but I am pretty sure a 50+ year old woman can't pull that off. (however, idk....if I could do that- even if it meant using extensions-I might just do it for kix!) that is absolutely beautiful. Maybe when My granddaughter is older..... lol  anyway PLEASE do a tutorial! /v She is the master of sassy buns /v I was born August 13th 1990!!! How crazy! Lol /v Do you remember when CoverGirl used to have Noxzema  in it...  /v I'd love to see more videos like this! /v Pssssst Bonnie Bell lipsmaker go back to the 70s and I think Dr. Pepper was around. It's so long ago. /v I literally bought this box at Walmart the other day. Same one lol /v There is a game like that called Logo :) /v Bunny... whyyyy do you have a tickle me Elmo in the closet behind you? Lool /v You can still get all of these /v I hate myself I inhaled when she held the teen spirit to the camera  /v Most of this stuff is just sitting in my room or I've given it to my littler sister who loves that all her 90's stuff is the real deal lol XD /v If the caboodle is from the 90s, why does the insert tell u the links to their fb? /v Lol all of this is still available in stores for less /v thanks bunny  totally having teen years flashbacks now ... /v i have a 90s caboodle that still has makeup from the 90s in it (manic panic eyeshadow, hard candy nail polish in the original colors, urban decay nail polishes in asphyxia and smog) as well as the plastic bugs i left everywhere i left.  meeeeeemories, light the corners of my miiiiiiiind... /v I still have my vintage Caboodle from the late 80's/early 90's!  I've had it close to 30 years and still use it for my makeup storage. /v I had the butterfly clips!!! /v Tired of the philosophy add !!!!!!! /v Slogan games are a real thing ...google play has 4 or 5 /v So are they expired?  /v Scrunchies actually came out in the 80's and mood rings in the 70's. Just sayin /v My most fave items when I was a teenager was jelly shoes, aqua net hair spray, and anything glitter!!! Oh and leg warmers LOL!!! /v Bunnys nose highlight is brighter than my future.  \n\nLove it /v Please...what pallet are you wearing on your eyes???  Love it.  /v 1:55 the soul of Miranda Sings inhabited her body for a millisecond /v i miss the 90 ties such a happy decade. /v I just found a box full of velvet scrunchies and I'm LIVING /v You neeeeed to do a look book it would be so good cause I loooove your look   /v Omg! I love this type of video . I had that exact type of caboodle and remember all of these things  . 90s will always be hands down the best time of everything music... exc. /v I didn't really like the song /v alright... I'll take the stairs /v a fable on a realistic ground  is a cry of protest aimed at the worshippers of science and logic /v hope you will exist for many years.. /v Would this song exist if he lived on the first floor? /v Masterful video... I'm glad bands sorta feel like they have the proper outlet for making interesting videos again. It didn't make any sense there for a while but thanks to the internet, it's become quite viable and logical again. You can go pretty out there because the only judge is the audience, not some Label executive. /v For years I've always disliked Radiohead's music. I've always thought it was depressing, droning, never understood what people see in it but.......\n\nI think I get it now. It really makes you think about shit. Absolute geniuses! Fair play /v oh my god.. at last.. old radiohead.... i can feel it.... no weird sound....... electric guitar distortion violin... /v I love this song with all my heart. It reminds me of my younger days. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v the end of that video...... /v There is the guy from the paranoid android video drinking the fish bowl water!! Did someone else notice that!?! /v This sounds very bends-esque. Super excited if the rest of the album sounds like this as while I love all of radioheads stuff I really enjoyed the bends and I never thought theyd make anything like it again. /v Radiohead music never changes,\nthe same old taste! I love it! /v i've noticed a lot of the unreleased tracks are very Mogwai x red house painters -  esque.. still love it tho but i can see why they didn't the album /v I am so sick of radiohead making my head feel like a radio like all the stations playing at once.... brilliant bastards /v plant [tree of life] vs plastic bags /v i like when the guy from Paranoid Android appears /v Notice these are all characters from their last videos /v Fun fact inside Thom's bags are reasons not to go to Brazil. /v Me thinks Thom & Co. watched Marc Isaacs' documentary Lift and mixed it with feelings over the Grenfell Tower fire in West London...Sometimes such pain inspires beautiful art like this. /v This is so fucking amazing. \nThere are many references to other Radiohead's music videos! /v Damn, never knew being stuck in a lift can be such an inspiration. /v oh wait.. Its not remake of Home Alone, right? /v This clip looks like im back in 90s /v Radio head has some pretty brilliant music videos and there music is so inspirational /v Still the same amazing stuff as always.~! /v Such a good video that I didn't hear half the song. /v I swore the way this video looks I thought I was in the 90s. FeelsGoodMan /v so good to see thom again in music videos /v This is the best elevator music I've listened to /v We are lucky to have Thom /v Type of band that doesn't turn into shit with time. :') /v how to get 800 likes? /v We are all hungry for good old Radiohead melodies. Start writing beautiful songs again /v Same low-energy, moaning, overrated, pretentious crap as usual, sung by a guy who barely escaped Down Syndrome. /v Kinda looks like he descending from 18 level of hell to experience Death Reborn Life in this shit hole /v A funny Radiohead video. Something's out of order /v Wow the end is wtf /v 2:52 OMFG IS THE GUY FROM PARANOID ANDROID MUSIC VIDEO! /v what the fuck finally radiohead released a good song /v Is there a making of somewhere ? /v This reminds me of feeling like as a child you never really fit in or were understood, a feeling of being left out in the cold. But then you realize that who you are was really calling for you to get back to your authentic self a coming home of some sort. You see your self fully and realize that you were never really lost. You've come home to yourself, you are now the observer. /v Idk what's the meaning but it gives me anxiety\nI fucking hate lifts /v Wow!! loved it!\ntheres some references some previuos videos like robin *the guy with the purple beanie and the fishbowl*\n from paranoid android\n\npretty radioheadish kind of video \nawesome! /v who in their right mind downvotes Radiohead? Oo /v this song is gay as hell.. ur time is up radiohead.. stop making pussy music and move along /v Fun fact, no cell phones were used in this video. /v this reminds me of pablo honey and itch /v Thome's style at the moment is so cool, the damn 48 year old is looking better than me... /v           /v    ,    ,   Radiohead     Lift.\n  ,          ,  .                **,  9(!)  ?  , ???   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSWG90Sg9GI /v         ? /v I never thought I'd say that but this is the best band of all time! /v Guys like its not even my birthday /v 2:52 Paranoid Android...Fuck, I love this band /v I love Tom Yorke!!\nMay I have your opinion about my voice?? I'm trying to improve myself. /v Why 4:3 though? /v Portal 2 reference at 1:16 /v Thank you all /v que clipe! /v They still productive..   /v Wait what? /v https://youtu.be/9JkjupxFCe4 /v Howdy! /v What a twist /v LLOR ES HERMOSA /v Cuz I'm a creeeeeeeeeeep........   :P /v Typical Lift in Russia /v El minuto 1:52 solo veia muchas pelonas jajjaa /v Wooow ! /v Overrated band for sure. /v I suddenly wanna cry big ass ugly sobs. /v Geniaal <3 /v COOOL! /v Did anyone else catch paranoid android @ 2:53 /v \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkjupxFCe4 /v https://m.facebook.com/AmordisUK/ /v Honduras!!! /v super great video, okay song /v Blooper!?

Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda britnica estaba componiendo uno de los lbumes ms influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos dcadas despus, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedicin incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jams han visto la luz. Estas son Man of War y I Promise y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vdeoclip.\nLas imgenes de Lift estn dirigidas por el britnico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vdeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la cancin, no todo es lo que parece.\nMsica independiente novedades. /v es un video al estilo de Michel Gondry, que raro de Radiohead /v Es muy bueno!!!!!!!!! Se pasan !!!!! /v Volviendo a los 90's /v Italiani dai ci siete ? /v Hey I hope you enjoy this new video! Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support. /v What do the 7s refer to? /v As an aircraft tech, Boeing products are superior to Airbus and easier to work on, but as a passenger I much prefer the experience from Airbus. /v Hydrogen Aircraft and Electric Solar Power. The amount of time the plane sits around is probably more than enough to refuel the aircraft plus the refueling while flying. /v Lmao what about the bombardier CS300? It's not like it's negligible, 360 of those C Series have been ordered.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CSeries#Orders_and_deliveries /v hey friends please subscribe to my channel /v I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic /v 757 is my favourite aircraft to look at! Love that there was a video that focused so long on this somewhat forgotten beauty! (Icelandair flies many of them and connects many cities in North America and Europe via Reykjavik) /v So, can someone say.\nBoieng or Airbus type rate?  /v Maybe the 797 will come out with a sister plane or just a plane that comes out before/after it maybe another 757 /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v I disagree that the B757 is showing age, the 767 flew before it and it's still in high transatlantic use. Plus they're fuel efficient, so there's no need. If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable. We can't drill oil forever, it's not sustainable /v Did I just hear Hyperloop? Please head on to Thunderf00t to be reeducated /v Hyperloop doesn't work you know that right? /v Great and interesting video as normal :). /v Erm...just an FYI as someone who lives in Scotland & flys down south to Cardiff and London at least 8 times a year, flying is MUUUUCH cheaper and faster than the train. /v I'm at the level of procrastination that I'm watching someone rate airplanes /v Bombardier C-Series does all of this now and has the orders for them. Guess that's why Boeing is butthurt and putting out these videos. /v Everyone loves to complain about how uncomfortable planes are getting. Personally, I don't care. I don't ever make trans-continental flights, so sitting in an uncomfortable seat for a few hours isn't that big of a deal. And with the cost of tickets as they are I wouldn't be willing to pay more for a more comfortable experience. It's never been about the journey, just that I get there. /v Barely any airlines operate the majority of their routes with 787s tho /v People are willing to pay more for greater speed or greater comfort... if they can afford it.  Wages have been flat for nearly a generation, so it's no wonder there isn't a huge market demanding supersonic flight.\n\nWhen I went to Hawaii I paid a little extra for a non-stop flight, and I'd have been willing to pay a little extra to make the trip in four hours instead of eight (oh my aching butt!).  But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.  If and when there is a market for such things, Boeing and Airbus and others will build them. /v The problem will be this. Even with this gap filled the concern is accessibility. Because unlike train or car or bus travel you can pretty much just get on and go and not to slog through piles of security theater. So until we realize this i think the other forms will be more dominant. /v Too much talking while showing clips that have nothing to do with the subject. /v I believe the 787 was a replacement for the 767 so this would make sense /v Could you make a video about the C919, the new Chinese made airplane? /v Don't know why some commenters are pissed about Boeing.\nWhat's wrong with that manufacturer? /v When will fossil fuels run out? You make it a key part of the argument for electric power aircraft. /v By the year 2025, Boeing and Airbus will merge and create the Boebus Z5000 which will travel at 5,000 MPH. WIFI will cost $40 per MB and the cabin crew will still be old and/or gay /v it way cheaper to fly from London to Edinburgh than use the train already. /v Correction needed: The Boeing 757-200 has a range of 4500 miles in a 200 seat configuration. The video states a 4000 mile range which is typical for the 757-300, but not for the 757-200. /v Wanna hear a joke \n\n\n\n\nGalaxy Note8 - (Productivity+S Pen + Android) = iPhone X /v Would be interesting to hear your point of view on the -21. /v But, the Airbus A380 goes from Paris to LA nowadays. /v the plane of the future........ I personally think it will be one where they put you to sleep simply so they can stack you on top of other passengers and pack people up like sardines simply for a larger profit , after all you cant complaint about your flight if you dont remember it right? /v Your comments are very American and Wester European centric. The vast majority of future aircraft sales will be mostly in Asia since that's where the largest number of people live. In places like China and India which both have large populations and large surface areas, the more relevant point is one that you briefly touched on, namely the hyper loop. If that technology matures quickly, than it's far more likely that ere will be vast hyper loop networks rather than electric commuter aircraft. Also, why are you comparing aircraft with buses? They are completely on the opposite side of either an economic or technological discussion. /v I dont know how you made me watch the entire video while the topic is fucking boring as fuck, great job. /v Boeing boeing boeing...\nWill we ever even hear ONE compliment to airbus rather than praising boeing like a god. /v There are currently people talking about a possible Airbus A322 which would be a streteched A321 (more seat capacity) combined with an all new wing. This might be Airbus' answer to the MOM problem. The advantage would be a light and relatively cheap plane (compared to twin-aisle) and fleet-commonality with A319, A320 and A321 (minimizing extra-costs of sub-fleets). The disadvantage would be slower (de-)boarding, because of the single aisle and a tube-feel inside. /v Love the video! I love that you include the metric system things! /v As I'm Japanese and living in Tokyo, frequently going to Osaka to see my friend, airplane's cheaper if you book it early. The bullet train doesn't have earlt discounted ticket like most of European countries do. And, the electric airplane sounds great but Tokyo-Osaka (Itami) route, JAL and ANA use B777-200, 300 or 787-9. 777-300 is configurated with about 500 seats. It's not like London Edinburgh. Japanese domestic flights are mostly operated by twin aisle aircrafts, so electric plane is pretty much impossible in capacity way. /v The Boeing Boy is back! /v This video was made possible by iPhone X. Get your own crazy iPhone by going to Apple Store. /v Electric engines are weak??? it's a bullshit /v An airplane of the future will look like a Boeing 727-200 DAMMIT!!! /v Transparent cabin walls , are you kidding me? _yeah ppl will love that_ /v Plane of the future will consist of one pilot and a Dog. The pilot feeds the dog,while the dog will make sure you touch the correct switches. That's automation for you. /v But why dont they just use the 787 to fill in that spot? Its fuel efficient, and has more seats than a 757. /v Just got off a 11 hour flight and planes need to get WAY faster... pls /v Hyperloops will never be a real threat to planes in the future because we humans are destined to go to space, and between space and the ground there is the atmosphere, aka air, thus airplanes will be much more developped than hyperloops. /v Bio fuel not electric planes are the future! /v besides competition is coming from comac (c919) & bombardier (cs-series) for the reigional market and airbus actually has something to fill in the gap, the a330 (albeit a bit too big) , and the a320 line sort of fit this gap, the range is fine but still shorter than the 757, and the capacity falls a bit short, the neo capacity is even worse\nthe thing about the 757 is that, the range and passenger ratio is just in-line (7000km~ with 220-240 pax), so its hard to replace\npeople might say the 767 is a replacement, the 200 yeah (250-290 pax), but they're also getting old and is still a bit too large, worse - the newer models are even bigger\nalso there is the A350-800 which could be a replacement, but ppl forgot that they can carry up to 440 pax, which in low demand routes doesnt make that much sense.\nso really the airline industry needed a single aisle plane on the 240-260 pax capacity with a range of over 7000km with an impressive fuel efficiency\ngod dammit boeing and airbus, shrink your planes\n\nother consideration is a possible combi type of plane, which 250~ is reserved for pax and the rest is for cargo, i mean that, on high demand times, could generate money, both from cargo and pax and thats a win-win in my eye\n\n\nidk why but everytime even on a supposedly non bias video there is a bias from the outside perspective of\nif it aint boeing i ain going /v Electric planes?!? I believe biofuels are more likely. Not only does the technology exist, when fuel prices go up it will be able to compete with the cost. As biofuels become more used they will also drop in price. Battery technology isn't advanced enough. /v Actually, flying from Edinburgh to London is cheaper than the train (which are horrifically expensive in the UK now) - but people don't fly because the train can be quicker once you factor in airport security, waiting, etc and the fact that both airports are well outside their respective cities. People who fly tend to either be connecting in Heathrow, or live / work nearby. Working on the train is also more comfortable (a table the laptop fits on, power, wifi, decent coffee, etc for the entire journey). /v Plane of the future is No plane. This is like 100 years ago somebody predicting bullockcart of the future. /v why no ads on the video? /v Sure, planes are faster than trains - if you don't count the hour you have to be there before take-off and the travel time to the airport, which is usually out of the way and probably not even in your city (plus transit to your final destination)\n\nFor travelling from western Germany to the south it takes me a total of ~4-4.5h total travel time when using the plane and 4-5h when using the train. When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains ). /v I'm surprised they still haven't utilized birdlike designs into their planes. Why constantly blast your engines for the entire duration of the flight when you can glide on flexible wings in between sustained bursts of propulsion? /v They can't do super sonic because it damages the atmosphere /v No matter how good it is, people in the United States still have to spend more than hours in the airport at security checkpoint. /v Hyperloop will never be a thing. /v Given the rising favour of electric powered transport compaired to combustion, there will have to be either a way to provide much more electricity than there is right now, or an extreme efficiency increase for electric, which at our state are both pretty unlikely. The UK is using about 90% of its electricity reserve and further strain will be put on it with just the electric car, so it makes you wonder if the future will be able to not run out of energy as it unfolds /v I note this trend of planes spending so much time in the air that the _passengers_ are becoming increasingly interested in sleep.  Not the _crew;_ the _passengers._  I understand that planes are equipped to provide for the sleep needs of the pilot, the copilot, the navigator and the flight attendants, but what research is being done into providing for the sleep needs of _passengers?_  If we have a plane that is going to be in the air so long that there is no realistic way to ask a passenger to remain seated for the duration, and instead, it's more practical to provide them with _beds,_ can we foresee a day when this is a practical reality? /v I highly doubt electrification is achievable for flight (at anything past prototype) and even if it was it's doubtful it would be cheaper than avgas. Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the cheapest forms of dispatchable power we have. \n\nThat said, with a large nuclear power fleet, we can create synthgas from seawater, the US Navy research labs have already proven this technology (think refueling planes on an aircraft carrier). Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one. If oil price goes up synthgas will be able to make serious money with an installed fleet so large that it's not going anywhere fast. /v Electric Aircraft: no chemtrails, lol thats never gonna happen, America has to be crooked /v Hey! I have a small YouTube account and I'm struggling to take off, I'd really appreciate if you could take a look. If it's not your type of thing then you don't have to subscribe I understand but it's worth a try! /v Much like all of the future, it's extremely disappointing because what you wanted to happen is actually not allowed by the laws of physics. /v British Airways operate the A319, A320, A321 and 767 from Edinburgh to London /v Algae Biofuels can fully replace fossil fuels. Unless there's dramatic new battery technology I don't see the feasibility of electric only airplanes. Both the energy density and charging times would have to be exponentially increased. /v The energy density of jet fuel compared to batteries is around 100:1.  Until battery technology improves, this will be the major roadblock for large electric airplanes.  Lilium has a concept that might work for transporting people for shorter ranges. /v Some say that the planes of the future will already have skyscrapers attached... /v I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we cant ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least green energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft dont become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I dont think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later. /v Before watching the video I know it will be a Boeing biased one, like all of them. /v Mask on, f*ck it mask off (in the plane) /v Fuck the new iPhone, I'm hyped for the new plane /v *WARNING* EXTREME BOEING BIAS /v boeing fanboys /v nice /v whats with te 777ER /v Sponsored by Boeing /v Hyperloop lol /v Electric plane :D /v what about the 777? /v What?  No laser cannons? /v planes. /v You say Birmingham weirdly /v Poo /v Solar powered planes? /v 757 max!!! /v boring /v Airbus makes government subsidized garbage. /v Airbus wins /v Hurray for planes /v pleeaase talk about quiet supersonic transport :( /v Wendover? You could've named it Bendover  /v 0:22   **laughs at terrible pun** /v what about the 321 /v Hi there is smth called a A330-300 at 300 seats with a range of 11750km/6350nm(in the middle) and the A330-200 at 246 seats with 13,450 km/7250 nm the new ones expected to first fly sept of this year A330-800neo will have 257 seats with 13,900 km/7,500 mmi while the A330-900neo has 287 seats with a range of 12,130 km/6,550 mmi. The A319 is not the one airbus tried with but the A321 is the one now with neo(new engine option ) with 240 seats and 6,500 km / 3,500 mmi with the long range model at 7,400 km / 4,000 mmi they have sold 1,429 A321 neo aircraft as of date. /v What about A350 ??? /v Comments contain almost 100% boeing vs airbus fans war /v have you ever heard about a firm called Airbus? /v I thought the was gonna be a beautiful video with how they hear the beauty in the world. Boy was I wrong, they're all just a jerks, ugh........ /v i thought this was gonna be an uplifting video about how blind ppl care more about what's on the inside bc they can't see and therefore can't judge appearances but i guess i was wrong /v ask people who were blind from birth what they dream /v Mac is the best! /v Who's watching without eyes? /v When a blind person gets more girls than me...... /v excited to see Mac  got brought back /v Ah ah ah Take that all those but beauty is in the eye of the beholder it's the inner beauty that matters people. \n\nWe've been so much brainwashed by Hollywood beauty standards casting good looking people with zero talent who are not cinvincing on screen anyway because we can't relate to them. \nEven blind persons can see that looks matter way too much in this shallow world, and some of us have zero chance to make it and will always be disadvantaged in dating, job opportunities, social interactions, etc.\n\nI'm off to the gym to be less ugly then. /v Has someone told the first blind guy, that talked about his friend telling him he can date a fat girl and it wouldn't matter, that he himself is fit ??  /v The guy with nice hair reminds me of the twins from desperate housewives /v Preference = Shallowness ,   why can't we just like and dislike without being considered shallow, its just a preference , I personally like big butts that cannot deny.....   /v Thanks for sharing these peoples perspectives. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Up next, deaf people describe sound. /v Lmao why did I think this would be a nice deep video ...... /v ask blind men how they find the pussy /v I'm listening to Korn as I watch this.....I CAN SEE I CAN SEE I CAN SEE I'M GOING BLIND /v the only ones privileged not to see how ugly people & the human condition really are. /v Everyone so shocked that these people can be shallow they're human like just because they're blind they're not going to be looks don't matter like the fuc they're human they're going to act like human just because they can't see doesn't mean they're going to change y'all dumb as fuck /v Yooo, I just uploaded a new video with my brother! I'm pretty sure I created a new challenge so plz, it would mean heaps if you go check it out! /v I am thin............. WHAT /v If you are blind you get extra disability money! These people are smart :) /v The guy is an ass lol hahah /v Its interesting how they move their eyes as they think and blink. Why do we even blink if not to protect our eyes, why am I blinking right now. /v Omg dude in green shirt looks dead on that guy that makes fun of people who wears goth sht forget his name some u tuber /v I wish people saw beauty like that /v This is how i loose 10 kg in 15 days. This method truly works https://goo.gl/JEemx6 /v Nothing wrong with having a preference lol Everyone has a type! /v It seems like their bar for beauty is thinness... /v 3:47 I don't look at it as visual beauty... haha well no shit. I got what he meant though lol /v I guess it won't matter what your face looks like cuz they can't see it but you can feel body size, hear voice and smell body sent. /v the blind people in this video are all prettier than me.  tfw... /v the blind guy saying blind people can be shallow, bruh that's not good, also the other one who said I'm thin and i have nice hair !!WTF just being thin isn't attractive it's athletic and nice hair isn't straight and silky it could be curly /v The point is to show that it is innate no matter what, even if you can't see, that there must be a physical attraction. /v I always have a question in my head...\nDo blind people see in their dreams? /v thats not how this works /v The girl in blue just seems like she's trying to be like everyone else.....pretttyyyy lame. /v If someone is born blind how will they know how people or humans in general look like.. /v Would you rather be blind or be deaf? \n\nNo id rather have an 11 inch dick. The girls would be happy. /v Every blind person thinks black is beautiful.  /v Damn I just thought about this, blind people can't watch porn. I don't know what I'd do with all that extra time.  /v I didnt think they would just be focusing in physical beauty, but damn boy are they Shallow /v I FUCKING ADORE MAC HE IS SO CUTE WTF /v So blind folks are also judging my physical appearance. Good to know!  /v People in the comment section seriously just make me sick /v this video just strikes me as blind people are just as human as we are. they are prone to the same biases we are (human/social reinforcement of beauty). if anything, us sighted people might say that their spouse/so is beautiful because we think a blind person should have very low visual standards - yet they want something that they perceive to be beautiful just like many of us consider a van gogh piece beautiful (or yeezy shoes lmao) - just because they are desired by others. f*** what others say...maybe we need to know the real reason we as individuals find something to be beautiful. and maybe we have no idea what its like to be blind in a sighted people's existence. maybe there are things that we cannot see but still discriminate against anyways. i hope somebody reads this and understands what i mean cuz some of these comments really suck. /v i find mac really hot  /v I learned that blind people have huge egos unless you are black, that dude didnt have an ego /v I've been really trying not to say nothing but why the black dude glasses not on his ears?\n\n\n\n\n\n Like they so tight on his head that it doesn't need to be held up like that....ok I'ma stop talking. /v 3:13 but no , she's mine! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo \nCute /v Mac is a cutie /v Lol bruhh so what does it matter if soft haired guy has a hot wife. He can't enjoy her looks  /v Let me be the first to say these blind people are ugly as fuck /v How can someone dislike this video?? I thought it was lit!!! /v they seem more shallow than most people who can see! LOL I thought they would be a little bit more poetic lol /v So cute, im crying in da club /v Wow the blind chick wasn't lying when she said she was a shallow fuck /v The shallow girl is not pretty enough to be shallow. No wonder she is single /v The black guy be like I might be blind but at least I ain't black\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssa joke /v First time watching but does Mac remind anyone else of Spencer from Criminal Minds lol /v Blind, deaf, etc. We're still all PEOPLE! /v Hi my name is Jason and I'm blind because I have something in my eye and it's annoying /v Did you ask the turtle to describe flying too? /v Yo which one is daredevil /v Alas our society is super vain when we're literally asking blind people how they know if someone is hot looking! /v What is it like not being able to see, like, I've lived my whole life being able to see, what would it feel like or be like to suddenly not see? /v Bump bump bump two bumps and a bump. /v I don't care I hope others don't this is dumb it's saying see blind people have standards fucking everyone does bitch everyone /v I cant fucking imagine not seeing EVER i really feel bad for her /v I think you guys should have kids talk to someone with body dysmorphia /v Bottom line: People perceive beauty by two things\n1. How it affects them emotionally with what their own senses can connect to (i.e. make they feel nice and find to be pleasing).\n2. From other people's perceptions and opinions.\n\nBut naturally unless you do a serious analysis on your understanding of a subject you would just have a vague unclear notion on it. /v This makes me so sad. I can't wait for the day when technology progresses enough that it allows these people to see. /v What I learned... Blind people are shitty just like regular people ohhh big shock. /v So beauty is skin deep and determined by the feeling of their hair and the shape and size of their body even to blind people got it /v when is fear pong actually going on sale /v 1:05 her eyes are just rolling around  /v Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the true eye that sees beauty is the heart. /v Mac is gorgeous  /v I loved it... /v Not bad /v Yeah this video sucks /v Iherb discount coupon \nSEF8620 /v Thanks for that ;-) /v Well....The end was nice. /v Squaaaaaaaa - fetty wap /v  /v Beauty is dark lol /v Mac /v That was lovely :):) /v Mac potts /v I would totally date the blind girl! /v Anybody calling these blind people shallow need to rethink themselves. There always need to be some level of physical attractieness in a relationship. I find someone being shallow if they only like a person for only one aspect of them and nothing else. And theres nothing wrong with liking thin people. Ever heard of preferences? /v This video was so pathetic to say the least!!! /v I LOVE THE GIRL IN BLUE KEEPING IT REAL! YASS! To everyone crying about how this was disappointing because it wasn't disability inspiration porn enough for them, sorry to burst your bubble, but people with disabilities are just that... people. At the end of the day they are just as shallow as you or me and 98% of the rest of the population. Don't cry because they are being honest, be grateful they aren't lying out their ass like people usually seem so inclined to do these days. /v Just sad how shallow the world is... smh it even affects people who cant see it /v That's not how you pronounce my name. /v I wish they'd talk about beauty in general (flowers, rain, breezes, etc.) rather than what sighted people consider 'hot'. All the depth of a Kardashian conversation. /v He protec\n\nHe attac\n\nBut most importantly:\n\nHis name Macc /v :51 he's tall, slender, nice hair, cute, plus he seems nice. just my type  /v I bet that chick thinks she's super hot. /v This is a great interview for people to watch to see how easily people can lie and manipulate. She lies effortlessly. /v what I think: *This video is too damn loo0o0Oongg!* /v Who cares what she thinks?\nBesides, we already know.\nSHE ONLY THINKS ABOUT HERSELF!\n*PLEASE* Stop giving this woman a soapbox before it breaks under the weight of her corruption and she hurts herself. /v what she's thinking is doesn't matter..what's going on..its real point right now.. /v It should say What A Narcissist Really Thinks /v An unending stream of consciousness with no rational point, no rational anything, and absolutely no self awareness. /v Trying to act like she was Bernie all along. /v Wow \nWHAT A LIAR!!!!! \nHow anyone can believe this witch baffles me /v Why didn't you ask her about all the crooked stuff they were doing at DNC? Why was Debbie Wasserman fired? Why isn't she against the super delegates? Because she benefits from it. Why didn't you ask her why she failed to show up in key states? Why was she stumbling all over the place? Why did she make so many millions off wallstreet and expect everyone to say that's OK? So much you should of asked her. You just sat there pandering to that stupid woman. /v IT WASN'T ME Her entire book summed up. /v I want to be at Hillary's party on Trump's impeachment night. Oh and Trumpanzees, it's a WHEN not an IF :) /v Whether or not you like Clinton, she does know what she is talking about and she is a very smart woman. You might not agree with her opinions and political points, but she is a very admirable woman regarding her knowledge. /v You had no message lady not to mention you are a lying,corrupt, murdering establishment Hack! You are an embarrassment to all women. Shapshifter..... /v Hillary is just a typical feminist. She doesn't want to accept responsibility and she thinks she's entitled to everything just because she's a woman. People just didn't want her and the age of feminism is over. /v If you want to know what Hillary Clinton really thinks, you can't ask her in person. Everything she says is a lie. This interview is pointless fluff. /v Notbing but softball questions from commrade vox. What a joke. /v People forget one little MAJOR thing. The Democrats are the ones who wanted slavery. They were the party of the kkk. They were the Confederates. /v 38:00 ..........No Hillary everyone just wanted ANYONE other than you. After you threw Bernie to the wolves a ton of his supporters could not stomach voting for you. I would say I lean right politically but even i would of voted Bernie rather than have Trump or Hillary. /v anyone regretting not supporting Bernie or Johnson now? /v Why is she around still?!?!!?! She lost to a cheeto face! She is a disgrace. /v I couldn't vote for her or Trump. It sucks having a conscience AND reasoning skills.... /v -- Ezra Klein (3:14) Do you think that one of the lessons of watching Bernie Sanders, of watching Donald Trump, is that perhaps the correct role for policy in a campaign is to inspire? And that the place for technocratically sound, more pragmatic policy is in the legislative process? -- American politics centers on emotion, on charisma, on sensationalism. But it shouldn't. Voters shouldn't care about the color of a politician's toupee or pantsuit. What matters is process and, even more so, results, and the person (or, rather, team of people) managing that political process shouldn't be determined by a popularity contest. Without substantial electoral reform, voting directly for President of the United States will always, for most of the electorate, be tantamount to voting for a high school prom king. /v This woman is a true a president. /v Am I the only one that voted trump? /v Why is media even covering this disgusting woman anymore? /v Who cares what that idiot thinks /v She says the right is anti-immigrant. Lies, we are anti ILLEGAL immigrant. People are dumb to buy her book. she's already a multi millionaire. Want to make millions, became an identity politics politician. /v Trump sucks .. ha ha you think Hillary is any better you moron! Hillary sucks .. ha ha you think Trump is any better you moron! /v Haha the failure wrote a book solely blaming other people for her losing: Bernie Sanders, James Comey, etc /v She should be blaming herself and her shitty decisions not to mention her horrid campaign no1 trusted her or the string bean standing next to her /v I thought that this was a great piece. Regardless of what people may think about Hillary, she is undeniably eloquent and oh-so intelligent. You can really hear the thought and depth in her responses. They were actual, solid answers to his questions. Never once did she say: You're gonna be very happy with this interview. Lol /v One year after the fact, and its amazing how much visceral hatred for Hillary still remains, and the extent to which it colours popular perception. She's written a book exploring what happened, which, no matter how you slice it, will mean looking at the reasons why she lost. Being able to reflect on that experience, mistakes and all - and learn from it is pretty important for anyone to be able to do. You won't get far in life if you can't do this. But slather this with kneejerk hatred and it suddenly becomes entirely a blame game! \n\nI mean, it takes a deep plunge into the the pit of 'alternative facts' to be able to watch this interview and come away with the conclusion that Hillary is simply doling out blame. And yet, here we are.\n\nI say this as an international observer - someone who hasn't been caught up with the hyper-partisanship and tribalism that is clearly afflicting many Americans - you guys need to take a step back and have a good look at yourselves and what you're becoming. What you've already become. When you can't tell fact from fiction at the most basic levels - when your prejudices are affecting your judgement to this extent, something has gone seriously wrong. And as alarming as this is - and it should be alarming to just about everyone - it appears like a huge segment of both media and laypeople (as evidenced in the comment section here) alike are clearly more interested in indulging in their hatred and self satisfied criticism, than giving any thought to the content of the discussion. /v please run hillary so we can get another 4 years of trump /v Giving Hillary airtime and mindshare instead of Bernie, when the former is busy profiting from book sales and interviews and the latter is attempting to introduce Universal Health Care and actively fighting Trump. smdh /v It takes an hour to say everyone's fault but mine? /v Hate her all you want guys, but you have to admit, wouldn't it be nice to have a president who's actually informed and can converse intelligently on actual issues? /v Man listening to center-right corporate dems is like sitting through that annual PowerPoint presentation at work that no one wants to attend...can they all just be absorbed into the republicans already and we start a New Left? /v Why does Vox care what she thinks, she was the most corrupt politician in recent history and lost to Donald Trump /v I still don't understand how people POSSIBLY think she's worse than Trump. /v hilary clintons democratic opponent bernie is still in government still fighting for what he believes is right, healthcare for all and free college, compared to hilary, who wrote a book about how bernie was the reason she lost.... /v Can you own so much turquois? /v What voter suppression is going on? Requiring an ID to vote makes it to where it is harder to cheat in elections. Election and voter fraud are a real thing. What is so racist about requiring an ID to vote? /v Both her and Trump are in the same poo filled bag. #liarliarpantsonfire #goaway /v Instead of Secretary Clinton he should've said Not President Ms Clinton /v Hillary Clinton wants to tell you 'What Happened' ... MH17 = MH370 = lord Watt illuminati agent getting cloned and send back to CIA EU , he loved that russian lady`s so much . /v Thank God we did not elect this witch. /v One of Hillary's problems is that her positions on issues may have seemed more grounded, by they also didn't solve the problem. For example: When Sanders talked about public college being free (through a regulatory measure, similar to what is done in the UK), Hillary's proposal was tuition free college in which tax credits would be given to help subsidize the cost of college, but only for families below a certain income bracket. So you have tax money being used for college credits for certain people, which does nothing to actually curb the out-of-control costs of college education. All it does is give colleges an excuse to increase their tuition rates because now, the money would be coming from the government instead of students. \n\nAnother example: Universal Healthcare. Hillary said, 90% of people are covered, so it's easier to just get the other 10%. Maybe. But the 90% don't all have good, or affordable coverage. They're just covered. The plan of extending Obamacare further doesn't do anything to actually curb the out-of-control costs of healthcare, because her plan continued to see cooperation with the money-sucking insurance companies. See? There's a pattern here. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Okay, but in all seriousness, she's still a politician, putting a camera and microphone on her is a pretty surefire way to not get her true thoughts out. /v What did she accomplish again? /v This was very good! Thoughtful and thorough! Nice I liked it! Good job!  /v The world dodged the biggest bullet with this woman /v I actually really enjoyed this interview it really showed a human side of Hillary when so many people make her seem like a demon. I only wish it was conducted from a jail cell with shackles at her feet because she is a failed stateswoman that got nothing done and is a criminal against this nation and the rule of law. /v You know you're a fail when you lose to a commie and trump #maga /v Go away Hillary, we're just not into you... /v Thank God this venal, mendacious, self-absorbed woman did not become president. /v 32:30 Thank you for pushing back on her assertion that donations *didn't* affect how Obama governed. Who was bailed out? Who was in his cabinet? /v You can tell Ezra Klein has a past in sports, when he asks softball questions like this /v I voted for her but I still believe she is a flip flopping politician who owed to many people loyalty to make a truly good president. /v Where was this Hillary during the elections? I didn't see her like this!!! What a shame... /v The irony as she rambles on one of the many, MANY leftist pushing media outlets about the right controlling the media. /v it's sad that the election candidates came to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are corrupt liars the best America has to choose from? oh wait, that is what politics in general has become /v I want this lady to come back next election and come back stronger. /v She should have done universal basic income, universal healthcare, and other socialism. Then the far right and far left would've had a better meme war. Centrists are boring.\n It I guess what she is saying is that some of that isn't practical, and she wouldn't have been able to explain how it would get done? /v Who else wishes she spoke clearly like this during the election itself? /v the only thing Hillary did wrong was be too polite /v yeah, attack the media, obama, joe biden, bernie but not you. gj hillary, classic female. /v I actually really enjoyed this interview. /v I definitely think Hillary Clinton's viewpoint that the American people care about details, analyses, facts, and legislative precision was inaccurate. A large portion of both the primaries and the general election *is* a personality contest, whether we like to admit it or not. You need to learn to appeal to different crowds while still maintaining a focus on your agenda items.\n\nIt wasn't that Hillary didn't have that focus - I think she expended far too much energy in maintaining it, and not enough on figuring out what crowds wanted, or how to tailor her speeches so that both laypeople and those in-the-know would get a sense of who she was as a person and leader.\n\nThe end result of the loss can be blamed on the timing of a variety of events and the presence of a variety of scandals, real or imagined, but a large part of the responsibility lies with how she chose to run a data-centric, cold-and-clinical campaign. I hope future leaders learn from her missteps.\n\nAs for her commentary on Obama and her husband...I don't think they ran anywhere near as clinically as she believes. I do think they were more capable of being a visionary, of matching personalities with their opponents. /v Here's the Bernie Sanders convo from 1 year that Vox did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5vOKKMipSA. Still waiting on Trump's one /v Hillary isn't too mad about what happened in the end, because deep down she knows she won and that Kobach et al stole it for the Republicans. Even Trump didn't even expect to win. /v Number one on the agenda, for both the Democratic and Republican parties, should be to slow down the death-spiral of rising healthcare costs.\n\nNo plan, not Obamacare nor a Trumpcare plan will ever be feasible if these prices outpace GDP growth. /v I gave the Clinton Foundation a million dollars and all I got for it was her book. I hate it when I don't get the correct change back. /v **Vox is Liberal Propaganda** HILLARY FOR PRISON! 1 LIKE ON THIS COMMENT EQUALS 1 VOTE FOR HER TO GO TO PRISON!! /v HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH /v I am Chinese.And i like the honest one.DONALD TRUMP did a great job.though he always makes mistakes in midea eyes.He is on the right way.At least i think so. /v I'm a simple man. I see Hillary's face, I drop a dislike and leave. /v I wonder if McCain and Romney would have gotten this much attention if they had written a why I lost book. Wait, they have class so they wouldn't have published a book in the first place /v Hillary saying democrats don't control the media. Lol! Yes, democrats control the mainstream media but nobody believes or takes them seriously anymore. /v Pathetic piece by loser Ezra. She's a corrupt corporate Democrat willing to trample on progressives to further her right-wing agenda. She's pro-war, oil, and pharma. What's the point of this interview? She's already pointed the finger at everyone else for her embarrassing loss. Stop giving her airtime and Ezra- grow a pair and stop being a wide eyed fanboy /v She has a public and a private belief system.

This storm was a monster, but we're only focused on what it did to one place and not the rest. /v Boohoo shpw the Caribbean. It's gone. Not all this happy white suburban homes without roofs. People in st marteen don't have roofs anymore either... OR HOMES /v So where are the fly overs of Bermuda? /v Hi! Check out my channel for tv reviews and recommendations. Thanks :D /v I am so sick of people saying not that bad,not everyone is rich or can afford to rebuild. /v Try to use appropriate adjectives to describe events rather than over exaggerating to get views like a below average YouTube editor.... /v It wasn't that bad in parts of Florida ,but it hit the Carribean horribly /v a horrible attempt to try and get us to freak out /v You know, spotlight should be shown where the hurricane was actually catastrophic: down in the Island Nations. Place where there is no more infrastructure anymore. Where people can't find food anymore because of the hurricane. Not where someone's boat is half sunken or a roof was torn off and that's it. /v So some trailers were missing some roofs and that's it? Wheres the flattened buildings or flooded city streets? /v Why are they only showing mobile homes?\nAren't they less likely to go through a big storm like this? /v This isnt bad at all... if you wanna see bad then look at the Caribbean islands where it looks like Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. /v From the air USA Today posts fake news. /v That was not shit /v I don't see how you can call it not bad when millions of people are without power and they are not going to have food or gasoline for a long time without having to resort to emergency support. Many of the homes are not going to be able to be rebuilt for years if at all and the property will be sold to the highest bidder and they will not rent to these people who are not able to live in their homes now. Supplies go to the richest people who can afford to rebuild and or live somewhere else while they are waiting for their homes. They are going to be waiting for insurance for homes, cars and boats. They are not going to be working for quite a while now. They are not going to be ok in a week. Many have no air conditioning now in the heat. This was not a weak . There are sick, elderly and disabled people trying to manage right now and figure out how to get by with the devestation. Weak , I don't think so /v Wouldn't call this catastrophic /v All those Mullets.  Oh the horror.  The horror. /v Trailer park videos! Really? That's normal. /v It's not that bad /v Lool. If you call this bad then that's nothing. Seriously these look right next to the ocean too. Trailer park looked decent. Did you plan the before and after, common? You can't call this catastrophic /v They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep /v *BUT DID IT DESTROY A GAMING CHAIR* /v this is one of the worst videos I've ever seen /v why is it all mobile homes on cement slabs and tin roof panel houses? of course these types of structures would break easy. /v Lol!!! A few cardboard box houses were blown away.... devastating /v First off. This was sad in comparison to Andrew. Second, WHO FILMS DRONE SHOTS IN 1x1?! It looks terrible. /v They gassed this hurricane up like it was bouta be the end of florida. The News Hyping it up like florida wasnt going to be on the map anymore /v lmfao at anyone who thought this was actually gonna devastate anything. Florida experiences hurricanes quite frequently. As a result, most houses are built to last through a hurricane of substantial power. The media definitely overplayed this one lol /v Has everyone forgot bout hurricane Harvey victims and are worried bout just Florida....? /v Catastrophic? Sit down. /v We don't care about mobile homes. Show us more of regular houses, that's what's interesting because everyone knows a mobile home can't hold up to a hurricane. /v Remember to pay your climate change dues so this shit won't happen anymore. /v When you get click-baited by the news  /v bahahaha what's with all that saturation with before irma show us the real pics and don't make it too exaggerated yeesh /v Its nit that bad from what i see /v It was a CAT 3 at landfall and quickly weakened soon after made worse only by the fact that many a moron live in aluminum boxes. Are those things even anchored beyond electric & gas connectors? /v Looks like a trailer park in texas after a small tornado. /v Had to stop it 5 seconds in because of the music. Fail /v Stop making houses out of cardboard /v We will rebuild we always do...LOVE TEXAS & FLORIDA  /v Never thought people would argue over who's city got destroyed the most. /v OH MY GOD!!! THE WORST STORM EVER SLIGHTLY DAMAGED SOME PROPERTIES! CALL FEMA! \n\nWhat is Florida's death toll again? /v Hurricane Andrew literally flattened entire suburbs. This is far far from a catastrophe. /v It really wasn't as bad as it could be. /v And the wolf went to the fourth little pig, who made his mobile home out of cheap materials and paper mache ....... /v Irma kicked the shit out of those trailer parks. /v It's almost like Andrew. /v For a category 3 hurricane it's pretty okay /v Lmfao people are disappointed that is wasn't worse wtf is wrong with you people /v media trying to stir up more fear /v Make your houses out of stone you will feel like nothing ever happened /v I don't believe it /v Trump is in trouble, he has to donate 2 million dollars now. He's going to be broke /v Woow! So much for catastrophic damages. Even the trailer parks are still standing!  /v Whats with the horrible music? tf /v Other then some property damage and laying tress, irma did nothing /v Thank you God that I did not get hit and my family in Florida is fine. God bless all the people that got hit. I wish the best for you /v  Thumbs up if you were expecting a creepy clown with this music.    /v Building codes in Florida should make structure more wind resistant. But to me it looks corners were cute. And i cant feel sorry for people live in mobil homes next to the shore in hurricane alley (Florida). Thats just stupid. /v Really f#ck these square video's. Smartphone manufacturers: Here's bigger screen with higher resolution than ever! Facebook: Here is a square compressed to death video! Enjoy!  /v I've lived in Florida- Miami, Melbourne, & Jacksonville- and the strangest universal truth becomes obvious after hurricanes: there are a LOT of trailer parks in Florida on some very high-dollar property. And even stranger is that these people will all rebuild in the same place, over and over again. It never ceases to amaze me that someone would want to live in such a flimsy homes knowing that they're going to see severe storms every few years. /v what about mexico and cuba? /v i dont think it caused a lot of damage. /v Houston got it bad, Florida came out not that bad /v This is like a picnic in the park with Elmo. Anybody see damage in the Caribbean, Cuba, and the FL Keys. /v THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.  COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE. /v Y'all acting like Irma didn't hit the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Smh. It did damage plenty and it may not have damaged Florida on a massive scale but thank goodness for that. /v Show the carribeans! That's real catastrophe! /v They hyped this storm up to be absolutely devastating when it hit Florida but it was no where near that...smh /v Meanwhile Barbuda got wiped off the planet .... /v I like how they're only covering Florida but not the Carribean that got fucked by the strongest hurricane to be ever formed in the Atlantic at its strongest point (190 MPH Winds and 225 MPH Gusts) that even caused places like Barbuda to be Inhabitable (meaning you're not allowed to live there anymore) which the entirety of that island got 95-100% destroyed. And the dozens that also died throughout there. They didn't even cover Puerto Rico, which the US owns. Like shit... /v Irma: It's over! I have the high ground! /v Why not just go to the islands that actually got hit with cat 5 winds /v Irma wasn't that bad.. /v Quit overhyping it. Andrew was worse. /v https://youtu.be/wJBBlntDtEU /v Overhyped /v THATS NOTHING, DENIED! /v lol nothing /v this has to be the most clickbait fraudulent claim of destruction I've ever seen. small tornadoes will do 10x the amount of damage this did. who's agenda are you fulfilling usa today??? /v what overhyped bullshit /v Trump is a Cat 5 dumbass. /v gofundme.com/dragonmother /v Maybe its catastrophic because its a goddamn trailerpark /v Sarasota gets hit by Irma.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YedAWzqUxg&t=6s /v Harvey was 10 times worse /v My room looks worse /v skip ad\ni need a doughnut /v Nah.. Just a drizzle /v Irma was overhyped /v Follow my Vlog bad boy /v FAKE NEWS!! /v Nice clickbait /v http://www.eaymusic.com/forum.php?x=68155 /v Clickbait... /v Lol. /v This'll prove the Irma deniers wrong /v What the f ever, Harvey caused way worse deatruction... florida lost sum shingles and couple boats so fuckin what /v So a few shingles missing is devistation?  Then Harvey must have been apocoltptic. /v Love this look on you boo!! Gorgeous as always! /v Your face looks fake. /v Gorgeous!

Lets hope he never gets on the same bus with Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves. /v Give it a rest. /v lol just dont take the money and movie is over and happy ending.... /v Looks like the guy from Non Stop got cleaned up and had a couple of kids and then....got himself in to some similar mess. Liam Neeson just can't catch a break... /v Maybe this is the best trailer of this year. Let's hope the movie is as good. /v Couldn't happen in the UK. If you tried to start a conversation with a stranger, they'd look at you like you're insane and slowly edge away. /v I love Qui-Gon Jinn, but ole soy sauce head is like 78. Isn't he getting too old for action movies. /v liam neeson kills people on a train the movie /v Okay so obviously this takes place after they have kidnapped his daughter then his wife. As you can see because this must be his second marriage. Where I'm confused though, does this take place before working for the Irish Mob and working in Alaska or after?? /v First he was set up in a plane, now in a train, so next should be a boat or did I miss that one XD /v If i was Liam i would GTFO of there. /v And here I was thinking she just wanted to bang him.... /v if its liam neeson i always accept /v Surprised that nobody got taken in this trailer.... /v finally some old school action thriller !! /v if Vera is here where's Patrick huh? /v I'm still excited as long Liam Nesson on the movie, even this movie looks like a Non-Stop /v From the director of The Shallows and Non-Stop.\n\nSOLD  /v What is up with Liam Neeson with CellPhones and setting up stuff. /v The real cliffhanger here is.. will Liam Neesons fight wolves with bare hands in this one? /v Can someone explain that ? Is that copy of None Stop or sequel of None Stop ? /v I don't know who you are, but i will find you, and i will kill you Lorraine Warren! /v Did anyone notice the Terminator tune at 01:19? /v About bloody time. I've been waiting for this trailer since the movie was announced nearly a year ago. /v Another film about Liam Neeson having problems with public transport. He should learn to drive. /v They need to do a Liam Neeson movie that doesn't have Liam Neeson in it /v WOAH WOAH.....Tommen? In modern? I'm probably on that weird side of youtube again? /v So he kills again? /v didn't he already do this on a plane? /v At the end of the movie his alarm goes off and he wakes up the end /v wow a trailer that doesn't give away the whole movie! /v This could be either really good or really bad.. /v Didn't he say he was done with these type of movies? Old people forget so quickly. /v Liam neeson should just stop using public transports /v I will find you and I will take that money and run /v now he's on a train /v The girl was not even pretty so i will just say meh. /v January Come Already!!!! Liam Neeson is the best!!! :D /v This time Liam gets Taken. /v I reacted to this trailer on my channel it's pretty good /v HELLO COMMUTERS. With your computers, /v I'm moving seats, don't speak crazy /v I know who you are! once I get off from this train. I'll find you and kill you. /v Liam Neeson be like -\nI don't know who you are,\nI don't know what you want\nIf you are looking for ransom, I have the money this time \nBut I can tell you this That I don't have a very particular set of skills this time too\nBut still, I can give nightmares to people like you\nIf you let me go now freely, that'll be the end of it, I will not look for you\nBut if You don't then I will FIND YOU AND I WILL KILL YOU! /v Geez how long is his commute?? /v He could have just taken an Uber. /v You can't go wrong with Liam Neeson. /v It's gonna be intense /v Literally every Liam Neeson movie is him getting interrupted during his morning commute /v Wow.. /v Source Code 2: Taken /v Norma isnt dead!!!! L /v 13 Sins? /v Taken in conjuring /v Kinda reminds me of Source Code /v Yay Norma lives!!  /v Non - stop part 2! /v Non stop : train edition /v He looks tinner /v The Taken Commuter. /v excellent trailer /v Rainy day thriller /v Non-Stop 2 /v Liam Neeson in: That escalated quickly /v loooool yep he owns this genre now. /v Woa hdude they do trailers 6 months before movies come out now? /v the commutaken /v taken /v Here comes the Taken jokes XDDD /v looks great /v Wow! This looks really good. /v GOOD LUCK /v This looks oddly familiar  /v gay. didnt even watch it /v We have the MCU, we have the DCEU and we have the LNU ( Liam Neeson Universe ).  I can't wait to see this one.\n\nThey even got the girl from The Conjuring Universe. /v i almost thought than this is his non-stop sequel  ...... /v This is pretty much just another Source Code movie /v This is his last movie. Will definitely watch it. /v Yeah.. I'll watch anything that Liam Neeson is in. /v The king of action thriller is back baby!  /v Don't trust Norma Bates. /v i love lim nison /v I see Liam, I upvote! /v NOOOOOORRRRMANNNN! /v This is gonna be good /v Who will rescue the rescuer? /v Pretty sure she's the person on the train out of place /v That's how the trailers of good movies should be presented . /v So it's Given now... /v Liam should play Reed Richard aka mr fantastic /v Thought it said computer also, why didn't that chick get more naked in The Departed :( /v Now this is a good trailer and not a trailer which shows the full plot. /v Taken in the train /v zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz /v is all right /v 0:16   *KING TOMMEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* /v i loveeeeeeeeeeeee  Liam Neeson /v The amount of likes this comment gets is the amount of days I won't use my phone (wish me luck ). /v I'm watching this video on my phone  /v 415 people are unable to accept the truth of their reality. /v You're pathetic if u can't go a few days w/o a phone /v I don't use my phone to run away from myself, I use it so I don't have to interact with others lol /v Very nice message & some awesome animation & narration to go a long with it. Yeah this is a topic I think about a lot. In fact I made a little satire series called Strange Stories to kind of poke fun at how we function with all this advanced technology now. /v I love that this is posted on the day iPhone X's premiere was released. XD /v Enjoy your freedom of thought before our phones literally become a part of us. I can see it now, silent obedience with just the snap of a finger. /v Well I wouldn't have seen this without my phone just saying  /v You say that like it's a bad thing... \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v I'm so obsessed with my phone lol /v looks like the eraser head baby all grown up at 2:05 /v The problem with your phone is it's an iPhone /v Soooo.... what your saying is....\n\n\n\n\nwho is getting the iPhone X? :D /v Is it just me or was that thought super cute /v I stay on my phone when I'm bored then they mobile is invented to make me unbored in home if that's a word  /v The problem with our phones: It gained intelligence but we lost ourselves. /v I have no friends /v Aha! Releasing this on the same day the iPhone X/8 were announced? You dogs! /v this is an amazing video, the animation is great and you actually say some interesting things.\n\nmemento mori /v problem isn't with phones but with ourselves. \nlike hello....move your ass a little around!! /v We spend too much time with our phones, why we should talk to other people in real life, if we could spent our whole life to stare on our phone? (I'm guilty too in this case, so please don't judge me!) ^^ /v capitalism and materialism are the problems /v My break from my phone is photography... granted, I listen to music via my phone, but at least I'm not still staring at it... and fuck off if you say my cameras a screen, I spend much more time looking around and through the view finder than at the screen /v why did this video take such a dark turn... didnt expect a video about phones to be so morbid /v can you the same things for books, youtube, knowledgable video ? plz explain . . . where the scattered knowledge come from . . . what is the right path to become knowledgable without addiction /v I think in the future we will(or should) have classes in school that teach kids the pitfalls of technology and how to stay balanced with one's self in the information age.\nI for one make an active effort to keep balance in my life, even though I love technology and actually work with computers and phones(or maybe because of it). But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy. /v 3:52 I bet you my life you didn't notice that double and in the translation.  /v Anyone ever been to Lyon here ?! :) /v I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple.. /v That was a load of pseudo-intellectual babble.. Far below the standards I've gotten to used to expecting from this channel. \nShame. /v i managed to watch 1/3 of this before checking my email /v This video sounds warm and believable, but in fact, it is wrong.\n\nBecause the problem is not with our phones, instead, it's with us.\n\nIt is like saying the problem with knifes: then, you say that it kill. While it does not kill, but it can be used to kill, also, it can be used for many purposes. /v Oh the irony since I'm watching this on my phone, probably more than 2/3rds or the comment section. /v 1:10 - Scary how this described my current problem at the moment. /v Tl;dr: get off your phone because it's apparently blocking us from some kind of utopian future even though most of you are watching this on your phone\n\n\n\nI don't get it /v I'm having a hard time putting my finger on this one but something about the videos produced by these guys rubs me the wrong but I can not seem to articulate it. But, I am getting the sense that I'm being preached to and I feel that many of the ideas that are being asserted should be debated. Perhaps that is the point of the videos..... at least I hope that is. /v Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access. Or it can be used as a crutch where you can't even think for yourself and rely on social media as a way to feel apart of something. We can't blame the corporations for profiting off the ignorance of the masses, thats just how human nature is. Its the job of people to elevate their own consciousness to become self aware enough to determine a life they want to live. /v Watching this sitting on the toilet taking a dump and reading the comments. :O /v I don't see anything wrong with that. And I watching this video with my phone. Knowledge is the biggest enemy of the scammers /v Same thing as blaming the gun for the murder.  The phone isn't the problem, you are.  If you decide to use your phone to look at pornography all day, that's your choice.  If you decide to use your phone to connect with your grandmother thousands of miles away, that's your choice.  If you can't learn to use the tool you have in your pocket in moderation, that's your choice. /v Good thing I'm using my phone to ignore everything in general. /v Battery life is the problem /v Irony of watching this video in a phone..! /v I do not own a phone. I was asked what the time was once, by this human girl person, and I said; I don't know, because I didn't know. The human girl person asked me if I didn't have a phone on me. I said no, because I didn't. She glared at me like I was personally insulting her by trying to fool her into thinking I had no phone.\n But yeah, I guess I can understand her mistrust...everyone nowadays has a phone... /v Bull\n5h17\nGo back to your secluded farm. In a way, I think it's more exciting to actually run a farm than playing FarmVille. Just be kind with the piglets. /v I have my phone on me but rarely get a call. Or text. Somewhat feel I need it on me but on occasions I leave behind.  I want technology to aid my life, get something from it rather than pointless time wasting. /v Listen to Arcade Fire's Everything Now album. We're addicted to this instant gratification our phones provide us. The more readily available something is, the less we value it. It's a dangerous game, and I think people need to wake up soon. /v 42 second's in Nope this doesn't apply to me at all, I can quite happily live without my phone, its only use is to keep family/friends in contact other than that its not important to me, So nice generalizations at the start of the video /v phone is like a kitchen knife, we can use for cooking or we can use for murder someone, the first thing we should to know is understanding about a phone itself and ourselves. /v To be honest I use my phone as something to express my thoughts, to develop my thoughts and to have a better understanding of things. /v This video dosen't make any sense. I use my phone all the time, and I've never felt anything u've told in this video. /v This video is nonsense /v Rambles on about how we use our phone too much or incorrectly, only to sell us a link at the end of the video. Wat /v I'm glad i grew up in the 90's without smart phones, and today I use my phone to answer, make calls and check my voicemail. /v with or without a phone I will spend all my free time indoors masturbating. /v school of life can we have more philosophy videos please? my life is disappointingly empty without them. /v They don''t keep a charge for more than 2 hours. Thats the problem with our phones. /v This guy's voice haha what the fuck /v I like the critique of smart-phones, but found this imagined future technology worse. Let's admit now what the ancient Greeks knew and told in their myths (and here we can include too the ancient Indians, Chinese and Japanese who knew and told likewise): often technologies and machines are just bad. /v I got rid of my social media and cut my cable off but now I just watch youtube constantly. I have to get a hobby or more of a social life so I can cut it out all together. /v Everybody laughed at the fat people from Wall-E. But that will be us soon. /v If I were you I'd change my phone, because I live in Lima, Per and you got the population wrong /v if you're at the edge of the grand canyon or by the matterhorn you're not gonna have service. so no i won't be postmating food to the matterhorn /v Oh my how profound very intelligent /v I turn this video on to do to sleep listening to something so my mind doesn't wander for hours |:-) /v I don't see how this is a new problem, my grandma used to go to a library to find information instead of consulting ourselves /v In the Utopia - and that's when I checked out.\nWhat's more likely to happen?  Maybe a big tech corporatocracy.  Maybe a singularity gone horribly wrong.  Maybe a cyber cold war not just between opposing nations but between security and privacy.  Maybe, if George Carlin is right, the planet will shake us off like fleas.  But no matter how smart technology gets, it will only ever be a tool, not a guardian angel. /v Wow, that was a lot of big english words. /v seems to have some self evident truths but ultimately pseudoscience /v Who else doesn't give 1 shit /v The problem is that government has regulated everything....so free thinking is discouraged by the state. You will and you can be arrest for thinking beyond what the government allows.... /v We stand in the shoulders of giants... And through my phone and the information age I can see everywhere... I am an introvert who hates small talk, my world has grown significantly... Its not your phone, but how you use it... Ironically I used my phone to watch this video... /v I have been working on trying to stay away from my phone for useless things and trying to focus and be more productive. Self-awareness and being present are two of the most crucial elements of humanity that we need to start practising once again. Btw, this is quite possibly one of the most wonderful videos I've watched and the writing is remarkable!! /v Well I just realized this few days ago, I'm someone who spends A Lot of time on phone, and it's kind of scary that no matter how much time I spend, I'll never be able to watch all the watch laters or getting information about the subject I want because it is infinite, humans tend to look for happiness and phone help us get rid of sadness or in forgetting sadness, but I certainly realized I'm not talking to myself and it really bother me so I'm trying but certainly we need something more advanced because now you can get so much information with the phone that we can never review it. /v Open up a patreon.com /v Dat tongue at 4:05 /v capitalists /v Lel I use my phone cuz I'm bored /v Delete them unnecessary applications  /v Nice /v . /v ... this is absolutely ignorant. /v PC MASTER RACE, CONSOLES FOR PEASANTS, SMARTPHONES FOR BEGGARS /v What about computers?! /v Not me, pssh. /v Subtitles In Spanish Please /v Eat shit! /v iphone10 /v Truuuuu /v fuck yo capitalism /v Ya I don't think phones r that big of a deal. I don't use my phone for all that shit. /v 0:30  Yoooooo Fuck this shit. Please! Please. Don't think this is your own self. Sitting in a room letting your thoughts flow to simultaneously the past and future, feeling at the same time pain, desire, regret and excitement all at the same time. The Mean is to be in a room just watching. Being in the moment not pretending your in the past or future. I mean why were those emotions chosen? every emotion is surely a part of life but thoughts of desire, pain and regret do not seem great to me. It's videos like this that let me know some part of the world wants to lead somewhere sad. /v First video from The School of Life that I find has No up-lifting conclusion or open door... Dear old phone. /v What a fucking human we all are becoming.... /v No, fuck this phone lol. I'm ready to throw this one in the crick. If the internet were to die tomorrow, I'd get my dreams back. When's the last time you dreamt, people? /v The problem is not in the phones and how much you use them, its when and for what  you use it. Thats when it can become toxic. /v You humans are fucking dumb /v Wow this was deep as fuck.. I LOVE IT! /v They should make a movie where computers control us. /v DAMN THIS IS GREAT MY REPLAY BUTTON WILL BE DEAD /v I never expected this song to have a choreography im shooketh /v Love them but the video looks a bit like Christine by Christine and the Queens\nStill much love from France  /v This is such a Francis and the lights vid /v Is not what i hope that will be, but it's okay /v what style of dance is this? /v The only song i like from this band lol /v I think this might be the best thing they could have ever done /v Who's smiling while watching this vid?

And for what? /v Gwyneth has gorgeous legs. /v Gwyneth's legs... /v Heard Gwyneth is an absolute bitch in real life /v Personally I can't stand Gwyneth anymore .. she's become a full on deva. /v Fuck goop and her big bird looking ass. /v Fuck Gwyneth. She's a fraud. /v Jokes are cool and all, but there's a dangerous line to tread when you invite the perpetrator of misinformation join in.  This was a fun idea, but you don't get to invite your famous friends on and make them the good guy because they can joke about it.  If she was truly sincere, she would apologize and stop this nonsense. But instead, you gave us the PR stunt/commercial.  Do better. /v There are some truth to her methods like cupping and steam. When we are sick we turn on the shower and we use steam. but stones curing you is NOT TRUE. Smelling stuff won't cure fertility. AND she is probably overpricing these methods. /v Make no mistake: Gwyneth is a snakeoil salesman. /v All I know is...gwenyth is fucking fire in that dress...reminds me of being young and dating an aspiring mode...going to work in the daytime then getting off and driving an hour to see her and she'd be wearing some shit like that...makes me wanna use my dick as a knife and stab through that stupid dress and nail her muscular ass so hard she gets whiplash....fucking hot ass bitch...she needs it...I need it..I'm a man...she's goddamn hot...i dont care if it's that dress or not she's gonna get something so hard and long over and over the dmv is gonna shut down cause it feels dumb....have you ever seen two feet spread so far apart you think they might not be attached to a human body? Well you're gonna when I crack them puppies wide and start laying into that vag like its zaxbys special sauce..dipping and dippin then drinking it in....then I'm gonna order some more when I say..UNh uh....don't you even think about flipping over! But that's not gonna happen...her eyes are gonna be rolled back in her head so far she'll be seeing the northern lights as I stroke and stroke and stroke and stroke until my legs give out and I collapse onto the floor and cry like a baby begging for her to get up and climb down off the chair and ride me like evel kenevil flying over some cars until she crashes into the pile of me below...sweat pouring off her sharp chin...hair falling around my face....i drink her sweat and run my hands up her hard abs as she's bending and crushing my tower like penis on her every stroke like she's some kind of shined hillbilly playing a saw at the county fair..I feel it bend and spring out inside her actually hitting her uterus as she stretches upward moaning the hot sweat of the night air and open windows rolling on her body filling my belly button like I've spilled my silky seed on it...as she climaxes she starts speaking in some foreign language which I later find out is the mental limit between the physical and the ethereal and she explodes in orgasm so hard she turns in to a mid air splash of pure Florida orange juice and I'm left lying in my tight blue Levi's with no shirt on in my trailer and I wake up and realize I'm just drunk and hallucinating but there is orange juice everywhere....and maybe she was there...and maybe she wasn't....but I'm thankful for my vintage heather blue Levi's orange tab boot cut vintage jeans...if I hadn't had them on with a thick leather belt...I might've put a hole in my trailer wall....all I'm saying...is that gwenyth Paltrow....in this one second I'm seeing you...you make me wanna tear you apart...I'm not saying you're beautiful or ugly or pretty or nice...I don't know what it is...but...you got what this man needs....that's all I'm saying. (Not to blow you up but...hey Margo stilley! Remember that night you came down? Yeah well I had to insert gwenyth Paltrow into it because she's fucking exploder right here...I know you were the one in the dress when I met you and it was silver not gold and you're not gwenyth Paltrow but...if I could get a hold of gwenyth Paltrow right now...well..I damn sure wouldn't be saying hi to you...you snotty evasive tart...) /v DAMN! She looks like a Playboy Playmate! Never saw her so hot hot HOT! WOo HOo! /v This goop crap should be illegal. And, shame on Gwyneth for using her celebrity status to promote such ridiculous pseudoscience. /v I think Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty hot, like most straight guys probably do, but to promote her BS lifestyle magazine / whatever is reprehensible. GOOP basically takes advantage of misinformed people, that spend money they don't have to buy things they don't need, don't work, may be harmful, and are overpriced, because they somehow trust Paltrow for advice. Some examples of snake oil scams promoted recently by the magazine: 1. Wellness stickers from NASA that were publicly discredited by NASA, which confirmed the product has no technology developed by NASA in it. 2. Yoni Jade Eggs, which women are supposed to put inside their vaginas, which in the words of OB-GYN Dr. Gunter could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome; and 3. Vaginal Steaming which doctors also call a load of garbage. Just to name a few. They have been repeatedly knocked for false advertising, misleading advertising, and settled lawsuits out of court. It is truly horrifying to see CBS promoting this garbage. I hope CBS is named in future lawsuits that are sure to come as people are injured and/or simply realize they were duped by Paltrow and GOOP. /v lock does anyone  hear larger than this version bwuf. /v Lol poop !!!! /v Goop = poop !!! why do people even buy that shit !! XD /v copying Colbert, are we? /v 4:02 I thought he was just blowing smoke up his ass. Which would be very apropos for Goop /v She will be returning in the next avengers movie /v I think this was a set up /v Don't care for whatever stupid reason Paltrow's getting all this hate. You've gotta admit she's got KILLER legs  /v Isn't she the one that has questionable life hacks? /v Why is Ian, who is a writer , holding a boom mic? /v Why do I find myself wanting to say his ass is grass? /v Vaginal steaming actually seems like... really fucking dangerous tbh. I wonder how much she paid the show to promote her shitty overpriced lifestyle magazine /v What the fuck James? What the fuck... /v there is a difference between scripted content and fucking unfunny ones... /v Is it just me or does that dress look like a half popped Jiffy Pop? /v The product designer was like ... I know this product is bullshit. How do I warn the people? I know, let's name it Goop ... so that people know that it is bullshit. /v goop... it's way too expensive to be worth it. /v Is she wearing a Jiffy Pop bag? /v To realize your dream is so simple, go to www.dreampared.ru, describe your dream, add a photo and all - your subconscious mind has got a job to realize the dream!

She even referred to her German grandmother (from whom she gets he beauty, I suspect) as a cunt. Paltrow is a hate-filled woman and a Hollywood phony.  /v This is funny.

This one is a keeper /v I can't wrap my head around the fact that such high price foundation doesn't have a pump. For that money you should definitely get a pump! /v Day 11 already! Love your videos. /v The liquid Lottie London foundation I heard is much better! /v I would love to see you review the Dior Forever foundation. I think since you have issues with longevity.. this one could work for you :) /v I have been on acutaine for a few months now and I went from having extremely oily skin with cystic acne to a few regular blemishes here and there (still not done with taking the pills) but my face is so dry now! I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though! /v Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything). /v How do you keep your teeth so white AND still drink coffee?! Taylor teach me your Taylaa ways!!! /v I'm newer here. Does anyone know if she has her eyebrows microbladed? Even before make up they looked very dark and filled in. Just curious  /v Curious, but does make up make ppl break out easier? /v Your trending girl! Thats pretty awsome, also thanks for trying out another foundation instead of making this a short fail vid. Your hard work is def. Appreciated and acknowledged!! /v FILM TUBE new Channel Frequency  /v Yay trending! You go girl!  /v Test fenty Beauty foundation bbg!! /v Does anyone know if Taylor has tried the Double Wear Light? \nSharon Farrell here on YouTube says it's her favorite. She's lighter complected and has oily skin. Thinking Taylor might like it also...?\nBtw if you don't know Sharon, go check her out. She's a awesome! Does amazing vlogs too. I feel like a lot of Taylor's subscribers would like Sharon. Good for the smart, more mature audience. /v i thought this was jaclyn hill in the thumbnail /v Sub to my channel trying to reach 1 sub /v I think this might be one of my favorites in 15 days of foundation  /v EW ! This is why I have trust issues  /v Are you gonna do a video on fenty beauty foundation? I wanna know what shade you are /v You're literally trending rn I love it /v #25 trending when I came here to watch! /v Girl! You're trending #25\nAlso that Estee Lauder foundation looks great!. /v This foundation looked so pretty on you!! I gotta try it!! /v love how that foundation looks on your skin  I want to purchase it now  /v Why does it have to end!?!?  #snapchatfam /v The way you felt about that stick foundation is how I feel about the Fit Me stick foundation. Does everything you just described. /v Wonderful review! The new Estee Lauder foundation looks beautiful! I liked the suttle shade difference too (for fair skin)! I'm definitely going to check it out. Thank you!  /v I love Double Wear. It's my holy grail. I definitely want to try this out. What was going on with the Lottie London one /v One of the best shade matches ever!! /v Your skin looks bad. I would NOT put ANYTHING on it. Eat pineapple and get some SUN! It will help kill the the acne causing bacteria and smooth your skin out. Fresh cut pineapple every other day for two weeks. And no makeup for two weeks.\n\nStart with that and you will need a lot less foundation!! /v Your videos are often the best part of my day! So glad that even though your audience grows and you are so busy outside youtube, your spark, humor and dedication to making quality content never fade <3 /v You are very honest and I love that about your channel. Keepem comin /v I loveee how much work you put into your channel  /v The face you make when you get trolled 14:54 /v I was so excited to see this idea up early! /v I kinda like the way you look better with medium coverage. It makes your skin look more natural I think. /v the stick foundation looked drier than the sahara desert. wow. /v That's so weird (the Lottie foundation) cause I have both of there's. The stick foundation is one of my favourite foundations plus it covers a lot! \n\nThough I do have fairly unblemished skin. /v Really hope you'll be reviewing the new peach foundation from Too Faced! /v is it sad I won't watch anyone else's review on the fenty foundation until I see Taylor's on day 13 cause her opinion's the only one I really care about /v Yes on Trending!!!!! That's great Taylor!  /v I am so ready for the fenty review!!! I know just about everyone I watch has enjoyed it but I'm still not sure if I wanna purchase it until I see the review here! If I can trust anyone's review 100% is from the baerrito fam. /v Please review the new FENTY foundation!!!! /v You should try out the nars velvet matte skin tint!!!!! /v You can apply the Este Lauder nude with ur finger tips /v Thataylaa, try using a thin layer of the original DW. After, apply DW Nude. You will get beautiful coverage and proper hydration!!! Although you go through a crap ton of the DW nude, at least it builds without caking if used alone. Tell me what you think off the combo of original and nude!!! /v You need to post the Fenty Beauty foundation review NOW you're number 21 on trending now, and you could get even more views and subscribers that you honestly deserve. The fenty beauty reviews are hyped right now and highly viewed. /v Trending woo /v So happy you're trending!!  /v #25 on trending!!!

In the thumbnail because it makes you not want to watch it because you know the outcome. /v girl, do more drugstore foundations! I don't have the budget lmao  /v I'm kind of disappointed that I can't get a #15daysof foundation shirrrrrrt but at the same time I understand she's doing something biggggg /v omg your video is 15th on the trending page!! Coincidence?? Love you girl  /v  So glad you did the redo but left the stick info on. Always keeping it real!!! /v Hey boo! Love your videos and so happy this foundation worked for you, I can't wait to try it out! Just one recommendation- the title is slightly misleading, because it said fail in the beginning I assumed that the Estee Lauder foundation was the fail and I almost didn't take the time to watch the video. But once again, love your videos and I'm absolutely loving 15 days of foundation <3 /v As much as I want 365 days of foundation... I think it's taking a toll on your skin Taylor.. we appreciate everything you do though thank you but give your face a rest  /v Beautiful. Thanks for showing us the fail too.

I thought it showed off her texture way too much and her skin looked uneven in color and it also made her pores show so much more with this foundation. I've seen plenty other foundations you tried look absolutely beautiful.on your skin but this one for me didn't do it for you . /v honestly, that lottie linda foundation was trash... kinda like my ex.  but you honestly looked sick, but by the end of the video you looked fabulous!!  im so sad this season of 15 DOF is almost over  /v Slag /v You're trending!

Such a shame that you are antiSemitic and didn't vote for Sanders. And: you have to create a 24/7 citizen surveillance against all members of the House and Senate. /v america is really good under natural disasters. very organized /v Kristen is prolly one of those angels of death serial killers.There's no telling how many of those old people she's taken out during the hurricane.

She's actually there eating old people, no one notices a few missing old people in a hurricane. Her cover as a beautiful, talented, classy lady is a charade, and when she collects the last of the Black Rings of Raziel, she will open up a portal to the depths and unleash Armageddon. Only Craig Ferguson and his side kick John Cena, can stop her now... Geoff the Wizard of bones predicted this while drinking with me one night. /v She should definitely go to 'The Good Place' now  /v Kristen is bae. /v Sometimes I think YouTube should get rid of the dislike button...\n...I'm guessing that at least 107 people thus far would give me a thumbs down for saying that. /v How cool is Kristen Bell!

I would never make a cupcake, or a cookie, or macarons, or a giant cookie cake, just because your nerdy (read: smiley face with glasses) logo is on it. And why would I seek out your recipes if I'm just going to end up turning them into regular old cupcakes or cookies because I don't want to bake your logo into a dessert? I used to look forward to your videos but am really disappointed with the quality lately. You used to be so much better than this. :( /v Take a challenge on eat it or wear it ...please /v Rosanna I was the one who posted me in front of your kitchen supplies on instagram My name is Sierra Lindberg /v Can you make slime please? /v Can you do something descendents 2 themed?

I understand that you need to promote it and it is really, really good but i feel that it is now repetitive. I dont mind if you do it once every few videos or something like that, but as a loyal subscriber i just wanted to let you know that i was disappointed. Nevertheless, i am still subscribed and i will continue to support you. Thank you\n\nThe rant is now over. You can scroll up and watch the video now.... /v Love this one! Can you make it gluten free?

I know you can get something to put over it, but still.. it doesn't go with any color Apple Watch. /v Yea no thanks, the series 3 without LTE is fine. /v Looks like a beef burger not a watch. And no always on? give a break with this shit /v I hate this color too :D /v Comments:\nMy android phone did this in 2009\nSomething clever about how it's just red\nSteve jobs would hate this Spicy Orange strap /v Need some help here. Can Watch series 3 sync with all iphone version? /v If that was the iwatch with the bloodsugar meter...i would buy it...but is just another smartwatch... /v Hey definitely ruined this with the fucking red thing how ugly is that /v I have a apple watch series1 but I want to get the series 3 /v you can see the phone complication up there.... Complication?? Give me a break /v absolutely no immeasurable difference between all 3 of them /v What did he say at the end? /v Apple Watch 1 + red sharpie = Apple Watch 3 /v Looks like a cheap watch for kids. /v Frankly, why can't Apple come up with better form factors for the watch?  Why does it have to look so effeminate and generic that is so bland and boring?  Seems the place (Apple) is run by engineers.  None of the products raise any heartbeats.  One would expect more from the richest company in the world! /v It will be nice if it was a standalone device with its own App Store and wireless headphones included. /v I hate people telling me Android did it first. \n\nApple did it right. \n\nHave you seen how ugly the other smart watches are? \n\nHave you seen how bad the other smart watches software is? /v Thats the best color! /v Can use old strap on this? /v Has the Apple Watch 3 now also the Qi standard or how does it work with the charging via AirPower? /v the red crown is almost a deal breaker for me. /v the ending has me weak /v And the Academy Award for photography goes to... /v You definitely don't have to upgrade from a Series 1 maybe from the first generation /v might want to blur your number at 4:04 /v ...soon the news will have ''teenager mugged for his apple watch 3...''......... /v built in obsolescence - not worth it. /v Pshhh... forget my phone I have lte data on my watch -my future self /v Hope you're not too busy with call blocking haha /v Flashed your phone number at 4:05 probably want to blur that out  /v 913 /v Dumb /v I could go on eBay and buy a more advanced and better looking watch  for a quarter of the price of this pice of Sh**t  /v ...the speaker was om MUTE...Dummy......;-),,,,,,,, /v Nobody wants your phone number /v I got your phone number! *HA HA HA* /v That Watch looks sooo sweet. I had the original Apple Watch and ended up selling it but I'm gonna ditch the Fitbit for Watch 3  /v If i made a watch with a video cam and fm radio it would sell way better then the piece of crap isuck lol /v 3 generations and same design . boooooo /v Why do you still need a phone to pair it? /v so what about the rest of the world that uses sim cards to get service /v Can you text from it? /v stupid idea to make the  button red. Apple is being destroyed by B grade designers. /v As someone that is in the smartwatch industry, everything about the watch is pretty awesome. /v SAR rating??? Strapping a cell phone to your wrist doesn't sound like the smartest idea. I do like it though. If you had to buy one thing this Apple event this is it. /v Why can't the look change or get thinner? /v good review. thanks! /v Is the series 3 going to work on tattooed wrists unlike the last 2? The last 2 series would not stay unlocked on a tattooed wrist. /v is that a cellular one ? /v is it water proof? /v I don't care who makes a watch but LTE is no place for a watch. This is just another way to justify the price of a device across the board nut just Apple. How fast can the OS of a watch run? It's a damn watch, so buy the watch cuz it's fast then buy iPhone 4 just to make calls? Until there is something significant that the series 2 watch can't do, then it's a waist of $$$$$. /v Im really for it, it really depends on how much it will cost monthly. It better not be any more than 10 dollars /v Can someone please explain what it means to have the LTE? If I buy the non LTE, can I still use my watch without having my iPhone on my at all times? /v Does anobody know: \n\nWill the new heart rate monitoring stuff be made available to the older Apple watch revisions as well? /v Imagine if Bernie was president,\n\n\n\n\n\n% /v I used to think he was funny. Now he's just petty and partisan. /v You comedians are never happy with anything anyone who doesn't conform to your ideology does. /v Can this dumbass go back to England /v Liberals are retarded this British Horse Teeth Retard is not funny only talented thing about him is his retarded accent. /v My my my...who WILL you whine about after this Presidency, Mr. Smug Briton? How is it even your concern? /v Yes the world is falling apart but I gotta shit on trump because only money fuck the audience /v One of the best presidents we've ever had!  Sure to win again in 2020. /v This guy has dedicated his show to donald trump for the past year. What a fucking cuck. God damn i hate this fool /v What's tomorrow's bashing if the pres gonna be retard /v Wasn't this the same guy who said he wasn't gonna be president  /v Ivanka is like a dumb hoe from game of thrones that doesn't deserve anything but gets it cuz he dads the king /v Isn't this the guy that was wishing Trump would run against Hillary... I'm sorry who's not very smart?  That would be you. Trump's trying to get a deal done on tax reform... it's hilarious... your followers are just as dumb as you are. /v trump agrees with democrats: liberal backlash\ntrump agrees with republicans: liberal backlash\nyou just cant win with john oliver can you? /v NOTE: Trump's works with Democrats and bill is passed in two days.

We are all on our way to hell, forever. God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. Its one place or the other. Jesus answered, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless. /v Why is this propaganda up on YouTube again?

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. /v gave me a shiver down my spine and made me it my pants /v You forgot to mention the biggest clown ever, POTUS TRUMP! /v If i see a clown i will pull a switch blade /v Did anyone catch when Link whispered penny weiner after when he said penny wenny  /v I love Link so much what a babe /v For years after watching It, I was afraid of drains. /v Was I the only one who thought Prison Clowning too? /v I was literally the only kid in the theater and one of the only one that wasn't scared and enjoyed the movie /v Who say the pic of a clown by the guitars /v i haven't watched GMM in like 4 years and that intro has gotten me to come back. /v But the one that should be #1 is my brother /v Look at the back photo there's a clown picture /v I saw the new movie it I  was way scared than the first one /v Rodeo clowning!!!!!

Some of the wording is exactly the same https://youtu.be/wvaYN7ElTl0 /v Moral of the story: If two storms collide, you are fucked. /v 1:03\nOh hi Philippines\n(Note: we have two hurricanes/typhoons in the Philippines right now soooo) /v Everyone knows that when I need climate and meteorological info, I go to a tech channel... /v Well we had here in the Philippines before, year \n2009 /v NATO, haarp, climate change, etc. /v I just saw my country /v Robot voice: When worlds collide \n\nCaveman: You can run, but no can hide....\n\nRobot: When worlds collide you'll laugh so hard you'll swear you died when worlds collide\nhold my hand I'll be your guide\nwhen worlds collide\nbuckle-buckle-buckle up for the sweetest ride and prepare to have your mind blown wide\nwhen worlds collide\n\nCaveman : When worlds collide it's a curious thing\nbet you've never heard a robot and a caveman sing.\nin his chest are some working parts, but how is that different than a beating heart?\n\nRobot: Im from the future\nCaveman: And I'm from the past,\nRobot: but that doesn't mean that this friendship wasn't built to last\nCavman: He was made in a lab, and I was born in a cave.\nso let me hear you holler in this Inter-era rave\n\nRobot: when worlds colide. /v 0:18 if u looked at the background,it is classified as a typhoon not hurricane/s /v I like watching the swirly clouds on the top, so beautiful, yet so destructive /v ...the year in the Irwin and the other hurricane is wrong. Nevertheless, this was quite interesting. /v Love the music /v Basically it's the same as galaxies. If they are small, they start orbiting the big one. If they are the same size, they collide. /v It gets bigger. End of discussion /v The MUSIC is awesome! /v If there is a hurricane in the US, Tech Insider posts videos just about hurricanes.\nWhen there's an election in the US, Tech Insider posts videos about politics.\nWhen there's an earthquake in the US, Tech Insider posts videos about earthquakes.\nWhen TI sees a video they can make profit on, they upload it.\n\nThis is my observation of this channel, there is almost no tech present in here, and for that reason I'm out. /v Reminds me of that movie, 'A Perfect Storm.' /v A ballroom dance really does *stun* you. /v Surprised by comment section expect to see more Hilary jokes  but their almost none so this is  a good section /v 4 hurricanes in the Carribeans in the space of one month. RIP Jamaica. RIP Cuba. RIP everyone in the Carribeans. /v Warmer Climate the cause u say, eh? Trump say, Nay, its China! /v It's the perfect storm... /v This is a repost /v Can you imagine if Harvey and Irma would have collided? It would be the biggest hurricane ever!!  /v Why can't we figure out some awesome plan to stop global warming, global warming is bad and no one cares about it /v so this is how the giant storm in jupiter is still alive /v And 9 months later you have a little category 1 /v This is also a case of the planets gravitational pull /v so its basically like a black hole collision /v Philippines have hurricanes right now! /v What is the white stuff in Hurricane diagrams? /v They had to make up some crap at the end and then blame global warming /v There were two cyclones that collided with each other over one litter town in Australia, and boy, that town almost got obliterated! /v So basically, if two Hurricanes collide, pack your bags and move to Saturn\n\nOh wait, there's a Hurricane that's much, much larger than Hurricane Irma on Saturn. Then I guess, move to Mars?\n\nThat is, if you can survive the gravity of thousands of Earths. Move to Uranus if you can't\n\nThen again, it's a Gas planet, so you won't be able to even touch it. Then, I guess, move to the opposite side of the Planet away from that?\n\nBut what if a Tsunami happens?\n\nIn short, moving to another planet means You're fucked, and moving on the other side of the Planet, still means You're fucked, so I guess of this ever happens, that simply means YOU. ARE. FUCKED! /v The background music made it look like a scary weather dance. /v Hey! Maybe Earth will get a Great Red Spot like Jupiter! A hurricane that circles the planet for centuries! Just imagine the excitement! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v Are all the downvotes from the meteorological experts in the comments?! Uhm they made a mistake I'm a climate expert in the comments! /v The movie 2012... But for real... Nice. /v Be badass if in the future can we create mega af hurricanes and send them to intercept the natural ones heading towards us whoever invents that hmu /v LIKE BLACK HOLES COLLIDING /v FUJIWHARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /v So we're fucked /v What if two tornados collide? /v They DANCE /v ok /v Philippines - Meh. /v Wow looks like space storms. /v Some weird ass music /v fidget spinner /v Boiiii some hurricane saves Philippines life\nTanks fam. /v Fuck Tech Insider. /v Hurricane Hilary? /v KENSEI DORIFTO?!?!?!! /v Its called agar.io  /v Just like Agar.io /v Fujiwhara that reminds me of something...Hmm....\n\n\n*TAKUMI FUJIWARA* /v Like galaxies when they collide /v Soo, what if two category 5 storms collided? /v Hurricane.io /v Hurricane Irma and Jose /v Hurricane Haiyan + Hurricane Irma = Had sex = Heaven /v Thats not a hurricane thats a typhoon /v Speak! /v https://youtu.be/chKYdkMJDAc /v Geostorm!!!!!! /v Nani?! Multi hurricane drifting?! /v Fusion ha!!!!!! /v They look like galaxy's so they shall collide like galaxies /v Global Warming suggests increase of hurricanes. Filthy goyim pay your carbon taxes. We need money to fix these hurricanes. /v I do not believe this. Global Warming is a lie. Donald J. Trump is amazing. /v Source NASA!!!!!! This bullshit is a hoax /v What if the 3 hurricanes we have now were to merge? /v If hurricane Harvey and Irma collided, I'm gone... /v Why was this trending? /v 1:07 rip phillipines. /v Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show. /v Yes! Tomorrow night!  /v i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase. /v Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck /v tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie /v Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait! /v I've been waiting for this forever /v South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them. /v feeling good on a wednesday /v Will the new episode be on Hulu? /v High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D /v There's a bee in here! /v they took your job /v Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck. /v Shit like this is why I love South Park /v Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo /v This is going to be awesome. /v The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :) /v I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous /v Please make a mockery of antifa to /v I've missed South Park /v GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED /v TEY TOOK UR JEEEWBSSS /v DEY TUK ER JERBS!!!!!!!! /v I l southpar /v OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3 /v YEAH TIP ASSIST /v YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY /v HAHAHAHA /v nice 2 second clip guys. /v Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss! /v DER TERK ER JERB /v I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing. /v STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER. /v Please do a skit about that fat bitch terrorist that died of a heart attack. /v King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D /v Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless /v Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year. /v South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode. /v If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school. /v Was that Master Chief at 0:05?! /v They will fuck it up same way some how /v This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19. /v Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season. /v OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone /v My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today /v Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :))) /v This little show by the name of Rick and Morty just summed up everything salient about Trump America in one (fucking brilliant) half-hour episode.\nHonestly, I stopped hoping Parker and Stone could do half as well--- about 15 years before Trump decided to run. /v Did they get the Bee? /v Can't wait untill it's just one poorly executed plotline again /v Don't make Eric a bitch again, I want to see him screw with butters !!!!! /v Boruto and South Park episodes coming out at the same day? /v Please say south park has gone back to normal with the kids and there ridiculous antics. Also I thought they would have only finished the episode like today.... /v every time they say bee it duplicates the video /v Does Randy have great temples? /v Are they gonna make fun of the anti-sjw' now? /v I'm excited for this, the game, and the Sims for PS4 though that comes out in November either way yes..... /v Wish they would go back to how they were in the 90s and early 2000's I miss the old South Park. Hope this season is good. Tired of all the political shit gets old and boring. Not even funny. /v Watch my YouTube videos /v Why is this trending? /v I'll get it LMAO /v Stupid Trump supporters. /v THEY DERK ER DERBS!!! /v THE TOOK UER JEEEb!! /v DEY TOOK AR JABS!! /v Orgasmoooooooooooooos /v Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit /v I member  /v I doubt that the new season will be as good as the 2003 - 2010 episodes.. this show went down hill in 2011 /v What seems to be the officer, problem? /v I'll watch it but I'm not that excited about it /v Politics again? I just want the characters to do dumb shit like in the Xbox vs PS4 trilogy or The Ungroundable (the episode where they played call of duty during class). /v Awesome. /v Chief, no! /v They took dur durrr /v amazing work! /v DAS YUDEN \nGAS \nGAS\nGAS /v Can't wait! /v So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals /v As retarded as this show is, I still love it. /v Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back. /v Long Live the Confederacy /v Heh, we criticise the ess jay duble uuus and the altright two scoop natsees /v Welp This show is dead I used to watch it from season 1 in 1997 if that's correct but now I will never watch it again I member (pun intended) when this show would kill kenny every episode have random plot lines and now it's just political shit I thought u said u would end the politics story line shit and the carecters now cartman a evil boy now just a fairy shit bag randy the new main carecter literally and kenny the background carecter u call him a main carecter he never appears anymore u should give him screen time the bus stop is dead pc pricible was the main reason this show is shit if u would have killed him off like u said u would maybe mr garrison wouldn't care about the Canadians and the show would never be all politics I will watch it tommaro but if it's all political shit and not about the kids (like you said) I will quit this show better make me happy from ur old loyal fan from day one who's about to quit this show good day and pls read this ps pls make this show better /v Antifa and BLM raise hell for a year, no South Park commentary\n\nOne single dumb girl crosses the street and gets hit by a car and they make a whole episode barraging white people? When did this show become so fucking politically correct? /v Let me guess. They're going to do the same thing other so called comedy shows are doing and just waste our time complaining about President Trump. /v trump commits suicide after south park premiere /v first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience! /v Finally. Dealing with the fucking confederates. /v Trumptards /v That reference though lol /v These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is. /v (((South Park))) /v LMAO WHITE TRASH /v R.I.P. South Park. /v That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority! /v Learn the truth about Charlottesville. /v I love south park because it dosent matter if your right or left cause you still gonna get shit XD /v The Alt Right is the future! /v S.H.I.E.L.D is dealing with super human threats even without Captain America ever since Agent Carter and Howard Star started it. And Hank Pym was around for a long time even after WWII. You failed the Antman movie, After Hours team. The Avengers are just a scouted new superhero generation. /v Did you see that katy? I diagreed! Kek. /v NO Nick Fury ,, fought off Skrull off before he even meet Tony ,, this alll will be reviled in Captain Marvel  that would be a time based movie set in the pass before Iron man and Hulk and Avengers /v If that theory about Gandalf secretly being Voldermort is a real theory, I'd love a video about that /v Michael, why/how are you in the audience of the Dave Chappelle Netflix special? /v Catculator... that got me way too good /v Your Marvel theory lacks X-Men. The Avengers are only separate in the movie universe because of the studio rights. Nick Fury knew there were super dudes and many x-men were avengers in the comics but can't be tied again due to rights. So realistically, just as in Deadpool where other x-men were referenced but not show because they couldn't afford rights for any major characters, there were plenty Superheroes in the world to justify the creation of the Avengers.... just not enough studio cooperation to do so lol /v You forgot the best Friday the 13th film- Jason X /v I love that Daniel pronounces Voldemort in that annoyingly correct way, instead of how the say it in the movies. /v What's in the box? /v With the mcu time line there is a theory that Nick Fury is a clairvoyant so it would make sense that he knew all about Thor, The Hulk, and the New York attack so that's why he recuited Iron Man before any of that happened. /v Wtf is this shit? Lmao \nThis acting corny af! Like watching a group of retards act /v Oh god. Thanks be to putting the originals back on. Gooooood job /v Fury is not crazy:There were not just reports of The Hulk, the US military fought him and then he fought Abomination downtown. He already had Natasha and Clint on his payroll. All that was missing was Thor.Besides SHIELD probably knew about many others. Even so, the World Council knew about this, which would make them crazy too. /v Is no one going to mention the fact that Hawkeye, Black Widow, Ironman, Ant-Man, Technically captain marvel because her movie is set to be in the (90s or 80s), and presumably the hulk, is still an amazingly good team for the avengers initiative. /v I'm so glad she brought up the Friday the 13th timeline. I've always tried to pinpoint the years that are supposed to have passed between each film. Also, when she mentions the Evil Dead being part of the shared Universe, it should be noted that a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason was drafted that had Ash from Evil Dead fighting them both. /v I thought of the same thing Daniel did and asked the same thing. Fury wants to establish a response team to supernormal threats, but who is on his list? Romanov and Barton? 2 human SHIELD agents? Plus, he didn't even want Stark. He wanted Iron Man. So who is actually part of the Avengers Initiative? /v Did you just say that the first Iron Man took place before World War II? /v Did they meen army of darkness not evil dead /v thank the mighty buddha it's not the other four /v ya the A team is back!!! /v Wait.\nThe incredible hulk movie enstablished that hulk ALREADY exists in the mcu, is not an origin story. /v These are all consecutive nights? I always thought that they were weekly gettogethers. /v Friday the 13th < Nightmare on Elm Street /v Nothing like the originals! /v The thing from Se7en bothered me too /v Wonder how many movie timelines do add up? /v Katie is a Friday the 13th fanatic? If I wasn't married I'd be proposing right now /v Man...I need to go watch Seven... /v you're not supposed to think about these things!!! jeez! /v Thank fuck it was the A team, am I right? /v i think these all line up perfectly. so therefore. i win /v The marvel one isn't valid. Fury new about the existence of Iron Man, Hulk, Ant Man, and potentially Captain America. Its also possible he knew about Black Panther (as seen how Wakanda is a highlighted region on Shield's map in Iron man 2). Apparently, he also new about Captain Marvel, which takes place in the 90s. \n\nThe point is he knew there were other super heroes in the world besides Iron Man and was likely planning to recruit any that he  could to be on the avengers. /v never leave again bitches. i almost said goodbye to afterhours /v Ya sorry as much as I wish I liked the new crew the original 4 are just so much better /v Have y'all got star doing the drawings now? /v I have a whole seven page timeline on Friday the 13th. /v Katie is a boss. Finally a proper break down of my other favorite Friday film series. Wait what if Debo is Jason??? :O /v I should not have laughed so hard at that last cat joke... /v Ah, the reason I subscribed. Before the SJW preaching videos appeared and made me wanna puke. Good times. /v After Watching: 300 Viewers Who Don't Care /v So... are we all cats then? /v Please please please oh please just stick with these four /v Why is Jake Paul in this? /v Nick Fury is like the NSA being created after 911. A catastrophe happens, and he jumps on the opportunity to create his superteam project because tax dollars are flowing to defense spending. /v I won't read this comment. What a Dick I am, I can't believe I just read this. I am pathetic! /v Wow...everyone just shittin all over a beloved horror franchise lol /v Wow. Even if we assume the After Hours guys only meet once a week, 80 episodes means they've been doing it less than 2 years... It feels longer. /v Ima be that guy. Agents of SHIELD showed that SHIELD had its eye on, and if I remember correctly locked up, plenty of super powered people. Its just that none of them ended up making the cut, which is pretty amazing because thor made the cut just by showing up and trying to kill cap and tony. /v Is After Hours usually this high def? /v I've seen the Marvel timeline but that never occurred to me /v I saw this on the trending page. I wasn't going to keep watching this until I saw Star in the background. RIP Sourcefed. /v So their is actually a reason fury has to start the avengers initiative according to marvel captain marvel takes place in the 90's with fury in it against the skrull. /v Fury knows about aliens cause of captain marvel /v i disagree with the billions of dollars spent on the avengers initiative  because  they  didn't spend much at all tony payed for almost all of it /v In agents of shield...I know I know. SHIELD already knows about the kree and the inhumans so...avengers needed? /v Im in love with all but one of them. I wont say who. \n\nThat would be awkward. /v This pretty much confirms for me that Fury learns about Skrulls in the 1990s (Capt. Marvel movie), and waits until someone pops up (e.g. Iron Man) to start an initiative towards fighting them. /v Dark Knight Rises should be on here if it's not. Honestly don't know how Bruce Wayne got back to Gotham after the prison escape so quickly. /v In the backround you can see the woman sorting out the cards /v so the cards are a metaphore for the actually funny actually talented group we see here and we're supposed to let you guys go so we can have the 4 new untalented unfunny shitlords? /v 8:15 the only reason youre here. thank me later /v Someone must have not remembered the avengers!!! They started the avengers in the movie avengers. The team was an idea before that movie as a fail safe but was never formed. The government had shut it down before it was formed as said in the movie and only was formed becauce of Loki. Annnnnnd they already knew of super powered beings from the hulk having existed well before iron man 1, ant man existed, and captain America existed (and was frozen unbeknownst) so they had an idea to find super powered beings around the world and get them on the side of good knowing that the odds that all super beings being friendly is super low. They then went out in search from the start of iron man until the avengers creating a superbeing archive of names and people that were super powered to decide if they are good or bad and then create a fail safe using the good super beings. Then Loki strikes and Thor comes and that's when nick fury reaches out to all those archived super heroes to create the avengers in said movie. /v *Looks at the vote bar* yeah, this is an original cast video. /v How is tina shepherd 7 in 1990 and 16 in 2001? /v Nick fury in the comics had resources that are literally outta of this world. He is the man behind the wall fighting off monsters before they become a problem. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a way to get to Asgard or figured out Iron man's identity. PLus he is good at improvising. /v Hey, Katy got a good pun in there. It only took her a few months, too. /v I liked simply for Katie's pun at the end! /v Oh ha ha\n\nI love the same jokes every single episode \n\nSo fresh so funny /v I'm sorry, but your acting is awful, not one word came across as natural. I've seen more believeable delivery from professional wrestling promos. It would have been far better if you had done it without memorising a script, and then edited it down. /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Why do they keep awkwardly zooming in on faces /v You know what would make things a lot easier, get 2 boxes and label them not used and used cards. /v in the time of watching this my brain exploded; 2 months ago. /v 7:50 easier explanation... he had an accomplice... /v They almost threw away the best joke: Cat-culator! /v Best episode! I lost it at MY CARDS!! /v i get it that nobody cares about the extended universe of ANY franchise, but SHIELD did have the guest house alien for a while /v I think something that would help me like the new cast more would be to make twice as many of both sets. /v Thank god the original cast is back. /v Well John Doe could have decided in advance that Envy was his sin, and that he wanted Rage to be the guy who kills him. Part of his manifesto is that the whole world is corrupt, that the victims are not that particularly chosen, but that it could be anyone. It would probably be a big thing for him that mostly anyone could be driven to kill in rage if you push them the right way. He could have decided to use Mills for Rage during their chase, that's why he spares his life, he's like yesss, this one will do.. and starts planning how he can get envious at him and drive him to killing. /v What if the delivery guy in Seven is the real John Doe and Kevin Spacey is just a crazy man that he has brainwashed to take the blame. /v Best regards To you and to see A journey to the beautiful places of the world watch by clicking here #geniusbuddy now /v So glad this isn't another episode of sruoH retfA /v I don't understand the problem with the Back to the Future series. They experiencing time in the last, not the present so they can return to any time they want /v Not sponsored by Coca Cola.. /v BRING BACK DOES NOT COMPUTE!!!!!!! /v Wait... is that place Poquito Mas? /v Cat-culator!

You know its true.  **EDIT.  not so much of a color thing, but a culture thing. /v C'mon Don u know u wish that was Al Roker!!

And you wonder why men don't respect you girls /v Who is this nothing bitch? What a pointless individual! /v she is completely clueless /v Haha Jim Carrey trolled the fuck out of you! /v This no-name bitch is feeling 'sad' for Jim Carrey.. How thick-skulled can a reporter be? He started the fucking interview with this is all meaningless of course he's going to give your eye-rolling face a sarcastic interview. I never thought E! News was credible (obviously), but this really takes the cake for obliviousness. /v You were sad for the person who called you out on being meaningless?  You pompous, self-inflating people got embarrassed because a celebrity didn't do what you wanted and instead gave you a truth you couldn't swallow.  Do you really take yourselves that seriously? /v If you ever get a chance, watch the DVD extras of a movie called Bat Thumb. The character who plays Wuce Bayne has a speech just like the start of this video. Mannerisms to a T! Hahaha /v Bunch of airheads over at E! News, I'm in the dark, what's exactly the issue here? /v He is a powerful man, well done JC. /v This is what happens when a monkey try to read a book of knowledge /v Who is truly the brainwashed sheep. Jim who has seen the truth, or you who are still blind.\n\nI'll let you think about that one, Catt. /v He legit is the only sane one there....and her saying she's sad for him is the saddest thing ever...these corrupt lowlife self-contained robots are the downfall of this world and because this man actually sees life for what it's really worth their going to make him look insane....they need to look at the monsters they've become...hypnotizing a generation into being stuck up judgemental snobs....shame on them for doing that to our youth....the message Jim Carrey just sent out live to the world is what needs to be known ....we're all energy ..they want you to see black white yellow brown....he doesn't see that and neither should the rest of us....we're all the same in the end /v Just because you can't comprehend what he tried explaining to you doesn't mean something is wrong with him.  Stick to fashion. /v This condescending, pretentious nitwit couldn't hold a deep conversation with someone as much as a glass of water could. He's right: fashion week is pointless. Her job is pointless. Entertainment news is pointless. /v What's wrong with her hair in the interview? /v Honey your brain is too limited to understand what Jimmy and similar people are talking about, btw look at your dislikes /v That woman is an idiot. Why would he want to agree to have on open conversation with someone with nothing but dead air between her ears? /v When you talk about something different and try to have a intellectual conversation rather than who's sleeping with who or which celebrity is pregnant or which one has the biggest tits all of a sudden you are bizzare /v Fashion week is a dull event with dull people. It seems Jim had some fun amongst so much vane people. /v Wow, I expected the interview to be so much more shocking. These children can't have a conversation these days. It's all about me! me! me! me! me! me! /v Most meaningless thing happening. I'd say he's spot on. /v You should not be sad for him, I'm sad for you and your audience that doesn't get it.  The rest of the world needs to catch up with the wisdom he is sharing. /v Dude what the fuck. E news didn't show all of it. Jim Carrey doesn't have a twisted relationship with fame. Jim Carrey (somewhere along the way) humbled himself and realized that the world doesn't revolve around money, fame, and the spotlight. There's more to life than Hollywood and I'm actually with Jim on this shit. It doesn't matter, not a fucking bit. Psychedelics may or may not have been involved in his thought process but at least he's not a scientologist. /v This happens when you take too much substance. /v I think it's important to watch the full video. I believe he's on to something. This version is horribly edited. I think Jim Carey could sit down and explain this but I think the background laughing and editing on this video don't do the full segment justice. I know they have to keep it short but I like people to provide the link in the description if they are going to edit something.\nHere's the link to the video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5s0vpVIOXg /v People are so judge mental /v The red pilled your meaningless zombie life, but you're to drunk on the kool-aid to see the forest for all the trees. Clearly he was the only human at the event. Go back to sleep zombie girl, shhhh good night. /v He was clearly fucking with her what an idiot she is to not understand that /v lol you guys got called out and cut it out of the video\nLmaooo get fucked. /v This is what Mastodon use to do on the Grammys for the same reasons, I think. /v People call crazy what they can't understand /v Nothing bizarre here. Whole thing is being over-hyped smh media. /v Isn't this the belief of the Democrat party.  No this is Masonic teaching. Hahahahhaba /v This is seriously what you guys talk about in California? How fucking boring... /v BITCH!!! maybe all this entertainment business fucked with YOUR head /v This chick is such a moron /v Come on everyone! Listen to his words. He's babbling Scientology bullshit. /v I didnt listen to any word that was weird. Im not even a jim carrey fan. Media sucks. /v Meeeen... They talk about him like he was crazy or needed help, when in true it's them who lost it. Live Forever Jim! Love ya! /v Hahaha E! News are retarded. Love you Jim! /v He sounds like Jaden Smith.. but fuck them for shaming Jim Carey /v What a condescending shallow cunt and those 3 other cunts laughing.. Yes it wasn't the best place to express those sentiments BUT nothing he said was bizarre or indicated a man who has lost touch with reality if anything it was the opposite and btw he's a comedian so the joke is on y'all. Also why would he do an interview with someone so unprofessional. /v Lmfao now she's going to go crazy with the comments because she thought everyone was going to be on her side lol /v please stop giving energy to the reporter... this is the most publicity she's ever gotten in her life. lets stop doing her favors /v He was serious.  Fashion is shallow and the amount of emphasis placed on it is obnoxious.  Art is important but fashion is no longer art. /v Guy is losing it, just like most Hollywood stars ... duh fuQ is going on in Hollywood?!? /v THAT'S THE 3rd FREAKING TIME HE'S TRIED TO EXPOSE HOLLYWIERD AND IT FELL ON DEAF EARS... SMFH... SO SAD, BUT WE HEAR YA, JIM!!!!!!! /v She's dumb as rocks. /v i hope you die bitch /v How is this trending with 176 comments.. This is why I hate the trending tab.. Because it's all dumb as fuck /v He's the only smart one there. /v Like me IDGAF about what famous rich people are doing and wearing. Not one fuck. /v This guy is a real dope /v He is above your condescension, obviously. /v i was a little sad for himmmm... ya know??! /v Sad for him? So u did get the message /v Who the fuck is this bitch. Idiot /v U can see n.hear satan all in him never listen to long to a liar they start confusing u ...its never chamged since the garden of Eden in genesis...jim carrey neeeds to repent its hard to tell who for god these days but to sum it up he is bashing god in.his deceitful way...saying there is no god may the lord turn his own toungue against him and counsel against him to foolishness...go bk to the garden of eden.PEOPLE stsrt over repent romans 10:9 is the way obey gods commandments luv him above all build a relationship with him thru jesus christ he is awesome n.he loves u...never forget that Deuteronomy 28 and 30 ... /v His clothes look like they are from the VR related movie Spielberg is making... The Oasis scene... /v Hey Lady if by talking seriously  you mean talking about clothes, shoes and gossip then you shouldn't interview people as Jim Carrey. You have two different levels of consciousness and yours is pretty low. All I see in this video is a very intelligent and spiritual man talking to an ignorant woman who cares only about the surface. He should have looked at you the way you've looked at him. But the world's crazy and unfortunately people like you are considered the 'normal ones' and the ones like Jim Carrey are the 'freaks'. Sad story. /v Terribly rude interviewer... lost a lot of respect for E News after this and won't be watching anymore. /v I laughed when she said Jim Carrey if you're watching this and want an interview i'm ready..... the fu*k b!tch he doesn't care about you, you're not even the level of his shoes. /v Everything he said just went over their heads. In a world of ignorance, truth can sound insane. Might i suggest you all squeegee your third eye and realize that ego is a mental delusion, that's what he meant by there is no me. Personality like Celebrity is an abstract, what are we without our names, jobs, social status, etc? A bunch of tetrahedrons A.K.A atoms. That's it. We're star stuff as Carl Sagan put it. /v THAT was what the fuss was about???  LOL .. its just him messing off!  WTF is all the fuss about? /v E news, WTF are you on about.  Jim is on point, you guys are just a fake bullshit media outlet and you're not what the new generation seeks anymore either.  The new generation can pick and choose their media and the younger people have realized that being spoonfed this garbage doesn't help them at all.  They would rather be enlightened.  Your days are outnumbered. /v Wow, these commentators seem quite proud of their ignorance. /v You suck ugly lady without a soul and those other bastards!! you people  are  /v Y'all don't quite understand the law of attraction. Just a bunch of sheep and sheep's opinions. /v E news is absolutely meaningless. Everything E news represents is meaningless. E news sells empty, consumer driven preconceived notions of a beauty and cultural ideals. Maintaining a distracted audience dedicated to mindless celebrity worship to keep the gears of conformity continuing to rotate further enriching the wealthy and large profit-seeking corporations. /v He's talking about awareness. He's talking about Advaita, non-dualism, Lila, Tandava, cosmic unfolding. Whichever name you want to give it. Sounds like he's annoyed at the materialism of Hollywood and his mandatory role in these sorts of events. Also sounds like he's having a bit of fun while having to go through the whole rigmarole. Perfectly understandable. Is this actually surprising to anyone? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised :D /v How much hair gel is this bitch wearing? /v This title of this video is incredibly condescending. Way to go E! /v He goofed with you and you don't get that, he doesn't give a fuck because you are there for him hes not there for you. /v These clones have no souls  of course they don't get it /v He is saying some deep shit about how fashion and other pointless celebrity endeavours are worthless and meaningless. He is completely right. And you look at him and talk about him like he a weird crazy man just because he doesn't feed you the predetermined bullshit about clothes that you expected. Fuck E news, Fuck this reporter and Fuck anything else that suppresses free thought. Love Jim Carey for doing this. He's so intelligent in comparison to the people who surround him that they think he's the deluded one. it's nuts /v Jim Carrey is RIGHT, u self obsessed, shallow morons. Youre just unenlightened And in light of losing someone he loves to suicide.....do YOU really matter? NO !!! No, you do not. But you know what matters even less than you? Is fashion. Or what u think is in and fashionable. Don't u know there is an entire world out here that see you all as foolish, laughable and quite silly. /v Jim Carney is brilliant, He's woken up to the truth about Hollywood and how fake they all are and what their priorities and agenda is , it is all meaningless cause you can't take fashion or mansions or your money with you when you die,  when have you ever seen a Uhaul truck in the back of a hearse ? He's more focused on deeper things now like real life , how we are all one than what is the hottest fashion trend that will die off in a year anyway , He gets it now and Hollywood can't handle it , Don't feel sorry for Jim , feel sorry for those in Hollywood getting sucked into the non sense . Jim is sharper than ever /v Not dissing Carey but it sums up Hollyweird.  A fake industry of social climbers filled with fruits and nuts.  The same people that applaud the violence of SJW's in their awards shows while they hand out trophies to each other, slapping each other on the back for being awesomely overpaid for meaningless jobs. /v You got trolled you dumb cow /v She is meaningless /v stupid cunt /v Illuminati /v Wow... you suck at reporting. /v I love Eckhart Tolle too /v What a CUNT!! /v E news sucks! /v Lol /v Jim gets it lol U stupid bobble head U  dont. /v stupid cunt /v *deep* /v 151st /v die from ebola jim bob /v This Nigga Need Jesus. /v The black dude is SUUUUUUCH A FAAAG /v hasn't he been channeling carl sagon lately? /v Oups, Jim Carrey just spoke the truth ! /v MK ULTRA!!! /v Don't do drugs !!! /v nothing is real /v This lady annoying looking af /v What a fucking cunt. Lol. /v Lol I hope you actually liked it here in Australia /v Omg it's bee-gah (bega!). And pls try the correct brand of honey soy  /v You didn't get the good Honey Soy! /v I love all of these chips !!\nOh and it's oi not oy /v bega is a brand of cheese so it was cheese flavoured /v I lost my shit when I realised mature cheddar cheese and chive literally is just sour cream and onion  /v I live in Australia. I love ur vids btw  /v Honey soy chicken is my go to drunk chip packet!!!!! /v The Beqa one is cheese. Beqa is a brand of cheese. /v Mine are barbecue, cheese & onion and light & tangy, but i can't get with those regular cheddar flavours. \nAnd chicken I can't stand, it really tastes nothing like it. It just tastes like bad memories... /v the way brooks says bega though    /v But what flavours are in the USA????? /v Did anyone else die laughing at the pronunciation of Bega??

Glad you enjoyed Melbourne darl x /v Ketchup chips taste like dirt to me :/ Cheese and onion forever :) Red rock deli is fab too /v drunk me *loves* those lime and black pepper chips. /v I WAS IN THE CROWD AND I CAN SEE MYSELF /v Bega is pronounced like it's spelt, with an E not an A.

I live in melbourne too. perhaps i can take your left-overs off your hands /v Oh how I love being Australian /v When you have to look up what Bega Cheese is.... /v The Ketchup flavour first came out when I was a kid and I wasn't enthused by it, by now in my early 30's I think it's great. I don't know. /v the red rock deli honey soy chicken is better........ -your friendly neighbourhood Australian /v Great first date tip at 4:57: ''Blindfold them immediately and force-feed them things they don't know!'' My favourite flavour is the ''Kettle CHILLI with Jalapeno & Red Chillies'' now that you've pain-tested it (at 6:20). /v I was so surprised that they don't know what Peri Peri is  we have Nando's here in Pakistan  /v This makes me so hungry for chips. The pepper and lime ones are yum or the honey soy chicken ones are if i want something that tastes like a meal lols /v Go to England and do the same taste test Grace. Apparently they have Australian BBQ Kangaroo flavoured chips. I gots to know what they taste like! /v The Pringles is pronounced peri peri like Katy perry /v We have basically all these flavoured in the UK how do you guys not have CHEESE AND ONION ITS SO STANDARD!! /v Never clicked on a video so fast! /v i live in australia and i didn't even know that most of these existed...  /v I say this every video but Grace I'm so happy for you and Brooks!!

UGH IM SO HAPPY FOR U!!!! /v Peri peri is a type of chicken /v Woah didnt know she came here for Vidcon, wish it was in my state though :( /v why did he buy all the bad ones givin us a bad rep /v The pronounciation of Bega is bee-gah /v I've been to the US and you guys have way more chips than us Aussies do. Shit like BBQ Chicken Fairy Floss Hubba Bubba Mint Chocolate Oreo Red Pepper Sriracha Gun Powder Cheetos /v Wait - I thought all countries had a billion chip flavours...\nWelp, I guess I'm just a very sheltered Australian teenager who's never travelled out of the country. Lol. /v grace, love ya, but bloody oath if i hear 'tomato sauce' being called 'ketchup' once more,,,,,,,, boi /v Smiths, you know you love em /v It's pronounced bee-ga btw :P /v red rock deli honey soy chicken is my fave /v perth? /v We normally call ketchup tomato sauce. /v It's spelt oi oi oi  /v Shouldve tried shapes!!!!!! :) /v Peri peri is spicy /v we dont have brisket in aus :/ /v It is pronounced Bee-ga /v Sour cream and onion pringles woulda been better /v PERI PERI CH8CKEN, PERI PERI CHICKEN, PERI PERI CHICKEN CHICKEN SUB /v It actually goes Aussie Aussie Aussie OI OI OI!!!!

Give me blue swimmer crab cook in the water(if clean) they are caught out of over a crawchy Anyday. /v Go New Zealand: meat pies, fish & chips, steak.. our food is way better foreaaals ;) /v 5:27 that is just the most inhumane way to kill such a delicate creature /v I hate Buzzfeed but I love this series. Great content, I'd watch this on tv /v Please please come to Brisbane, and try the $2 steaks on Sundays and Mondays at Jubilee Hotel (pub). /v the chef in the last place sounds singaporean /v I think a cool worth it video idea would be different wines down in the Barossa Valley in South Australia... Just suggesting it... /v Is it me or is Adam getting hotter? /v wooh I live in Perth /v Just saying but doesn't the guy (chef) at the end, the high end restaurant, sound Singaporean XD /v hey mate!

I am hoping for a small difference in your videos though, i am not a content creator so i have zero idea what it would mean monetarily wise but if possible this is my hope. I love the idea and the locations and diversity of the food experiences etc you know what you do, but what i always find myself wanting more of is a bit of you and your partners in crime experiencing a little more of the locales than going straight to the eateries. Not to get all patriotic but Melbourne has been voted most livable city in the world 7 times running, i would have loved to have seen just a little more of you guys experiencing the location as i love your personalities before going straight to shots of happy eating faces. I know its the premise of the show but it seems such an effort to travel so far and not show any footage of you enjoying the actual location as well as the food. Love your personalities and enthusiasm, try an unusual activity everywhere you go before you get to eating :) #BuzzFeedVideo #Worthit # VIDEOFACT   Everyone wants to see more of you guys /v Can buzzfeed not afford giving them both their own meal? /v Can you guys come over to NZ pls? /v Should have done it in new zealand we have way better sea food   /v They should have visited the Sydney fish market in 2021...

Dogshit cubed for sure. These movies only exist so that the twitards can still have something to cling to in there shitty vampire world. Fucking just kill them all please? That would make this franchise worth watching /v They should've kept it at one movie /v Dont understand how people like this shit /v Who are the kids, too\n /v The second one sucked so bad I can't imagine watching a 3rd one. Should have been a miniseries. You can't compress 500 pages down 2 hours of film. /v Can't wait to see how much this movie fucking sucks just like those other two piles of crap /v WHAT IN THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED /v So who gets raped this time? /v I've waited for a fucking long time for this!!!

Since i cant buy or rent the movie on google play coz my parents will know so... Imma just fucking wait) /v I've slept with a 100 guys, talk about rape culture a lot but love rape books and am a hypergamous, conceited bitch that wonders why I can't lock down a decent man - starter pack. /v Anastasia doesn't know how to act. /v Thank you for ruining Breaking Dawn part 1... oh well /v He dies at the end spoiler alert /v well this series took a weird turn into a murder thriller /v like 75% of women who will watch this will masturbate with cucumbers to this while in the Cinema /v After This Movies..there's a lot of Cucumber in Cinema's /v * I STILL SUBSCRIBE WITHOUT THE FILMS ANYWHERE ??? * /v Can't wait to see the movie  /v Cant wait for 50 shades of ur nan /v Plot twist: They get divorced later and she gets EVERYTHING /v I have no idea why people aren't going to the movies anymore.................no idea at all.............. /v Please let this die, you can tell the actors are miserable. /v So... this movie has about the same plot as the other two movies but with a slightly different name? You've ran out of ideas, STOP MAKING MOVIES. /v I want to see this movie for the action, not the gun or plane or motorcycle action, but the other action.  /v For everyone thats mad this is the final film don't worry /v Who elses panties are wet?

Hell, just go watch porn on your laptop at Starbucks with your beret and skinny latte. Fucking white people... /v When will it end? \nWhy is it recommended to me? Dafuq YouTube? /v Search pornhub for the better versions of this movie /v wait what really another one what is going on hAlP /v The only thing that I excited for is its OST.

Eso parece!!!! /v I love this franchise!!! BRING ON THE NEXT ONE /v -Romo stole both team's playbook /v I'm fapping to this shit /v He should be covering so many more games, you learn a whole lot more compared to the others who mostly just state the obvious. /v Romo absolutely killed it in his broadcasting debut /v BREAKING NEWS: Tony Romo expected to miss 4-6 weeks due to a sore throat. more on this subject as it becomes available. /v I need them lotto numbers /v how is he retired from the sport and still annoying the hell out of me. I can guess run, pass, slot aswell. Its not hard when you watch a lot of film. /v Did he predict dak taking his job ? /v A whole season's salary earned in one broadcast. /v 1:53 That was just spooky /v I hope he doesn't call a Cowboy game. Worried Cowboys fan /v For all those Romo haters from the past that said he was trash....this is what was going on in this guys head every week. He had your #. Future HOF commentator! /v I didn't like him as a player so much, LOVE him in the booth... the way he reacted and talked about the plays... he's not only an expert but a fan! /v This nigga need to be a coach or some shit. Help my bears cheat Romo please /v Tony gonna be a coach /v I could t stand him as a qb but damn he's a great commentator. Holy shit! /v This makes me a little sad, because if Tony's body could keep up with his mind he would have been a force to be reckoned with. /v Should become a defensive coordinator. /v I liked it when he asked What do you see here Tony? And Tony Romo calls the play to a Tee. /v Actually kinda ruins the suspense of what is going to happen. /v Tony is gonna be an amazing commentator! /v Joe Buck and TONY ROMO\nJim Nantz and TONY ROMO\nAl Michaels and TONY ROMO\nSean McDonough and TONY ROMO\nThis is how all broadcasting teams should be. /v Honestly don't know how you can hate the guy. He was a gunslinger and super fun to watch. Football is the ultimate team game can't be mad at him for not having a super bowl /v They can't have Romo as a commentator in Madden because he'd just tell the opponent the plays /v Breaking news Romo is out for 5 weeks  with a cold . /v needs to be a coach gd. /v Be cool if he could explain what he sees that makes him predict that stuff. It'd be like a John Madden that's actually useful! /v The real reason why they signed him is not only for his football knowledge but his golfing knowledge as well. Smart. /v Commentators who've interviewed him during his playing days compared his football I.Q. to that of Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. /v The NFL's official youtube page ripped off your video idea and almost copied it exactly, didn't even give any credit to you. /v they ran the ball on 3rd and 2 and blitzed on 3rd and 6 ? i've never seen anything like that, tony is so smart /v Why didnt he do the broncos and charger game on Monday night would been way better /v Horrible title. Why are we surprised that Tony Romo can still read plays? /v Damn, a 14 year quarterback reading plays. \nWHO WOULD OF THUNK? /v As an Eagles fan and proud Cowboys hater. I've always liked Romo, I like the Cowboys players ad people, they just never get respect for the team they play on. I have to say. Romo did an awesome job Sunday. /v Soon the coaches will be wired directly to Romo /v Been a Cowboy fan since the 70's and when I saw Tony was heading to to broadcast booth I told my wife he will be nothing short of fantastic! If you have ever sat back and just listened to him talk about activity on the field, ebb and flow of act and react things done just before the snap (remember how he'd audible consistently) you'd pick up really fast he's reading the field effortlessly...like a heady coach. Parcellls always said he's smart. But many could not see that. Well, now anyone who appreciates smart football will see for themselves. Here's the downside: now I probably need to get GameRewind because he's calling games in the AFC and I think it's brilliant the way he anticipates the action, so if I wanna see that I'll have to pay for it. I love this guy. The paradigm is about to shift on how to analyze live broadcast football. /v Tony is the type of guy that you watch a movie with and he tells you what happens before it happens. /v Toni Homo can suck a big dick... but that was pretty awesome. Finally found his calling /v Why do u start at 2 min left of the 4th? /v If Tony can predict all this, then why couldn't he predict Jessica Simpson becoming fat?  All the signs were there. /v The name Tony Romeo reminds of that funny ass Borderlands animation skit on YouTube  /v I remember Jason Witten saying Tony was a Savant when it came to reading coverages know I get it /v 49ers fan here, Would have liked to see Tony compete these last couple years for a SuperBowl but I'm happy for him. He's taken too much punishment through the years but he's making for a great commentator as well. /v This play is my favorite play. I like is very much.\nHere is some related post https://goo.gl/tdW1R8 /v Tony is the Man fuck all Tony haters y'all faggots don't know shit about football if y'all don't know that Tony going in the hall of fame and he was did his best for the cowboys with what he had it's not fair that Dak just got lucky and got handed the best cowboy team that Tony built finally we get a team together and then he got fucked oh well that's life but iam happy for him he's a real Man he said fuck it and Gave LISTEN CLEARLY yes I said Gave because that is his team let's make it very Clear he didn't have to sit out at anytime he could of said iam ready to go back in sit your ass down boyeee....but that shows he's the Man and loves the team first before himself so FUCK ALL COWBOY AND TONY HATERS. /v What if he calls a playoff game and starts choking on his own spit, this is coming from a Romo fan. /v This is some new kind of broadcasting... someone that knows his shit  /v Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how robot augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23 /v He was a qb. He knows the plays /v Imagine if he was a safety bruh /v Made by Jack Fritz on Twitter! /v I watched the game and he did a great job commentating /v Second note...Amari Cooper only catches difficult passes not the easy ones apparently. If you own him in fantasy trade him for Golden Tate or Doug Baldwin before the rest of your league figures it out as well. atleast those guys will catch the ball and have YAC ( btw i freaking hate Doug Baldwin he's not a #1 receiver) /v Dam he knew all this and still couldn't get it done in the field smh haha /v That's my quarterback! Wouldn't mind if he came back to be the QB's coach for Dallas. /v Not a psychic, just an elite QB with fantastic football knowledge. And I'm an eagles fan /v He's not psychic, Romo's just an experienced QB. He knows all of these plays. /v What is this game? /v Hope he's part of every raider game! Tony's awesome /v Kind of feel bad for Tony. Talent and smarts but couldn't stay healthy. /v Don't ever watch a game of thrones episode with Tony /v Makes me wonder how Cutler would've been lol /v gotta get used to it  /v As an Eagles fan, Romo was fantastic in the booth /v No homo, but I love Romo /v I was skeptical but I thoroughly enjoyed Tony calling this game, got a feeling he is going to be pretty good at this. /v This is better than the usual, The team that scores more should win the game. /v go raiders but tony did a really good job in his first broadcasting game /v Now that romo is retired, I think we can all agree, despite being brittle, he was a very good qb, he is a stand up guy, and he seems to be a great commentator. Id love to see him call a packer game any day. /v Do you have express written consent of the nfl? /v Still can't compete with the legend Sergio dipp /v I think he did good but I wouldnt say the guy said anything that was just jaw-dropping. Gee, Oakland is up and has the ball right now. Probably gonna be a run Rookie kicker makes two 52-yd field goals, gee after seeing him make 2 harder ones earlier 9 yards closer should be more of a centered kick for sure! /v This was a topic on a sports radio show today.  They said, and I agree he knows this cuz he's been a QB in the league for over a decade so it's like a cheap parlor trick.  It's cool but it gets old fast.  Kill kill kill is an obvious audible, usually to a run.  It's his job to be analyze why the play happened.  Maybe say they're running left because they saw the safety walking up to the right side.  Not hating.  I like Romo /v To bad that didn't win the cowboys a super bowl. Smh. /v I GOT A NEW RESPECT FOR ROMO, I Love This, That's That QB Mind N It's So Sharp! /v This just shows you how scripted the NFL has become. /v I'm actually proud my last name is Romo /v Great job Tony. Those predictions bring a different dynamic to the booth /v Money pal money /v Phil simms who ? /v The GOAT /v Man...love this commentary by Romo! /v Future super bowl coach. /v NFL copied this channel. /v Hey something Tony romo don't suck at. /v Wow that was awesome! /v Tony homo /v OMG...he's Stephen FUCKING Hawkings !!!!   (sarcasm: off) /v Next Madden commentator please /v GOLD /v Bill belichik told him /v tony did awesome.  /v Tony romo for madden 19 commentator /v Imma start watching games for tony romo /v https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuA6NXfSZePanlqpxJJtxSw?sub_confirmation=1 /v Really? Anybody who's watched or played the game can see this stuff. Overloaded to one side = probably gonna run that way.  And for my money, I'd bargain that Romo was fed some of those calls just to increase the hype.  He was that good in the booth but couldn't deliver on the field. But folks are calling him Nostradamus now? Lol /v Tony romo hardest working Mexican in tv broadcasting. Cant believe trump hates romos kind /v After watching my Broncos win tonight's MTF with the boring as hell commentators. Tony Romo and John Gruden will great together /v Too bad he couldn't predict how bad a quarterback he would be. /v Best first look video. Can't believe big site like engadget filming their first look on a phone, out of focus all the time. You delivered proper first look :) /v I'm getting this phone for sure! /v i thing samsung is fucked right now... /v Rip samsung S8 /v Wont the video look weird on this phone with that top annoyance? /v Please cancel the iphone 8 releasing and release the iphone X insted! /v https://plexcoin.tech/?ref=sihQolPZ9j\nI HAVE alrerady invested 1000 $ to this coin if you register through this link you ''ll get 5% bonus plexcoin coin have already been sold  36,283,300.35454368 PLX more than 108 000 particapate in this project now is the presale time you can buy coins through debit card or paypal, credit card , ethereum, litecoin , bitcoin depends on you 1 coin price is 0,13 $ after presale one of it will be 1,76 $ prediction is after end of year one of its price will be 5 $ plexcoin will be next bitcoin hurry up for buying your coins           Note: 1 coin will be $ 0.13 that first day.

I just wonder if it can also do 'bokeh' shots with the front camera, though. Huawei's P10/Plus front camera Portrait Mode can do that artificially (front camera's just a single lens module), and I think iPhone should be able to do that better (due to better 3D depth detection tech?), based from this walkthrough. /v Say thank you to Samsung for that great AMOLED DISPLAY that Apple ordered.. /v I wanted an s8 but after seeing this I definitely want this more /v How can I unluck my phone if I have no face? *_* /v Steve Jobs once said to start with the customer experience and work back to the technology.

The buildings designed by these star-chitect are amazing but as you are walking through a city/town the smallest details of what could be a normal building has so much to say about its history. Love your videos and congrats on 1M!! /v great photos iam fan of your photos /v Peter - what hat are you wearing today? /v you make great videos keep it up /v Awesome content Pete!

Would have loved to try some of your angles, but I think I got some decent pics nonetheless :) Thanks for the inspiration, as always! /v I can see the mystery box behind you.\nIt will be mystery for all of us too.\nWhen you r going to open it  /v Hey Peter! I just wanted to say that you're so awesome and really inspire me to be a better photographer. /v Don't forget to look up! Those are words I have lived by for a long time! /v Toronto!

You are Awesome dude !!!!! /v Hi Peter,\nI am new here watching you. You made a wonderful video. I like it very much. I like to know one more things which is what happened to your hand I saw lot's of scratches there. Would you like to share of this experience /v A video that I have been waitin.....Finally now ! Thanks Pete ! /v Thanks for this video! It was really helpful, i personally do a lot of nature and landscape and especially macro photography and so it always was super difficult for me to take a good architecture shot. So this really helped. :) /v Peter or anyone. When you are taking photos in a the city...have you ever come across security and how do you deal with them? /v Haha I once went to the Fujitsu Towers in Munich and we were taking pictures of that impressive building when a security guard ran to the closed door right beside us. He waved at us and we thought that he wants to be photographed. So... I took a picture of him. He then opened the door and shouted at us that it is only allowed to shoot on that ground with an permission from the company.  He then forced us to delete the whole sd card with all of our wonderful shots. Lol. Fuck that guy. We then ran away and got amazinh pictures. /v Wow, this is definitely going to help me get some awesome photos for my design photography assignment. Thanks for sharing. /v 1:21: Resident Evil: Apocalypse :D\nI know, I know... guilty pleasure. /v Thanks for creating this!! Shooting for yourself and for a client can be totally different but I'm working on changing that too.  It's not an easy field of photography to get into either. I am going to try and discuss all of this as I attempt a 100 days of hustle for the end of the year.  Might love to connect in Toronto at some point around this topic - one day when I have more than 25 subs eh? LOLLLLLLLLL /v Thank you very much.

It's very inspiring. Keep it up. /v When I travel, I often use a wheelchair, and have help with the pushing, which means not only do I get a very unique perspective / vantage point to view cities from, but also the time to look around / look up while getting pushed around! It has made for some great shots over the years. /v Now i understand, thanks man! /v It would be the Sydney Harbour Bridge...but it was a boring post card shot...but after watching your inspirational video...i neeeed to revisit this aussie icon and give it the wow factor....thx... /v what happened to your hand? /v Cheers for the two minutes, mate! Been using your videos to push myself with my own work, and now I've got something completely new to try out on my weekend shoots! \n\nI even bought your presets (and subscribed to LR for the first time) and I'm enjoying playing around with them - I've yet to really use one for a published photo, but I have used them to get some good ideas for how I want to edit an image, and have been getting some great results, so again, cheers! /v we all know wat that means /v Something to try but the problem is we don't have many buildings around in India. /v What are u thinking about Iphone X? /v NASA hq, yes please  love that /v helped a a lot.  thanks pet. love from Bangladesh.

Peter /v dude you are good /v whoah.... just.... whoah.... Peter McKinnon gives me energy /v  /v I love ur work /v Great help! /v Sweetssss /v 'Bwatsapp' /v Nice. /v I hope this wins Best Picture just for the fact that they might bring Tommy up on stage for it /v James Franco on being Tommy: I did a bunch of weird shit listening to tapes and watching footage from filming. \nDave on becoming Greg: We(Greg and I) had sushi and talked for 3 hours. /v Has Tommy ever released a Behind the Scenes of The Room, with all this footage being mentioned? /v 3:47 marry someone who looks at you like the way he looks at tommy /v Random fact: Tommy Wiseau is actually James Franco in the future. He came back in time with his future money to make The Room, and then help with The Disaster Artist, the funds from which he used to make his millions that in the future allowed him to travel back in time to fund The Room and...well, if you've seen any of the Terminator films, you get it... /v Franco's mocking and talking down to Tommy.  Greg Sestero does a much better impression of Wiseau in the audio book to be honest. /v You're tearing me apart Franco /v Shouldve gotten Mark Damon...sorry Matt Damon to play Mark /v Mark should have played himself,He's barely aged a day /v I had no idea Franco was such an unrivalled dickhead. /v in a few minutes bitch /v This is a great insight from the interview, very dense, their chemistry is so energetic, and Franco seems most mature, sincere and happy. He diffused Tommy's nervousness so easily, it's like he knows him better than Tommy does. No doubt that they did justice to the characters. /v I really don't get why people hate James Franco. He makes odd career choices sometimes with all his indie shit but he seems like a really great guy... loving the deuce and can't wait for this /v Tommy Looks Like he just got out of a hospital on Guerrero Street /v I like Tommy and think Franco's a dickhead but doesn't Tommy seem coked up? /v Greg is still hot as fuck. /v I'm looking forward to this movie. It doesn't look they're just making fun of him, it's seems to have a lot of heart. I hope it delivers /v Does Tommy knows that he's horrible? /v I'm pretty sure Greg could've played Greg. He still looks very young /v Tommy Wiseau makes James Franco look, for a lack of a better word, normal? /v 4:37 come on Franco why have to put him on the spot like that? LMAO /v James Franco is really taking some leg space /v Look at James man spreading /v Feels weird listening to wiseau without his voice sounding over dubbed like in the movie /v Franco's legs are wide open AF everyone else looks awkward. /v The way the camera movement...I really like it!\nThe camera movement? The camera don't move.\n\nClassic Wiseau moment right there! :D /v Why is he doing his voice at him!? /v James is half way stuck in the ascent /v James Franco imitates that way Tommy speaks at times /v Franco can't help talking like Tommy /v James is honestly sort of a douche in this interview, you can tell Tommy is just going with the flow, but is probably a little pissed. Either way I still have to see this film. /v It looks like he's right there but we all know Tommy Wiseau is on another planet. /v Here it is... you want to watch... the definitive critique of The Room as Oedipus Rex. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs20YlgvvYk /v Leave your stupid comments in your pocket! /v Tommy speaks so funny that end omg.. my favourite part is the swimming pool scene\nReally? Its so random\nYeah I like it. I like the camera movement in there\nCamera movement? The camera doesn't move..  /v James is a fucking douche /v granted I've still never seen The Room (I definitely will before I see this), but is Wiseau in just like an epic case of denial that he made what's regarded as one of the worst films ever? Does he even realize people think that? or he does, but he genuinely believes deep in his heart that EVERYONE is wrong and it's a quality film and he's a good actor? /v I'm so happy that Tommy feel joy about this film been made! /v Tommy might have a little bit of dementia. /v Tommy is such a lovely guy /v Why is there spit on Tommy's chin /v I know he has a cameo, he should be the flower shop worker /v Having watch the trailers, I have to say that Franco pretty much nailed Tommy's persona /v Tommy can't fit on the couch. /v Franco has an epic man-spread. Taking up half the couch /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Wow. Tommy Wiseau actually saw James Franco in Sonny. That's dedication. lol /v The camera don't move. LOL /v Its so wierd how James still cant get away from the voice of Tommy, just listen to some of the sentences and words he use in this interview :D /v It's fucking wholesome and adorable, this video. Franco is still talking like Wiseau. Waaat. that's so rahndom /v I don't know if I have ever loved anyone as much as I love Tommy Wiseau. /v I do love how Franco isn't taking any of Tommy's shit. I mean, look at his legs. He's all spread out and Tommy is crammed into the side there. Tommy couldn't have liked that. /v It's nice to see Tommy has seemingly warmed up to the guys and the press for this film. At the start it was so obvious he didn't like it and didn't want to be there. /v Tommy seems like a decent guy and its pretty awesome theyre all friends now /v Tommy's being such a good sport about this. /v I've never seen Tommy Wiseau this normal, it's unusual. He's usually saying nonsense. /v Franco is talking to Wiseau in his native tongue lmao /v I love how Tommy has such weird answers for everything here I now understand why he thought the room was a good idea /v I would kill to see the behind the scenes footage that Markus shot. /v James is still subtly talking like Tommy. /v Super excited for the movie but it's still kind of sad to see Tommy involved in this. I still thinks he believes that his art is good. I get he's fearless and HE is interesting, but his art is NOT good . I really don't think he gets that diaster artist is making fun of his art, not celebrating it. It's like the kid who has a sign on his back and everyone is looking at him but he doesn't get why. /v I love how Tommy actually wants this movie to be made and is just loving every second of it XD /v Wow, this is almost akin to Windy City Heat. /v Tommy thinks a handsome guy like James Franco is perfect because in his mind that's what he looks like. /v Lets just say agreeing with franco moved him.......TO A BIGGER HOUSE /v The Like to Dislike ratio for this video is one of the best I've ever seen. /v please release it today!!! /v Tommy is an absolute treasure. /v Is tommy like proud of his disaster? Like this movie is making fun of him /v Franco drops his articles of speech to gain street cred with Tommy /v Tommy Wiseau still thinks this is all absolutely serious. He thinks they praise his movie thats why they did a movie based on how the Tommy Wiseaus movie was made. lol... dont know what to think honestly. /v Franco is going to be talking like Tommy for years after doing it for so long. When he talks to Tommy, his sentence structure changes to be just like Tommy's. /v I don't get it....is this guy like Sasha Borat?? Lolol /v Why is Tommy's chin so wet, is he drooling? /v Tommy's like this Bob Dylan-esque rock star now. To me, The Disaster Artist is a much more lyrical title than 'I'm Not There'. Yet Dylan's career is more 'The Disaster Artist' in terms of making a name for himself. And Tommy's more the 'I'm Not There' in that he has this coolness that removes himself from his bad movie. More mystique about Tommy than Bob I'd say - whether rightfully or wrongly, that's the paradox. /v Calling it now , it will win an oscar and Wiseau will be given the oscar. It will be amazing /v This is so fucking awkward  /v Also, James Franco close your god damn legs and give that poor old man some god damn room! /v Greg is radiant. My god why didn't they cast him in the film as Greg? /v His hair looks like a donut. /v Franco should've been dressed like Tommy lol /v So great /v Hah hah Hah /v Why isn't Greg talking? /v Directed by Nicholas cage... /v This is money! /v Franco is manspreading /v That is some indulging manspread /v Franco looks normal  compared to tommy lol. /v Dave looks sooo tiny /v tommys lookin like michael jackson rn /v watevur move on next question. /v Oh hi, Marcus. /v Stop ganging up on me  /v wtf with Franco manspreading, poor Tommy... close your legs stupidaaaaassss /v The Room came out 15 years ago and Tommy hasnt improved his English at all. haha /v SREN PILMARK !!!! Hey every Danish person watching, LOOK, IT'S SREN PILMARK :D /v The original Mark was supposed to be black. /v After seeing The Room and read The Disaster Artist, it is so good to see Tommy, finally on that level. Hanging ou with actual Hollyood stars. /v The worse artist playing the worse artist! Spot on! /v Graduation and late registration his best albums /v Don't act like I never told ya /v 808's changed music more tho /v Anyone weird enough to like fish dicks is bound to be considered eccentric thus genius by the average person.\nAlso, no genius would marry a Kardashian or leave an insurmountable volume of shit that comes out of his mouth aka brain. /v Nawll this the real Kanye west back in the days the one I loved now he then branched off went from Jesus walk with me to thinking his God nooooooo wrong move praying for u brother  /v High School Train Rides .. Good Ol Days.. Damn, we all get old before you know it.. /v Glad to see Ye finally getting the recognition for his greatness that he deserves. /v Champion is my most favorite song /v I just don't get this music at all. /v I fucking love this album /v FINALLY GENIUS IS TRENDING. And where the hell is Letty we're annoyed now :( /v I love this album and enjoyed the video but I didn't catch the part where they described how music was changed by it. /v Scrollin through these comments and not one mentions Champion! Easily one of Kanye's most underrated songs damn /v The best Kanye album in my opinion. /v Get the fuck out of here ....Changed music my fuckin Ass....Kanye is a piece of shit. Hip Hop is Bullshit. Rap is mindless bullshit. Take away auto-tune. Take  away Lyrics about violence , money, and whores.....wtf are u left with.....NOTHING!!!! /v Would the Kayne of the past think of the Kayne of today has having gone south in his career and mental health? /v Kanye hasn't made a good song since College Drop out. He stinks now. Half retarded because of Kardashian Syndrome /v I'll stick to Pac and all the old shit /v No college dropout changed music. Graduation adapted to change into the music that you here today. But college dropout was the catalyst to everything. /v This change anything he is just another nigger /v There's a lot of Kanye dick riders here that obviously know nothing about hip hop /v No it didn't /v Am i the only one who like Barry Bonds ? /v Changed music??? Give me a break, give one solid example of how it changed music. /v Unfortunately Kanye and Wayne different versions of hip hope and rap has lead to the mumble crap we see today with nothing but beats and autotune carrying entire wongs /v The dude is a musical genius, i just wish he wasnt an egotistical, autistic, arrogant piece of shit human being yah know? /v Does anyone else notice Kanye's jacket in the vid look like the black parade jackets /v Just gonna say it's refreshing to see a YouTube comment section where people aren't shitting on Kanye. Y'all wavy. /v This is a nice format! Can Genius have a channel for rock & metal? /v lmao when's he gonna get lil wayne to play guitar on his album? /v I know God put you infront of me .How the hell could you front on me ?!! /v i was lowkey sad when it ended hahaha i was interested in what they had to say for post graduation /v I have problem choosing wether Graduation or 808 and Heartbreaks to be my favorite album /v Thank you for this. Thank Kanye for all of this. /v I miss the old kanye\nChop up the beats kanye. /v Graduation is great, but id didn't change music, 808's and heartbreak did, /v My favorites are Champion and Glory. Stronger is overrated /v Genius has a YouTube channel?? How did I not know this before today! Subscribed  /v everything i'm not made me everything i am  /v I think the biggest effect Kanye West ever had on my life was that he showed me there was in fact, actually one person on this earth I actually despise more than Taylor Swift. Then Beyonce just kinda shrugged him off and congratulated Taylor Swift. I see why so many people like Beyonce, she is a class act. Still don't get why so many like the other 2 though... /v I bought a CD back in 2007 for the cover and kept it for the music. /v I wanna see one of this for every album, specially for mldtf /v I thought thay meant that they played his music at an Graduation.... /v Forget the new kanye i need old kanye /v His sampling game on point /v Pfffft. /v I miss old Kanye /v Spoilers: it didn't change music /v #46 on trending? it's LIT /v I miss stronger /v tell me this man doesnt look like swoozie lol /v Flashing lights is my favorite!! /v good times /v I love stronger, really inspirational /v Chief Keef changed music /v He Sucks /v faster stronger /v Touch it or uhhhh technologic??? /v This is awesome /v i still hate kanye west /v AND I WONDER.. /v shoutout to daft punk /v You already know /v Still listen daily /v 50 on trending /v Yall copies Pitchforks video /v kayne is an asshole and he sucks. /v Who is Kanye? /v Kanye West helped keep hip hop alive! /v This album gives me life. /v Its so true /v Great way to see if you can talk music with someone. Ask them if they think Kanye West is one of the greats artist of our time. If they say no dont talk to them LOL /v Can't tell me nothing and champion... Middle school jams /v Say what you want about Ye but I stan him HAAAARD /v kanye always seems to impress me, because you go back to any other album from 07 you can clearly hear the age of it. graduation isn't that way. same for 808's. /v the greatest artist of the 21st century /v For the 2010s, the top 5 most influential and culture changing albums/projects in no particular order are My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Take Care, House of Balloons, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and Channel Orange. Changed music as a whole. /v Top 5 Kanye art:\n1.graduation\n2.808's and heartbreak\n3.college dropout\n4.my beautiful dark twisted fantasy \n5.watch the throne /v To this day kanye's most overlooked and underrated album. /v Kanye was light years before his time. Everything being produced now he did almost half a decade ago. Kanye is the GOAT /v Kanye West is the greatest ARTIST of the 21st century /v Kanye was the core of hip hop in the 2000s. His creativity literally changed the game. Like, what fucking rapper in 2007 would collab with Chris Martin? All his songs on Graduation are GOLD for that time /v Kanye West is the goat and there's no dispute /v When this album came out, it never left my car's CD player for over 7 months. The fact that he made the beats made the songs more appreciative. /v Man that album was awesome /v Everyone always ignores The Glory, that was my favorite song in the album. /v Greatest artist of the past 20 years /v 1. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy \n2. The College Dropout \n3. Graduation \n4. Late Registration \n5. The Life of Pablo \n6. 808's & Heartbreak\n7.  Yeezus \n\nMy Personal Taste \n\n1. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy \n2. Graduation\n3. The Life of Pablo\n4. Late Registration \n5. The College Dropout\n6. Yeezus \n7. 808's and Heartbreak /v yes he is extremely talented, but he doesn't have to be so smug about it. I just wish he would just tone down his narcissistic tendencies and just be himself for a change. I don't. hate Kanye West for I am a secretly a huge fan of  his music. /v One of my favorite albums definitely a classic  hes the   GOAT ... lyrically top 5 /v I listen to all that trap shit now days. But it's something special when I can listen to a bunch of bull shit and the only real hip hop I have on my phone is Kanye West albums all the way up to run away. His messages in his songs are so real man. I'm a truck driver, so I'll put it on shuffle and my whole day will change emotionally. Also I have Lauren Hill, Eryka Badu, some floetry, etc.... I love good music. But now days it's dying to me. /v Graduation is still my favorite Kanye album...amazing front to back /v Genius >Complex /v 808's and heartbreak I think really changed the game. And kinda paved the way to bring about a lot of the artist we have today. /v Big brother  /v YEEZY  /v Insane album /v Flashing lights my favorite kanye song! /v true artist /v Absolute classic. Beautiful album. /v From all the videos not one person did a size comparison with this phone. /v Good job Apple... you have played the oldest trick in the salesman's book. Create an alternative phone thats more  special, more expensive, more exclusive, more Apple vs an already outdated looking Iphone 8. That way all the technologically impaired, trend following sheep will have no choice but to pay 1K for a cellphone in order to remain relevant in within their pathetic social circles. It's all about the brand. /v Corner to corner display doesnt look as awesome when you have a whole bar up there. Oh well at least those do a lot of heavy duty face processing for portrait and depth separation . /v what do you mean if you press the middle of the screen you can unlock it? This is confusing me a lot /v Fandroids more toxic than botulinum toxin aka botox. /v 0:30 isnt that this one german Youtuber Alexi Bexi? /v That display is the most beautiful display I have ever seen on a phone. Good Job Apple. /v Steve jobs is spinning in his GRAVE and saying These today's apple products don't have sex in them. /v That's.. really ugly.. going to be plain honest, that looks really fucking ugly. /v The only thing that doesn't look good to me it's the thickness of the bezel. /v or should i get a macbook /v Here they goes... again.. apple fans boy versus samalsung mania.. craapppppp /v i am going to pre order /v Looks amazing but I prefer Samsung s8 /v 1. horrible camera hump \n2. no fingerprint scanner \n3. super retina w-wut \n4. $999 \n5. no usb type c or 3.5mm headphone port /v I'm confused. So Apple made a Samsung Galaxy and just added in technology that Samsung already had. Lol. /v The thing ugly, especially from the back. /v @mkbhd #mkbhd I see your hands at 2:07 who agrees. /v Gimmicks...... /v Wow looks great! /v if you pay $1000 for any phone,  you need slapped.  And yes I had the very first iPhone in 2007. when it started at $700 and I was stupid. /v S8 is a lot sexier then this piece of crap... /v i only wanted 1 feature, multi-tasking/multiwindow applications.. and once again apple let me down. even iPad has this feature now.. i dont get why apple hasn't included it to iphone. /v 2-3GBs of ram says it all. Animated emojis over the age of 10 says you are crazy. /v I love the idea that he has been having all of these adventures.. with his shoes untied. /v You're starting to grow man. Been here since Dolan Dark memed your swimming video. /v I think it would be amazing if the duct taped shoes remained in continuity that way for the entirety of the rest of the videos. /v HowToBasic meets AlanTutorial /v I watch you since your first video on your channel - since you had no more than 10 subs - I hope I can be with your journey for a longer time and see how your channel grows :3 /v You idiot you dropped your plant /v i liked your other videos but not this one /v I love how you take the most mundane things and turn them into something fun. /v You're like the guy from the infomercials who fails the easiest tasks: Are you tired of struggling with <easy thing>?. Great videos dude. /v Not sure if you've heard of it, but there's this video site called YouTube, where you can probably look up how to tie your shoes. It'll\nshow you step by step. Get it? Step? Shoes? I'll go home. /v do Cutting Paper\nEating a Burger\nDoing a homework\n\n- (Requesting for a month now) /v I hope you do more something goes wrong soon instead of you getting really weird with how you do X, I miss mishaps like when you tried learning to swim or played with a frisbee /v This was the best integration of a SquareSpace sponsored video ever!!!!! /v Aww man, I wanted it to escalate higher... Like it thought he would accidentally tie his hands together, or try to use an industrial staple gun with the shoe on his foot and start bleeding and have a cast, and then try to put the shoe over the cast. Or rip the laces and try to use a bunch of rope from the garage to tie the shoe. Or use the duct tape but put it sticky side out and get it stuck to everything in the house, forcing him to make a shoe tying machine that goes bazerk and ties everything in his house into bows... Or something on that level... /v Liked cause I seen Air Forces /v HEY! I never said you could use my failed shoe tying tutorial for a video! /v @Buttered Side Down. Second damn, Do you like overwatch? I think you should listen to my songs :). youtube com/XimerTracks /v You are going to go far my friend. /v Alright, instructions followed, now how do I take them off? /v It would have been cool if after all of that he realized he put them on the wrong feet. :D /v ROFL. My kid is 26 and still can't tie his own shoes. /v I was expecting the shoes to explode or something, but alright he nailed it. /v He caught the run-away plant! /v You are the GOD of crazy /v Didn't actually expect whatishappeningtome.com to be real, it is. /v this channel is Similar to how to basic channel but way better and less Disgusting /v He really dedicates a lot of time/money for these videos. Bought a plant and broke it immediately in his house and had to clean it up. Then he completely ruined 2 pairs of shoes and wasted tape. (I mean wasting tape isn't that serious but still) Definitely a great channel and I'm glad that I found you. Keep up the great work! :) /v He's overrated. Don't deny this- you know it's true. /v This is probably the happiest ending I've seen in one of his videos so far. /v I have a strong hung this guy's April Fools video will be Making Scrambled Eggs and will be a completely normal video of him making eggs. /v 016 everyone did that at one point /v He made ads entertaining...\n\nLet me repeat that\n\n\n\n*HE MADE ADS ENTERTAINING* /v I like The Effort Keep up the Videos man /v I knew it. I absolutely knew tying his shoes would become a subject at one point. Just surprised he didn't injure himself worse yet. /v Wait, hold on. Are those Air Force 1s? I didn't know they still made those. I wore them in the 5th grade. Damn. /v Did you try turning your shoes on and off first? /v You can't tie a shoe but you can tie the string to the needle lol /v Was expecting a dark twist... /v I love how the website at the end looks like something from 15 years ago. I guess it's a shity website maker. /v I found this one a bit lacking, There aren't any effects. /v That's the most elegant ad that I've ever seen. /v Make a short about traveling back in time, but constantly going to the wrong dates, like around dinosaurs and such. /v Making a Face reveal video, but you can't turn around the gopro or camera. (Lenny) /v You clearly have internet access because we see you using Squarespace, so why don't you just Google it? /v Stop sounding like how to basics....good content...could be more original grunting!? :/ /v I like that you are willing to make such a mess in your house for the sake of your videos. /v Or, you could just not wear your shoes indoors haha /v I love your channel!!!!!  /v Keep on dude, I f* love your stuff, and clever way to add the advertisement ;D \nLike it <3 /v I love that you put content into the sponsor too! /v No, no, man. You're doing it all wrong.\n\nYou do a loop-de-loop and pull, then your shoes are lookin' cool! /v I expected him to go for a walk after putting duct tape on his legs, and walk into a building with a no shoes sign! /v We need more creative and original creators like you. Wish you were more well known  /v HA YOU CANT TIE YOUR SHOES THAT MEANS YOU'RE STUPID HA HA /v For those who don't know, the website at the end is real. It's whatishappeningtome.com . /v Idk whats more impressive, the fact he cant tie shoes, or the knots he makes when he messed up /v While still good, I think episodes are getting more lame on the way. If you have to take more time for original ideas, please do. Twice a month is fine as well. Good luck on your endeavors :) /v Wait. He couldn't just slip on the already-tied green shoes? xD /v I legit thought of you making a video on this topic on Thursday XD /v Love that he can't tie his shoes but knows how to sew the laces together /v That was a nice pot that he broke /v Shoes with laces\n\n\n\n\n\nShould go to hell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE THEY CAME /v How everyone feel when they were kids /v A while back I saw this on creators on the rise, I watched one video and couldn't stop. This is great channel. If you dont reach 100k or even a million, its just because people don't know about ur channel. Imma spread your channel around YouTube. I hope you have a great day :D /v Wow no eggs this time  /v 1:23 GIVE THIS MAN AN AWARD!!! HES THE WORLDS FASTEST TYPER!! /v Anybody else find it hilarious the he perfectly got the thread in the needle. Irony. /v I'm from brazil, i love you man /v love the ad placement, very creative and entertaining way to include it. /v fuck squarespace /v https://www.whatishappeningtome.com/ /v When in doubt, duct. /v Even the sponsers are so awesome /v Duct tape solves anything! /v Damn quality content /v *Wtf is that computer??* /v 381st like. Yay I guess. /v Opening a Boiled egg /v Fishing /v noice /v Next time try Valium 10  /v Fucking awesome hehe /v  /v Velcro? /v Rip *Potty the Potted Plant* /v Duck tape.

XD. /v He's a clown /v All I know is that Pennywise is such an awesome band. /v I gave Jenny a thumbs up for the massive list of credits at the end, amazing :)  Your humor is top notch /v I love you Jenny /v penny wise & pound foolish. no one needs to know this tripe. learn to read a real book like The Way of All Flesh. /v Funny how? Like I'm a clown, I amuse you? They shoulda gotten Joe Pesci to play Pennywise. They coulda had him beat some kid to death with a shinebox. /v I wish she could make a movie, so I can try really, really hard to make a sarcastic video about it...... /v Ok, this is my favorite Jenny video by a wide margin. Her, I guess you'd call it trademark almost bored tone made describing a killer clown the funniest thing I'm likely to watch today. It's 7am and I've already hit my funny peak. /v From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic. /v Is clown college still a thing? \n\nCLM /v It was more of a comedy then a horror movie honestly /v When the patreon credits came up.... WHOA!  O_O /v IT and a Turtle are Mortal Enemies. /v This video was ripe for clown-nose wearing potential.  Wasted. /v what the hell was that the vietnam wall memorial for the ending ?\nwtf was that x) /v What are you afraid of Jenny? /v I heard this theory that hes a clown because pennywise the identity, is of a serial killer like John Wayne gasey in that universe. Because all of the forms he takes are of preexisting entities, like Beverlys Dad or the lumberjack statue or the flute painting or Georgie /v For once, I completely agree with this lady. Pennywise was not scary, and IT was very disappointing. /v Where is the giant porg!? /v The sausagefest that is your patreon account is always the best piece of comedy in your videos /v What if he went across monkey bars whilst upside down... like all gravity defying like? /v So, like a crocodile, Pennywise is an ambush predator. ;) /v You're very pretty in glasses /v You're so pretty. /v Just admit to us that you like being a clown haha, I can imagine him sitting there with a sad clown face when they say that to him. /v my god what happened to your porg! it shrunk! /v Pennywise was scared of the Losers because he knew they had the power to kill him if they stuck together, so he wanted Henry to kill some of them first /v My goodness you are attractive /v as glad as i was when you went over to screen junkies just in hopes you'd make some money off your work, these are by far you best videos.  millennial falcon is great but i'm interested in hearing what you have to say on more than the one topic. /v 3:13 He can dance if he wants to.  He can leave his friends behind.  Because his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine.\n\n*safety dances out of the comment section* /v I am so glad you did a video about the film! I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie. /v You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better /v I never cared for Pennywise the band /v With the final confrontation with Pennywise they should have played a song from Queen. /v I've always felt that the deadites from the Evil Dead franchise feed off of fear as well, that to them it's a kind of art. Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk. /v Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though /v You're braver than I. I was not going to watch a killer clown movie. /v Hey. Jenny. You. Are. Beautiful. And. Clever. :) /v 4:10 o my goodness i didnt even think in that scene that way, now thats the only way ill think of it now. I HATE U FOR THIS /v The clown, not the punk rock band /v A big spider huh....thats an interesting notion ;] /v Why is that porg so tiny?! /v Nah, penny wise says beep beep to Richie as a reference to the book. The kids used beep beep as an indicator for Richie to stop running his mouth yeah? /v I'm sorrythat was a great videobut the camera wasn't set right. /v Jennys hair looks like she got shes all that-ed right before she started shooting where she took off her glasses and shook down her hair in slowmo....but then couldnt see so she had to put the glasses back on /v i always figured that the more fear a kid experiences the more the fear flavor builds inside them. Like how adrenaline makes animals taste gamey. /v I was just picturing Pennywise telling the Crimson King he was going to take the form of a Clown. /v Do more stars wars erotica fan fiction. /v Ok well now I feel like a total idiot for liking the movie. Thanks Jenny. /v I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even! /v it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over! /v I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol /v In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster. /v There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown. /v YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this /v holy fuck was she bit in the face by a dog when she was a kid or something? /v I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign. /v Never trust a man with large shoes.. \n\n\n.. my dad put on his size 11's and walked out on us /v Look, someone who didn't read the book. How could this very simple concept of a movie elude you? My 9 year old kept up, I thought you were intelligent... Or is that just what you keep wanting us to think that? Also, 42 percent of people are afraid of clowns. And pennywise got greedy and wanted all those kids and he built up their fear for too long. Clearly to his down fall... Do you even pay attention to the movies you watch or just pick up shit you wanna bitch about to be a hipster? /v Hey! This was fun. I'm curious, did you enjoy the movie? /v Honestly, if I hadn't read the book and had only seen the movie, I wouldn't give a shit about who the kids were and what happened to them. Like the movie was 2 hours long and we barely learned anything about our main characters. /v Just watched the 90s version.  The talking head in the fridge, shaking and yelling WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE! was a reoccurring thing in my childhood nightmares.  Looking forward to the new film. /v Soooooo, did you like it? /v YES! My biggest problem with most horror movies is how illogically the murderers behave. Why would you toy with your victims in a way that implies there is an audience watching? Unless......are the monsters aware of us, the moviegoers? Is Pennywise's food actually our approval as the audience? Dun dun dun!!! /v Deadpan, deeply perceptive, ironic, hilarious and very clever. Not sure if we deserve you, Jenny (meant in a good way). /v This movie was great though /v What are you looking for is reference to which pill was Eddie looking for. /v I'm new here /v I thought you were going to talk about punk rock. Gotta be honest, I'm a little disappointed. :( /v OMG, the guy is trying, give him a break! /v Love the kitty outfit! Also, I hate clowns because of Pennywise. /v Clown doing upper body work = not scary, clown on leg day = scary. /v He prolongs the scares because he's intimidated by the group. 7 being a number of significance, he can't get through to them like he can with Georgie who was alone /v Also he sees ur fear cause he has telepathy (he is a alien) /v i see you washed that porg and it shrunk down to a managable size. /v So everything from this point back is Pre-Porg. You can tell by the hollow and soulless look in her eyes. /v I know nothing about any sci-fi but i find her delivery so funny that she is one of 5 youtube subscriptions i have. /v Oh how I wish, not for the first time, that I hadn't read the godawful Youtube comments. /v Pennywise likes play with his food. There, 65% of the plot holes are covered. /v If I had a penny for every beep beep is from the book comment on here I'd be penny wise /v You would already have a Porg plush lol /v Yummy. /v Pennywise likes floating. /v You are gorgeous /v Stop trying to make Twisty Slides happen Pennywise! /v Marry me /v Ok /v shut up /v Hahah /v MeOw. /v ennywise the ancing cloon /v Great stuff as usual... :) /v Jenny is Pennywise, but occasionally she is Porg foolish. /v Jennywise! /v I like this. /v Sarcasm for most of the duration of this video... a big dislike from me. Just say it suck already if you hate it so much.. rather than beating around the bush like some b**ch! /v  That was... funny? I didn't laugh, but I'm pretty sure this was funny. /v Long time watcher, first time commenter. Your awesome. That is allz /v This feels nitpicky and lacks the acerbic wit of your other videos.  It's just griping.   Everybody gripes.  Be better. /v You're beautiful and a nerd.  <3 /v Oh my gosh, I'm so bad. /v I don't care if I get judged, Carol is a MILF  /v Me but with youtube /v Oh my godddd I wish I had your life /v That is my grandmother in a nutshell /v My name is carol and I don't know if I should get mad or not but this was pretty funny. /v I love Gus way more than one who enjoys his videos should. /v I wanted to laugh at this but it made me cry /v Obsessed with Pintrest? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoops I requested a video I must be persecuted /v You're the only person I watch I have notifications turned on for. /v Gus  is slowly evolving into HowToBasic... Lord help us all.. /v Carol is taking over /v Gus Johnson breaks a laptop: a short film /v GUS YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT I GOT AN AD /v How is this available in 1080p? It looks like it was filmed on a android potato\n\n\n\n\nGet your shit together Carol. /v Gus, that shit was very funny I want more of you.....please. /v I'm in love with the song at the end of all Gus's videos WHERE IS IT FROM I NEED TO KNOW /v Is this tech rax now /v this is like budget Brandon Rogers /v Your videos actually suck.\n\nI love them. /v I used to laugh at jokes like him puking up his popcorn, but now that I'm actually going through that I don't find it funny anymore. I understand it's a joke and I would never ask someone to not use that as a joke as long as it's in good fun. But it still gets to me. I really hope that the stigmas and shame surrounding eating disorders gets better within the next few years. /v It's funny because it's true /v 1:15 that actually took some skill as QB I would kinda know /v WOA its the same laptop from when you go to class and open your laptop but forget you were looking at adult things /v What is the song that plays at the end of the video? During the subscribe screen? /v Gus, what is happening to being subtle !? /v         /v I love these videos! I kind of want to see more of Carol. Love this series if that's what you will call it! /v Practically Neil Breen with how you treat that laptop. /v Well... I guess this passed as entertainment. /v Jesus fuck these videos keep getting better and better. /v So after carol's wine addiction caused her to loose her job and husband she turned to Netflix to fill the void in her heart /v please make carol a regular bit /v You should stick to comedy sketches. Documentaries are too dark for the younger audience. /v its 4:00 am\ni need sleep\nbut i need Carol MORE\n\nI'M SO BAAAD /v Am I back on Tinder /v You are seriously my favorite channel. /v That's some nice original content you got there, itta be a shame if anyone were to repost it and profit off it.  ~9Gag /v Comedic gold. Lol I love this character haha /v THE HIKE MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD THE SHIT CAME OUT THANK YOU /v Is this the same character as in the wine video /v Now I want a Brandon Rodgers and Gus Johnson collab /v this made me do a giggle /v this is gonna be the best series on youtube /v Oh I could go for a slice right now /v This is what I expect to see from an experienced Youtuber. /v These new bits are your BEST work.  You've got an excellent character going! /v This reminds me of those Fred videos. /v I really like his Ohio State mom tshirt  /v Gus: hmm, i have an old computer that doesn't work. Should i throw it away? Nah, i have a better idea! /v I go to OSU are you my mom? /v The music at the end really helps me to reflect on what the fuck I just watched. /v How many laptops have you destroyed for this channel? /v Oh Carol ur such a card. /v That song at the end always calms me /v PLEASE make more obsessed with videos. /v this character reminds me of gayle waters waters /v Someone has been watching Brandon Rogers! /v it made me so sad when he smashed the laptop /v make a vid about people who won't shut up about himym /v How this Video was made:Hm...i have a laptop that i can destroy and it's pink with Stickers. What to do? /v I'm guessing someones laptop broke before the video? /v I'm a watchin' woman. /v Legend says Carroll is still looking for the pass /v YAAASSS CAROL. ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE U, GIRL. /v This is the video I want aliens to find millions of years in the future /v I love this series. /v damn gus you looking THICC in them yoga pants /v Go long Carol!  Looks like Carol needs some more wine. /v I am still confused as to who Carol is /v MORE CAROL /v I want your pants. /v Neil Breen would be proud. /v Oh Carol, you're so crazyyy /v Too real /v Carol's obsessions are hilarious! /v You have a nice ass..Carol? #datbooty#noshame#gettinit /v omg moooooreee carol please /v EVERY.BASIC.WHITE.WOMAN.IN.COLLEGE. /v More Carroll /v Oh Carol. /v Okay. /v That was fuckin beautiful /v CAROL IS BACK. /v Carol is back! /v LOL 1:42, BAH /v same neighborhood as Khonjin? /v What about starbucks? /v Gus, i'm scared /v This. /v STARTIN TO SMELL LIKE ASSHOLE IN HERE /v Ohio State mom /v Who is she? /v soaps and streams /v It's Carole /v Yes. /v Lmao who else got a Netflix ad? /v More Carol videos please! /v *lEaVe mE AlOne* /v if your gonna make fun of people that may or may not have mental problems at least do a better job of dressing up and yeah ur gay /v Indira Varma is incredibly beautiful.  As much as the Dorne story was ass, I did enjoy Ellaria as a character. /v RIP Bad Pousey /v Hey can you let me out of the manacles now? Hey, where are you going? ...guys? /v best scene with a best actresses and with the best acting /v Lena is such a great actress. Everybody focus on their fav charactes but really few realize how much effort this woman puts on making Cersei so perfectly hateful /v So sad these incredible actresses were wasted on a mediocre script. Dave and Dan don't deserve them. /v the cersei acting was so good, the little moment when she ask: why did you do that? and then shes face change completely to a sentimental face and than she realize that shes losing control and position and recover herself with that revenge face again /v Now we know why lena's acting was phenomenal in this scene, because it was the first Scene to film for S07 and she was pissed. /v Let the most beautiful woman in the world talk for fuck sake /v Indira should be nominated, very good expressions  /v Boring scene! one of many scenes I would fast forward! The only story lines I prefered watching were: Ned(RIP) Tyrion, Arya, Bran, Jon, Daenerys & The Night king/Wights! /v How do you watch full episodes in the UK? /v OH NO! Dorne which was never conquered by the Targaryens and has one of the biggest army will now retaliate. Oh wait,  the tv show writers are too dumb to replicate a complex multilayered story.  The rest of the world doesn't exist anymore,  only a handful of characters and they're plot lines. /v Omg Lena  she is the best actress in game of thrones for me /v My friend just spoiled season 8 on me by telling me the important parts of the script... I'm just saying HBO if that is the ending your going for then you shouldn't even make a season 8 /v The Mountain over acted this scene. /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v GAME OF THRONES: TOP BEST AND WORST CHARACTERS on our channel /v Kinda reminds me of how Ned Stark's Brother and Father died. /v This is the only satisfying scene I can recall of the Dornish story line. /v A Goodbye Kiss is not that rep.\nHere is some kissing related https://goo.gl/dDF5ks /v anyone have the full episode of this and ep 2 (The Game revealed) /v As much as I hated the Dorne storyline in the show, I really loved this scene. With Cersei talking about Oberyn's death, it just reminded us why Ellaria did what she did...  To hurt Cersei.\n\nI actually felt bad for her and Tyene in this scene, which I didn't think was possible... /v But rosabell has the best tits I have ever seen /v You think you have enough videos to buffer for the next 2 years? /v good but I died... /v Make a new skript of seazon 8, pleace! I dont want this spoilers to be true! /v I wanted a good rape and skull crushing scene for the daughter. YOU RAPED HER YOU MURDERED HER YOU KILLED HER CHILDREN /v Shut up and give me season 8 /v Its always funny to watch actors try to convince that they work hard... cant wait for animated or CGI version that doesn't have to pay these scumbags. /v Thank goodness Indira Varma is a great actress. They butchered the Dorne story x.x /v Yea that canada goose jacket is keeping you warm in the dungeon :P /v I was pissed that Bronn didn't come to the rescue of Tyenne.\nYou don't let the bad pussy go stale! /v So wait....did they actually die? One side of me is saying that they are going to reappear next season some how lol /v Lena Headey makes Cersei one of the scariest villainesses, or should I say, lionesses in film history. /v Yeah, this scene was brilliant and all, but who the heck rules in Dorne now??? /v Is she alive? I am gonna miss her. /v Couldn't have happened to nicer people. /v Lena such a great actor! /v I was sad they died because bronn never got that bad pussy /v So it's all fluffing around the actors before shooting, but after the shoot you all boot off home and leave them stuck in their chains. Tisk tisk. /v Why is no one bringing us that there is still a huge army is Dorne that is not being used?? And surly someone was left in charge to run down while it's leaders were away, why can't the person(s) running dorne just send their army to join daenerys so long as she agrees to free to sand snakes + where the hell is the rest of the Tyrell army!?! /v Nice ,,, any one friendship me ???? /v Where tf are these episodes? Can't find them on HBO GO. /v  /v Rosabell is the hottest women  on the show /v I hope they show bad pussy tits one more time before she's killed off, those things were crafted by the many faced god himself /v what a sad day when the hottest girl in show is killed, haven felt this way since Rose. /v I hope yall realize how shit and unworthy of our money this season was. Like its been going down hill but to kill the sand snakes without giving them a proper story was fucked up. Cant wait to pirate season 8 /v check out THIS AMAZING ROCK cover of Got https://youtu.be/tbNdyQB8FkA /v I don't want to marry the Frey girl. /v It is so good to see Ellaria and Tyene alive and well. /v Does does official make cersei an even more ruthless ruler than the mad king? Can't imagine him doing something worse than this imo /v Cersei is way more interesting than Dany /v 0:29 I think they used a different take in the show, you could hear the desperation and almost a sense of innocence in Lena's voice in the final take. /v 0:00 looks like something you can get from the dark web /v She is bad ass villain /v I empathized with Cersei because all she did was for her children. I think she actually considered them more like extentions of herself. When they died, every excuse disappeared. She's pretty much sane. She had done stupid things, and now she's suddenly smart. It's because she didn't use her brains when she had children. Now she uses them. She's perfectly fine, and yet she's as cruel as before. I don't empathize with her anymore. Die, bitch! (Not triggered) /v I'm gonna miss Cersei when she's gone. She's so evil, ya just gotta love her. /v I don't care these , I only care Daenerys and season 8 /v What the fuck, where's the rest of the episode? 2 minutes ain't shit. /v I could watch that scene so many times, the acting in it is top notch /v One of my favorite scenes from season 7 /v Anybody's biggest wish to be a part of this incredible film crew or just me /v waiting for episode 4 video /v 1x 10 minutes is better than 10x 1 minute! /v It was honestly a breathtaking scene. So well done. Thank you to the actresses and crew /v i'm not gonna lie...i was shitting myself during this episode, Oberyns death freaked the fuck out of me and i was expecting more of the same in this scene. Easily one of the most intense pieces of TV i've seen in a while /v As much I absolutely loved to see Ellaria finally get her much deserved dose of Karma from Cersei & as much as I totally loved seeing Euron butcher the other 2 Sand Snakes during the Greyjoy naval battle, I was really sad to see Tyene set up to die the way she did in Cersei's dungeons as she was the only Sand Snake that I did like even though she fucking killed badass Areo Hotah by stabbing him in the back which was lame. I'm still going to miss Tyene, definitely not going to miss Ellaria & her other daughters!!!\n\nI really hope that Ellaria realizes that thanks to her actions she has effectively rendered the once mighty House Martell, the house of her very own great love, completely & utterly extinct!!!\n\nOberyn may've been cocky & arrogant & vengeful but he was also very firmly against the idea of punishing children for the sins of their parents & he never would've allowed Ellaria to murder poor Myrcella!!! /v I masturbated to this scene, like 5 times in a row. /v I wanna buy some cool merch. Who else misses rep the realm collection??? /v 2019 for season 8 wtf guys cant wait so much time please kill me now and call lady melisandre and resurrect me when season 8 is out /v This was a throwback, to what the Mad King did to Rickard Stark, and Brandon Stark. /v https://youtu.be/pNYPuXUl_m0 /v Goodbye to the best tits in the entire series /v Lucifer Teaser Season 3 https://youtu.be/v5EzpvxhmuQ /v thats my cercei. /v Season 7 sucked already /v Te amo GOT ! /v Lena Headey, man. /v I love Lena.

Those Teeth itselfh deserve an award. hahahahahah /v so many plotholes /v Majestic. <3  :D /v Nice video! /v Cersei is the queen and wants to be the queen. Sooner or later Cersei always gets what she wants \nREPLY /v Indira is so hot /v Tyene is so hot /v Qu bueno que lo tradujeran o subtitularan. /v I much prefer Indira's regular voice to Ellaria's... /v Worst season yet, the writing keeps getting worse. /v He's so lucid an woke, and that's great. The only thing to worry about is that he's talking from the point of view of someone who is lost. He thinks he's doomed. Maybe he did something really bad in the past. /v People think this man is crazy because he's telling you guys there's no meaning to bullshiticons fairytale stories we are collateral damageand the quest for world domination /v Love how that woman just habitually shoots down any opinions that aren't hers /v I'm on board with JC. He's not crazy, go fuck yourself. /v I'll have to try the tetrahedron defence if I ever wind up in court. /v Jim is actually acting ridiculous here to express his point!\nThat's why he fades in Hollywood, he is pursuing something more spiritual.\nWe can sense that since he got the beard /v Jim is a weird in his own way which is awesome but we do matter and it is our earth given to us /v This is called Depression /v Only few people made change but most of then made money. /v He's right though we don't matter or things would be different.\nWay 2 stick it 2 THEMAN /v If you call out the bullshit, Youre crazy. \n\nNothing matters. Only love /v To be honest I don't blame him, he's been through so much the last  few years. He is just seeing things on a different conscious level /v Jim knows things most don't. /v You know you are deep into the shithole when you need an overrated, exagerated celebrity to tell you what the rest of us have known forever. Also, next to an E reporter, even this asshole looks deep and mystic. /v He's on another level. He's fucking awesome. /v I agree to with the point we don't matter /v The fact that he's right.... frightens me. /v It's not entirely stupid actually .. that We are a field of energy dancing for itself might be a very accurate description of reality. A lil meta tho ... /v Jim carrey is the man,  icon is sucks /v Truth bombs, love it .We're all just farts in the wind /v FINALLY. ... Someone puts Fashion where it deserves to be. ... MEANINGLESS is an understatement. ... Fashion is a Giant Wheel of Pretentious Horseshit spun by worthless pretentious ASSHOLES. /v knowing that nothing matters is a way for depressed people feel purposeful /v This man's message woke me up. /v EVERYONE: Jim is has been taking a shit ton of mushrooms to prepare for his role as Terrance McKenna and it seems he's actually waking up to a lot of his philosophy. /v This reporter is annoying as fuck /v Jim just find the true. /v too much Twin Peaks. I can dig it /v I want the same drugs that Jims got. /v lol now that was a crack up and he was on point lol. /v Jims a legend when the media attack people this is what happens and he's saying the truth /v He has totally lost it. /v Do your research on the effects of television and who controls the television stations. 6 years ago I through my TV in the trash and haven't looked back. If you're still watching TV, you're being systematically dumbed-down. /v that reporter is so superficial and dumb /v What he said is so vague that people in the comments are just filling in the blanks with their own projections of conspiratorial mindsets. I think the real people being trolled are right here in the comments. /v Damnnnn Jim's on the non duality tip /v Kekistani Ministry of Culture supports this man. /v His my hero rn , its nice to know im not alone /v What does he truly believe, i need a little insight here thanks!\nI still think it's nihilism, but i'm not 100 percent sure /v I didnt see anything weird xD hes is just  being himself xD and he is not who everybody thinks he is. XD love you jim for president of usa <3 .. Dont blame on the reporter  shes just iq lower than most of the people down here but she is hot xD /v From russia with love. /v jim is the best.  True heel /v He's seen the matrix /v looks like he dropped acid /v Man he's getting old innit /v 'And... I don't care.' /v He would get along with Dan Howell /v Is this his audition for true detective 3? /v Jim has had an awakening people. This is obviously Jim just seeing how everything is an illusion, and it seems like he's just experimenting; playing around :). When you raise your consciousness state, you don't take things too seriously /v She was born fo this interview /v Jim has been my favorite for so long. I appreciate his blunt honesty and eccentricity. At the end of the day, he has been through a lot but has also done a lot for the entertainment industry. If he doesn't consider himself an icon, he is to be commended for it because that is being extremely humble. But it also solidifies the fact that it truly goes without saying. Jim's a gem. /v You all idolize him for this yet none of you can tell me what the fuck he just said. He literally just said like whoa man, were a bunch of atoms\n\nROFL wow /v I love this guy. Even when he's not trying to be funny, he's still hilarious! Lol  we don't matter lmao time and place for that Jim haha but only he can say it in that kind of kind of way. /v Seems like she got angry , cuz that's what stupid people usually do when someone tells the truth .Hollywood , fashion industry is all bullshit made to brainwash us  . Jim Carrey is one of the few people out there who is speaking the truth /v Jim been hitting the DMT again /v I think jimmys a little bit bored these days /v He's correct, We don't matter. We're just a ball floating around an endless nothingness that will all eventually burn out. So Fuck It! /v He's speaking his mind, telling the truth and also completely messing with her! love him. He's done with the whole hollywood celebrity thing and good for him  /v That lady's hair is crazy  it looks so bad /v He's speaking the truth :o /v The world could end tomorrow and not a single thing in the entire universe would weep a tear.\n\nGet over yourselves, Hollywood. You are the epitome of creating fake fantasy worlds that you like to shape up as if it was all real. /v I mean it's true. No matter what you do in life we're all headed to the same place. /v I believe in icons. Come down to my church and see some. /v I couldn't agree more Jim it's not our world and humans need to stop fkn putting themselves above everything else and wake the fk up. /v Watch her look at the camera like oh this guy's crazy help!!  No he's right 5000 dollars for a shirt is fuckin retarded and so is everyone celebrating the icon that sells it fuckin die all of you. Jim Carey is a boss. /v Jim reached that stage where he's like fuck it, say what you want, see what happens #imwithJim /v man.. i love this guy. /v Jim totally brain fucked that dumb chick. She had no clue what he was talking about :P /v The media calls him crazy he just woke /v To those saying he lost his mind. Id rather lose my mind and be free internally than belive my mind so whole heartedly that it controls and limits my perspective of what reality actually is... Which imo is pure potential. /v Didn't expect an existential discussion on the nonexistence of the self and the illusion of the ego at Fashion Week, did she? /v E! You have the nerve to say he sounded off?? Jim Carrey has always thought like that,people just didn't pay attention,they got distracted with his Talent to make people Laugh. /v ''I don't care, we don't matter and that's a good news'' Jim :D /v Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind\nPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time\nAll day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy\nThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify\nCan you help me, occupy my brain?\n\nOh yeah\nI need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find\nI can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind\n\nMake a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry\nHappiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal\nAnd so as you hear these words telling you now of my state\nI tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late  /v First s*** Jim Carrey has said that I actually agree with /v that girl should be fired. her constant staring at the camera with her look of superiority and judgement is so distracting and meaningless to anyone but herself. WE DON'T CARE YOU DON'T APPROVE OF HIM AND HIS WORDS. /v    ) /v WoW  /v Love it. Fk celeb culture. /v Illuminati detected. /v does she shave her forehead? /v shes so stupid ! /v Cocain is amazing /v He's perfect! /v Suicide alert !!!! /v jim buddy.. whats goin on? /v Someone has been reading Descartes. /v Smart man /v He reminds me of Idunno guy /v Idiota /v Hes the man /v Nice /v Jim Carrey after Burning man /v Trolllll /v ROASTED!!! /v What a dick. /v HAIL HYDRA! /v Brilliant. /v Jim Carrey watched too much Black Mirror /v Why is it so popular to call people brainwashed because they like fashion or anything else the television industry helped bringing to it's position in the world?  \nDo you all prefer that people were like Jim Carrey? Living in a world that makes sense in his mind, and acting like people are dumb idiots for not feeling the same as him? /v This man is woke af /v How does Mugumogu not collapse in a heap of laughter?!! Maru's liquified form is hilarious! /v Wtf /v Another Maru masterpiece  /v Very funny! /v Cube Maru Swish Tail /v So funny /v  /v maru not bad 2:43 2:53 /v Mary becomes an ant farm /v HAHAHAHAHA  I loved the flip!  <3 /v  /v   ! /v Maru is hilarious! /v Phish ish fofally kumphy... /v MARU the great contortionist!! /v Maru is a super-fluid /v  /v  /v awwww so cuteee /v () /v Awww gorgeous boy  /v wahahaha  /v  /v  /v maru is my everything /v Seni seviyoruuuummmm maruuuuu /v  /v liquid cat /v Maru the cute pichi /v maru est liquide! /v Love      Xxxxxx /v   \n /v () /v  /v Fetishist! /v Maru the artist!!!!! /v Maru Got Talent! /v ()\n(*^^*) /v 1:01() /v  /v (^^;)() /v (`) /v \n\n /v \n /v \n /v Last shot = cat ^ 3! /v  /v Maru is very flexible cat. Just miracle! /v *I f  I  F i t s  I  S i t s .* /v maruhanahana() /v He is so cut <3 <3 <3 :3 /v 1:45: Maru: Gee, Hana looks kinda comfy over there. Maybe I should exit this box and just sleep on the floor? Naaa /v I think something is wrong with your cat XDDDDDDDDDDDD /v I wish I was as calm as Maru when I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. /v Still better than most performance art.  /v 1 Maru should be a new unit of volume /v Hello where can I find someone who breeds Maru's? I would like ten of those please. /v LOL, I knew it! Be water, my friend... /v Not it's not uncomfortable! It's just the way I like it! /v Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, we have made this box transparent so we can see the wild Maru in his native environment.... /v Maru looks at Hana wondering why she doesn't want to get in the box. /v Better translation of more fitting feeling would be more comfortable position ;) /v Hana finds the Maru Channel (on Aquarium TV) is boring and she goes to sleep, so that is when something very interesting happens! /v Maru you are one strange cat but I love you for it. <3 /v so exciting and really funny; never seen before this :-). Maru is really a special cat; applause :-) /v Brilliant camera work. You effortlessly and naturally capture Maru's dry wit, and serious commitment to the task at hand. Brava. /v I expected the T-1000 theme to start when Maru was melting. /v This cat is just incredible  /v He is like the Terminator Kitty, he melts into liquid form, then back to Cat form. /v 6 people just here to hit dislike a video of a cat fitting in and finding super comfortable in a fish tank that can make him fall asleep. What's wrong with you people? /v I wonder... what happened to the fish before?? If that's the aquarium, then something happened to the fish?  /v Maru is poetry in motion...slow motion. <3 <3 /v Love these videos always put a smile on my face /v Maru takes himself for a fish /v I love these cats!!! /v It's like he's in a glass case of emotion. /v My God! How is this possible? How can this container fit all of Maru's fluffiness??? True zen master he is! /v It's like when you really want to fit into those jeans .... /v Maru lends credence to the theory that cat are a liquid. /v I'll have a big glass of Maru! /v Love how Maru jumps in so Hana can't claim it.\n0:38 doesn't look very comfy ... \n1:52 doesn't look very comfy either ... \n2:39 well, and so does this ...\nI know that feeling (mainly from trying to put in furniture in rooms) when it almost fits ... but there is one half centimeter missing. /v Maru: all my dreams come true! Hana: I'll need you ! Love them both!! /v God I love cats. They're so weird. /v So know they design Maru boxes, cool. /v Oh Maru, you've done it again! What a silly kitty! /v That's a lovely catfish you got there. /v  /v This is a Maru insta-classic! \n\nTop-tier box acrobatics. /v Maru is putting herself in the goldfish's shoes.. Adorable! /v if this is not proof that cats are in reality liquid, idk what is XD /v Omg!!! Maru your so adorable! I wish i could hug you!!! /v Maru is priceless. Thank you so much for sharing him with us. I want to be a box that he will jump into and sleep peacefully inand, now that I type it, I see that's a really weird thing to say. But I love him. He's great. Thank you again. /v He needs another box to put his tail into /v Maru doesn't care if we think it fits, he just wants to get inside no matter what! /v Maru: Human... it's not tight enough. \nI think it's snug enough.\nMaru:  (2:22) Whaddya mean snug enough? There's so much room I can do gymnastics in this thing! Look. Forward Roll. Look. Headstand. Look. Oh. Bother. Maybe if I just rub against the plastic enough I can puff up and fill the space. \n\nHonestly, humans are getting lazier, I have to do the job myself. \n\nSaid Maru. /v Maru, Trick or Treating as a catfish in an aquarium isn't going to work out. /v That has to be the most awkward resting position i've ever seen in any animal. /v Maru, a slave to his nox doination duty. 3:30 describes my week /v That is so funny!!

He's been out there since the hurricane started /v Looks like he wanted to ask the storm some questions. /v He's like \nTHE KRUSTY KRABBBBB KRABBBBB\nPIZZA IS THE PIZZZZAAAAAAA /v I like the part when he gets blown away. /v the krusty krab pizza is the pizza for you and me /v The power of Christ repels you! /v He's the prince that was promised to defeat the Night King!

And coming to Iphone X....This part is a big joke.Even china phones doesn't have that Awkward display design. Whats the ugly stepping in the upper part of the screen?? Who the hell approved the design..Total disappointment. Look at S8 infinite display it brought nice look to the phone. I will stick with My Iphone 7 which is the best design ever... /v smh, still has giant ass bezels. OnePlus 5 still far superior /v iPhone 8 Looks Cool but Android is still better because many of Apple iPhone 8 2017 features is copied from Android!\nBut I have to say they implemented a lot of cool stuff! /v Why isn't there a rose goldfor the iPhone 8 /v Will iPhone 7/7 Plus cases be able to fit on this device? /v That's a iPhone 7 not x /v Sorry -- better your phone\nrather than mine -- Thanks /v For the iPhone's 10th anniversary will you destroy 10 iPhone X's /v Do a durability test on the iPhone X and iPhone 8. /v What I wouldn't give to be that phone /v Zach, the iPhone X is out.

Ceramic screens. /v What a shame for Gorilla glass 5. /v Oh dear essential - the iPhone 4 and note 2 faired better in similar drop tests. Doesn't look good for sales. /v You are due more credit than you are given my friend. /v You did well. ! /v These spam bots are on steroids /v make a giftaway for that crack essential plss.. hahaha /v Mi mix /v Do lg v30 bend test pls /v Can you teardown nokia 8? On next video /v agent 47 is now droppin' phones for a livin' /v Waiting for Nokia 8 test and bend test /v After all the reviews on the iPhone 8 from other YouTubers, Jerry will do the ultimate challenge, the durability test. /v Please don't do drop tests, Youtube already full of those idiots with their stupid drop tests, like you said it's so random, unpredictable and proves nothing.\nI like how you do it for exceptional phones, felt curious and as well thought the ceramic would shatter first, but wow, ceramic isn't bad for phones after all.\nGreat job. Please keep it up like that Zack:) /v Did you... make a tripod out of anal beads? /v Can you do a test on Samsung galaxy j5 2017? /v Sooo... when are you gonna do a giveaway with that Tissot on your wrist? :D /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v You amaze me every single time. This time it was background music! /v Could you test the keyrocera dura force pro? /v Is it worth to buy a screen protector for an already broken device? (iPad Pro 10.5) /v ok ,, i need .. screen cover .. rather than back cover :D /v Great choice of music. So I guess Ceramic and Titanium are the way to go for premium phones? /v Jerry reminds me of johnny sins...pros  will understand!!!!! /v Have you done a durability test on a elephone 8? /v you should you Xperia XZ1  to record slo mo. /v How does he cover the barcode... /v Today weve learned that ceramic is stronger than gorilla glass. Who wouldve guessed. /v Dude! You should at least iron your shirt or throw it in the dryer before coming onto YouTube with a trashy look. Stay classy man /v Do a teardown of the apple watch series 3, I would love to see how they fit everything in there /v Pls test the new liquad glass they have out for smart phones /v Ceramic should be on the screen !! /v Who else believes phone companies purposefully cripple the strength of their screens so people have to buy new phones when the screens inevitably break? Heck, I've seen glass from corning that seems to be tons stronger then what they put on phones. Is this just me? /v make the phone clear whos with me h /v Super impressed with the titanium/ceramic combo durability here. Too bad about the screen though. /v Zack, how about growing ur hair first? /v My S8 back cracked on 1st drop from my lap. :'( I worked hard to get that phone but now I have to live with it for atleast 2 more years. /v I hope Samsung will use ceramic too for their new phones /v Hey jerry can you answer this question perhaps? so i have the samsung galaxy s8 and ever since ive activated bixpy things have happened such as bixpy waking up my phone screen for no reason even without me calling upon her, bixpy opening its homepage even while the phones locked. I set the bixpy app to factory reset which would be its state before i activated it, and now every so often within a longer interval of seconds the phone will wake itself up as if im pressing the power button. This even happens when i shut it down and its charging, i dont press the button yet the screen will wake up to show the percentage when its off or go to the screen before you unlock the phone while its on. What do you think the problem is? i dont know if its taxing on the battery when its on and it wakes the screen up but its rather annoying /v who wants hollywood to cast zack as the new hitman \ngimme a like and zack give me a heart plz /v Get a real job lol /v Why are you so SMART I'm jealous /v This video is the reason you are the only channel I still watch that tries to break phones. While others think that destroying phones looks cool, you actually care about accuracy. So just keep doing what your doing and Ill be here watching your videos. /v How about we get rid of gorilla glass  and replace it entirely with ceramic on flagships /v Could you do the Xiaomi Mi5s? /v I would love to see a scientific drop test, like simulating the drop on a specific side with a specific power. Tools can help you do that, i know you would want to try :) /v One of the best explained drop tests out there /v I dropped my S8 just like the first test in your video but on a wooden floor and ended up with a broken screen. Not only that, I was disappointed when I noticed scratches on the screen just after a couple of weeks of buying the phone and I realised later that they're caused by plastic rounded object in my pocket where I used to carry my phone. I had an S4 before I buy the S8 and I've used it for more than 3 years and till now it has no noticable scraches on the screen even that I used it the same way as I use the S8. /v this is why they should do metal only phones /v Coming soon:\n\n*Q* *U* *I* *N* *T* *E* *S* *S* *E* *N* *T* *I* *A* *L* Phone /v Tbh I'm kinda puzzled at the results of those new phones, I've just lost my 5 year old Galaxy Nexus because of circuitry problem (it simply doesn't boot up anymore) but with all the hits it took in those years it never shattered, it just got a small bumb in a corner of the glass that didn't even reach the screen. /v Gorilla Glass is just Marketing...they break easy /v i like drop test, can you do Xperia XZ Premium drop test? /v You should use Xperia xz premium for slow-mo..best of best /v Sir please give me mobile /v kids in africa could have eaten that phone /v no enough brightness on the screen. so i can't understand wether the display and the touchpad is working or not. /v IMPRESSIVE back panel I must say, but how about a drop ON ceramic? Like the bathroom floor =) would love to see a Drop test of the Nokia 8, after the bend and teardown of course =) /v Can you make video on phone from CAT S41 and S31. Mean to be very durable I would like know how much durable and what are these /v 1:10 My galaxy s8 situated scientifically on top of this tripod  /v Tear down a good Essential phone without damage it. /v A tempered glass screen protector and this phone won't need a case ever. Nice /v What's with the tribute music every time you drop it . . ? The violins and strings ensemble  this phone sucks tho. Compared to other market leaders /v Thank you for breaking glass where my kids play. /v Wish you had a xz premium. 960 fps slow motion \nPls use that for slow motion. It will be fun /v 4:58 What a wonderful dismount, full somersault with a double turn twist, marvelous!!\nCan anyone beat the Essential phone for the gold medal? I don't think so!! /v Sold on Ebay as slightly used /v This phone is essential enough to survive a drop! /v On cement - pissed off civil engineers incoming /v Gravity lmao /v Waiting for Honor 8 Pro Durability test /v Could you please test lenovo zuk z2 plus /v Those background sounds though...  /v iphone x /v sir..can you plz do #mi a1 durability test I'm waiting frm long tym plz /v Great work agent 47 /v zack   zack   bend iphone /v THE MUSIC XD /v do durability test of sony Xperia XA1 /v Nice /v Duablility test the new iPhone x /v Drop test Mi Mix 2 /v JerryHypnotizeEveryone /v my eyes /v Loved ur watch. Is it Tissot? /v 2:49 Reminds me Unravel music :v /v hitman is that you? /v you're really hot... /v Obi SF1 Teardown please /v Epic channel guarantee sub /v Jerry please test Meizu Pro 7 Plus!! /v As a cautious cell phone user, I think gorilla glass its pure junk. I have, accidently, ruined 6 phones in 13 months (thank you One Plus 3). one waste high drops.  Pulling out of the pocket and landing on a raised floor with ring screen protector shouldn't cause this much problems. Ceramic, clear front screens and plastic (damn easy scratching) are the only acceptable future thus far. 1000 dollars ruined because it gets caught on your pocket (or anything) shouldn't require a new screen. (which I also repair myself) /v My God...I didn't think it would get that bad. Praying for everyone affected.  /v I would hope they all become global warming enthusiasts who advocate scientific prevention of natural disasters. however I doubt it.. /v This is really horrifying, a sub from me. I hope to see more informative videos from you. Thanks for posting. /v Cheap trailers made of aluminum and ply wood held parked on bricks. Wtf do these people think will happen when they live in a hurricane state? I'm sorry but they are completely under built. The city should of changed massive codes in the 80s and stopped people from putting these shacks ups. \n\nI hope they realize a house in Florida should mean concrete walls and slab roof all reinforced with rebar and massive shutters on all windows and doors. \nJust like a cabin in Alaska is set up for major winters a house in a hurricane state should be set up for just that. A hurricane. /v Homes for sale.....fixer upper of course......insurance coverage may be high... /v If I was in a mobile home, or tiny house I wouldn't pick Florida as a place to live. /v Fake news smh....naples we pray for you /v It's so insane tat people are trying to minimize this. People lost their lives and lost their homes. People are dead. People are homeless. This is huge. Stop becoming desensitized to tragedy. Contribute to the aid, contribute whatever you can to help Floridians and also the non-Americans who are in much worse situations than this. They need our help stop minimizing this. /v I hope you all aren't serious where's the damage it was so hyped try those being your homes. Your neighborhood. Let's see a storm hit your house and destroy it. Just a regular thunderstorm that didn't have any hype. Lightning hits a tree and boom house is destroyed. You can enjoy fixing your house if you didn't die and not have to worry about that pesky hype /v FAKE NEWS ALERT! I live down here and the damage is minimal this was a cat 2 storm cat 1 up here in Sarasota, these pictures are of a mobile home park that was built below flood surge level... this is common in Florida. Most of these parks are grandfathered in for zoning so you live there at your own risk but no one can get flood or wind insurance. Most of the residential areas that are built to Zone 13' are fine in any storm, that includes everything built in the last 20 or so years. Florida is beautiful and clean today because mother nature knows best... and please  play some Jimmy Buffett when showing these /v I'm confused on why they are only showing mobile home parks....this is Naples, full of million dollar homes. SMH.I used to live there, my mother was there during the storm, show some real Naples.. /v Are those supposed to be houses or chicken coops? /v They should design different types of housing for areas where floods can happen. I'm sure scientists and engineers can think of something better than what private construction companies are doing.\nJust like in a heavy tornado region it would likely make sense to live in domes rather than cubes.\nIt's either this or just stop living in hazardous regions. /v And all I'm seeing in twitter was people making fun of irma like nothing happen wtf /v this is ur paradise america /v at least all the Nike Air Jordans made it out safe... /v They can now switch their name from Naples to Venice /v I'm going on vacation to Naples in November oof /v Why are they only showing small unstable homes? Just another case of the media taking things out of proportion /v This film shows manufactured housing communities, which are few and far between in Naples, Florida. /v No double wide trailer is safe! /v Amazing video\nHere is some related post https://goo.gl/tdW1R8 /v It's just water. /v Reminds me of the first settlement in Fallout 4 /v Fellas, was it gay to move away from Irmas path? I mean you are basically running away from a woman.  /v Woterfront properties are expensive. They will come and rebuild in hurry as flood insurances are covered. /v Mother earth cleaning up the tailor parks. /v W h why would anyone dislike this???? /v Trump did say he's going to create more jobs BUT.. he did not say how.\nWhat a waste...\nHouses near the coast need to be built out of CONCRETE and bullet PROOF GLASS(withstand debris), not wood nor (thin)glass. /v This place was so beautiful. I've made a drone video of it and its one of my favorite videos.

May be most houses are good. /v I live in miami. And thank god it wasnt that bad, yes a lot of destruction but it was going to be worse /v Looks like Naples turned into venice /v Ya gotta love them drones. I don't care what anyone says, I want one! /v Looks like property value is going to go down. This place sucks when it comes to real estate investment. Who would ever live in this forsaken place. The fed should just move these people to another area or state. Not worth living in these parts anymore. /v The best thing about Hurricane Irma is that it destroyed Milo Yiannopoulos' house.....unless George Zimmerman got crushed by a tree and I haven't heard about it yet..... /v those homes were a mess to begin with. no offense to any of you trailer trash /v not surprising. wind in a trailer park = this. yawn /v Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23 /v Hope you had flood insurance. /v Mobile homes aren't a good idea in FL. /v not as bad as harvey /v My grandma lives in Naples. She wasn't able to fly to NY where most of our family lives so she had to shack up inside an arena with hundreds if not thousands of other people /v That's where my cousin and aunt lives :/ this is really sad /v and this my friends is what they do to the less fortunate. i bet they will build luxury condos there /v Florida looks like a giant trailer trash community. /v This is actually quite the improvement lol /v The houses are basically like trailers, aluminum roofs etc, this level a damage is to be expected. The storm was way over hyped in regards to Florida. /v I evacuated and will be coming back home in a few days I'am so scared to see this in person and see what has happened to my home /v God Made America Great Again /v To think most of these people moved to Naples from up north to escape the snowy winters... /v All I see is cardboard houses... /v Reminds me of how the cataclysm affected Azeroth. Even though that's just a video game and this is real, it's scary to see that this much damage can happen! /v Ahahahahaha what a beautiful thing thanks Mother Nature for doing this now tell North Korea to hurry up and nuke them already /v Why only poor people are affected and not trump supporters.. /v Yeah, my naples are wet too... What? /v I guess you can say, it's not Naples anymore but Venice....\n                                   ...am I right ...am I right.? Hello? Anyone? /v better off staying in your car then a trailer /v And thats how we found out that we were atlantis the whole time\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we dont want to be fish people thats is why they are trying to fix this /v I knew Trump would bring more jobs to the US... Still proud of my vote! /v Such a beautiful vacation spot!\nLook at all those neighborhood pools! /v At least they have waterfront property now  /v I live in Naples and I was blessed to only have our pool cage get ruined. The inside of our house is fine we just have no power or running water yet; tons of trees have been uprooted and are laying in the streets also. /v Fake News.

I guess they think as people pray..the water evaporates right away and everything goes back to normal... well, not! prayers don't help.. didn't help before it started..they don't help now. Instead of praying if you want..donate either money.. blood..or whatever, but at least do something useful and don't turn your head right the other way after you prayed as if you had done the deed of the day. /v I'm very saddend to see this but can someone explain to me why americans build thier home with wood structures? Isnt that the worst  matriel to have in a storm/earthquake/flood situation? In my country 95% off the buildings are metal and concrete built. /v Hi everyone, please click here to support my GoFundMe campaign, Daughter needs to meet sick grandma: https://www.gofundme.com/daughter-needs-to-meet-sick-grandma?pc=sms_co_cardshare_a&rcid=1e3d444e7f224257bf92bef3bcef0d9c /v As soon as that eclipse happened, bad omen. /v Yeah that's bad and all but I feel like they over hyped this hurricane. Kind of like hurricane Matthew. /v No showers for 2 days. No power. No electricity. No water. \nI feel so sticky. /v deserved it /v Our hearts goes out to the people in Florida currently facing the wrath of this unforgiving storm, May you all stay safe and protected. /v It's distracting that you are making your hurricanes rotate in the wrong direction. /v did you got a wrong direction of rotation of those hurricanes?? /v What if there was a hurricane that was the size of the Atlantic Ocean /v The biggets hurricane that We know of is the red spot on Jupiter /v What is the song /v You do realize that it's Jupiter that has the hurricane, right? That's what the big red spot is. /v What about the Red Spot on Jupiter? /v PLEASE WATCH AND SHARE :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeOqRSqv9jk /v My friend be like\nFriend:dude what if you give names to the hurricanes.\nMe:umm maybe i can not do that i mean how crazy it is.\nFriend:give me an example.\nMe:ummm Hurricane Karen?\nFriend:mine is Hurricane Christy\nMe:wow! You are a great name caller.\nFriend:yeah! You too i mean we have the best names!\nMe:yeah! I agree. /v Think you meant Jupiter's red spot super cyclone and not Saturn. /v your all hurricanes are spinning in just OPPOSITE DIRECTION!! /v Isn't the Great Red Spot the biggest Storm in the solarsystem? /v you should have placed the Strongest storm to ever hit land /v Praying for those who are affected by hurricanes. Praying brings in a lot of positivism in life. Science supports the power of positive affirmations. When you release positive thoughts to the universe, the universe will return back it to you as things, later in the life. Concept well explained in the book Creative Visualization written by Shakthi Gawain. Here are some positive affirmations. https://youtu.be/ujOyoxLyqSg. /v When Saturn's storm was appearing, I thought that it was a joke hurricane  /v Your animation is wrong. they spin in the wrong direction... /v Did the music have to be this freaky? /v Why have I watched this a million times /v Where the fuck is Haiyan, and the Great Red Spot of Jupiter? /v Kinda of a bad comparison.. hurricane whoever fuck jus twent right up Florida's ass. U aint see it destroyed /v Why is a typhoon included in a hurricane video? Weird. /v Who the fuck named the smallest hurricane Marco? Well fuck you retard. /v You should do Tornado Size Comparisons or Volcano Size Comparison /v Tropical cyclone rotates counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere /v Where is Yolanda from Philippines /v And Also,Saturns Hexagonal Storm Is An Anti-Hurricane which it spins Uhhhhh..... Counter Clockwise? Clockwise? Pls Like My Comments and reply to me if I'm wrong /v The hurricanes are spinning the wrong direction. But a very nice comparison. /v I'm surprised that Super Typhoon Haiyan wasn't mentioned. It was big, VERY powerful at landfall, and caused A LOT of death and destruction! It was one of the perfect storms! /v man what if Saturn's storm hit us this world would be toast lol /v No the biggest storms are in Jupiter no Saturn! /v If Hurricanes are getting bigger and stronger then why is the strongest and largest back in 1979? /v And so why are they all going crazy saying Irma is the largest ever recorded, fail. /v Typhoon Tip must be made up it was like 50 years ago and global warming wasn't as bad /v Where is Great Red Spot? /v I'd say Saturn's Storm is a category 500. /v Except they rotate counter clockwise is the northern hemisphere. /v Hurricane PATRICIA      ( I'm sorry) /v the history better ships at the history size /v 1:03 woah...\nhurricane irma:\nC: 5\nD (in mi and km) 645km / 400mi (whoa) /v Marco might as well have been a damn supercell with that size /v I can't stop watching this. /v Why Sandy is just category 3? /v Poor America, looks like it's turning into the Philippines now. /v The last one creeped me out cause I thought it was an actually hurricane about to happen on earth... Man that would whip us all out /v Damn, and I thought Irma was huge! /v The first weather satellite was launched in 1960, so we have only on-the-ground reports of anything before that. /v I was so expecting a yo momma joke on the end XD /v Lol gotta include the real hurricanes of other planets, I didn't even think about that /v I imagine a Saturn's Storms here in Earth /v Typhoon Tip is such a badass name for the largest hurricane ever. /v I was hit by hurricane sandy I was in Long Island at the time /v Saturn is like Bitch, please /v good thing i dont live in saturn lol /v You realize you've got them rotating the wrong way, don't you?  Credibility zero. /v Why not call hurricane super ultra mega destroyer of worlds 3001 so people would be evacuating? instead of some stupid name /v L O L IM SORRY I KNOW THIS ISNT A FUNNY SITUATION OR VIDEO BUT WHEN SATURNS HURRICANE APPEARED I WAS LIKE WTF KINDA HURRICANE IS COMING NEXT AND I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS ON SATURN /v You do realize the one on Jupiter is three times the size of Earth /v Why are hurricanes named after people's names.... /v Glad the largest are in the past. /v Why are all of the pictures of the same hurricane though? /v Who else read Hurricane Death instead of Hurricane Dean?  /v Nice you made it to trending /v Interesting perspective...however, your hurricanes in your video spin the wrong way for the lower level winds.  Although,  there is a clockwise spin during a hurricane, the damaging winds and storm surge come from the anti-clockwise spin of the low pressure at the surface, and the clockwise spin comes from the upper level winds.\n\nUnless of course, you live south of the equator, then you're spot on.  :)\n\nJust a thought...  :) /v Shit I didn't realize Sandy was so big, I was on LI when it hit. /v where do i get the beyblades? /v How about Typhoon Yolanda, is it that small? /v Really amazing, I like it very much. \nI also like more amazing, https://goo.gl/9GPdRT /v You think Irma was bad? GO TO SATURN /v 2 misleading informations :\n1. In north hemisphere, hurricane are rotating counterclockwise\n2. Tropical storm never get eye in their center, else it would be a hurricane.\n\nIt's not really the size of a hurricane than the wind force around the eye which makes a hurricane dangerous.\n\nBut the video is interesting. /v I live in New York in rockland and hurricane sandy hit me and my family it was so bad that my basement flooded sad but I didn't know that's how big hurricane sandy was! /v did you forgot all the hurricane names like camille /v I was born when hurricane katrina hit /v Hurricane Matthew didn't have the skull, tho /v Hurricane saturn: hold my Beer bitches -_- /v My names Olivia...... /v wheres hurricane ike? /v Ill forget about Irma xD /v Check out Cyclone Yasi /v WOW! /v Saturn storm category 110 /v typhoon tip: I'm huge asf boooiii\nSaturn's storm: sike /v Do eruption comparison /v hurricane Otto /v Wow a real eye opener /v wrong rotation direction /v You forgot Harvey /v Rita? /v Cyclone Yasi? /v Another video also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbMjq3ue-iA /v Do car size comparison /v Jupiters storm is greater than saturns! /v Hurricane Irma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyIyny5Etss /v Huracn Mitch??? /v Sub for sub anyone? /v Hurricanes are basically gods fidget spinners /v SIZE DOES NOT MATTER!!!!   ;^) /v Hurricane Katrina, more like hurricane torrtilla /v Hey guys! lets move to Saturn! /v JUPITER NOT SATURN /v He is trying to be anything but gay  /v Pansexual is just a fancy way of saying you're bi, lol what is with these tumblr made up sexuals /v He's a living breathing human zombie!!! he is attracted to your BRAIN!!! /v You are not Native American LMAO . You're black be proud of that. That's like when white people say they're Native American when they look straight from Britain lmao /v Omg this was so misleading. I was %100 sure they were going to make a match, I mean look at them sing in the beginning. /v love them. their harmonies sound great /v his voice is beautiful /v they are so cute /v No love connection but still loved this episode!!! /v They have been my favorite duo so far. Loved them both. /v They both look so good i can't /v THEY CUTEEEEEE i love this friendship /v Awe that didn't turn the way I thought it would /v I thougt they would be together /v when he said Pansexual is a term that specifically denoted the fact that you're attracted to... i automatically filled in the next word with PANS PANS PANS i am terrible /v what is the name of the song that they sing together? /v Wth I was thinking that oml they could be a power couple, they really get each other and they're all about the soul etc etc...\nThen they both said nah.. like whaaaat. But I also get why /v The best romantic relationships begin with strong friendship. If you don't know that - you'll close a lot of the wrong doors.\n\nAlso, he needs help choosing a suit. /v my man dressed up like the president for a blind date /v im kind of in love with both of them,,,,, /v I JUST LOVE THESE PEOPLE AND THEY WERE SO CUTE TOGETHER /v The black girl is beautiful /v I bet she changed her final opinion right after she heard him said he wouldn't date her /v this is the cutest and the most good vibe date!!!  this is like a bff date!  awww! /v her voice is very attractive btw /v Anyone else hear Super gay whenever they say Soul Pancake at the end of each vid? No, just me? Ok /v dang, her speaking voice reminds me of Alicia keyssss so smooth and gorgeous /v Wait wait what?! This is like the most cute and best date I've seen on this channel how could they say they would not date like wtf /v I love them both so much! /v Is it just me or does it seem that she has a hint of Rihanna in her look? \n\nBtw, love the interaction between the two of them. Lovely! /v She looks so much like keke palmer it freaks me out /v Oh my god whens theres next album  /v I'm from Denver Colorado and before he said he's from Colorado I sensed we would say he was. So weird  /v CUTEST and FUNNIEST one yet!!  /v THE pentatonix? seriously? /v THEY ARE SO CUUUUTE /v that's basically biromantic /v they would make beautiful babies lol /v Either ur gay, straight, or retarded /v Fuckin Fags /v BALTIMORE STAND UP! (: /v Wants someone educated but doesn't know what rural means? LOL...child please /v she's very attractive /v Yes you can assume someone's sexuality based on their appearance /v There are only 2 genders male and female /v She reminded me so much of Halsey /v I thought the guy was gay when I started the video. /v this man is out here singing The Baddest Girl out of all the Pentatonix songs he could have picked that's how you know he's a true stan /v That guys suit is too big. He needs to visit a tailor. /v who is she??? what's her ig??? she is beautiful!!!  /v He's mad cute /v They both have great personalities. /v I dont think many people wanna date inside their race just sayin /v I thought he was gay, when he walked on the scene. Knowing that sexuality is more fluid, I still think he's gay/queer-- regardless of how he identifies. However, I respect his identity. That is how I feel. As for Portia, I would have never guessed she was bisexual. \nRegardless, my assumption was he was on the LBGT+ spectrum. \nAlso, I think him wearing that suit, was a give away. He almost seemed uncomfortable in it. It was look big, and didn't seem to fit who he is.\n\nAND, and the way they parted ways-- they should have been instant BFFs. I wanted them to walk out together singing the theme song to Golden Girls!! /v I FREAKING EXPLODED WHEN HE SAID PENTATONIX THEY ARE NY LIFE YES I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN ALREADY DANG COME GET ME BOO /v Yes, you can assume whatever you want before getting to know somebody. It's just a matter of if you're right or not. You can do plenty of things, just because it's possible doesn't make it right. /v Please tell me that they're still friends irl /v Can I watch there wedding now /v Their connection was amazing. /v he's a pentatonix fan and he's lgbt.. this is some good content /v I would LOVE to meet her  /v Calling it THE Pentatonix got me feeling heated, like nope get your facts straight /v They are so cute. She gives me a Janelle Monae vibe. The guy is very handsome. I thought he was gay within the first 10 seconds, although he says he's pan. /v They both seem great. Enjoyable to watch! And I love that they both have beautiful singing voices. /v He's so cute /v I had the hugest smile the whole time /v i chip both of them /v god this is like actual FRIENDSHIP GOALS /v Who else thinks he looks like Kel Mitchell /v Well I guess they were both too gay to be in a relationship together /v When you ship them so hard but then they friendzone either. I'm not even mad. They do give off a friend vibe more than a significant other vibe. /v LOVELY JUST LOVELY I JUST REALLY ENJOYED There conversation with each other. /v Okay so from a guys perspective - from the UK. Where we say everything exactly how it is and to the point. Not like our American cousins who sugar coat the truth in order not to offend...\n\nI feel as though this could of went down a whole other way, if the guy had given off more of a manly vibe about him. He didn't exactly come across like he either knew what he was supposed to be doing (i.e. naive in dating) or that he just came across as more feminine. Things such as little gestures like head shaking when saying beyonc and that whole ohh hey gurl ...vibe. Probably instantly put her off. As for her... Well he wasn't exactly trying to find compatibility in terms of sexual connection so the whole thing seemed doomed from the early stages, for me.\n\nThat's just what you guys would call throwing my 2 cents worth in... /v I'm totally being racist here but i think blacks have innately amazing voices I! /v THIS IS THE CUTEST ONE YET /v They hit it off right away!  /v I wish I could date a pansexual, but I'm pretty sure that even my brain is ugly. X'D /v The cutest ever!!! /v YES!

Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said: 'Sell him to me,' and he bought him for two black slaves. Then he did not accept the pledge from anyone until he asked: 'Is he a slave?'\nGrade : Sahih (Darussalam) \nReference : Sunan an-Nasa'i 4184\nIn-book reference : Book 39, Hadith 36\nEnglish translation : Vol. 5, Book 39, Hadith 4189 /v Tell me something now /v Say N I G G E R! /v So many racist crack heads!!!!

You don't typically deal with uncompressed lossless files (e.g. bmp, the netpbm formats, raw images), but rather png (more or less row by row zip compression), gif (lossless if you fit the 256 color palette) or other lossless images. /v This guy's content is just as good if not better than Thoughty2 so how come that bloke has more than twice the subscribers? /v Whoever did your makeup did a terrible job. /v 0:53 idk whether its intentional or not, or maybe i heard him wrong, Tom said the worng worms instead of the worng words i thiing its intentional, and it makes me like Tom even more. keep up the great vids! /v the Huffman coding was one of the questions in algorithm test last semester and everybody got a different answer at the end. it seems easy but the calculations are a bit confusing especially if you're not allowed to use calculators. /v I had to write this algorithm for one of my CS classes...using ADA. /v That was very interesting...the more you know eh? /v 0:54 I see what you did there :D /v texting. destroyer of youth a pox on humanity. /v what if (or when) AI came up with more efficient ways of compressions? /v the animating in this was so smooth! /v Great and very interesting as always! /v wouldn't the theoretically best method be to use a tree that used, not just letters, but sequences longer than individual digits? such as 2-digits, or even whole words (Each of which would be followed by a space, essentially removing the need for the space to be in the huffman tree). such as the 200 most frequently used words in a novel + individual letters in order to assemble those that don't fall under the top 200? i'm betting this is, indeed, how more advanced implementations of huffman's coding works. /v Why not do this series together with computerphile? /v You should check out Joanthan Panicker's (actual spelling) channel, he's got a pretty savage bird and he found 60000000000000000000000000 dollars. /v An easy trick is to build the tree dynamically. Forinstance,  for 'wicky wild wild', make a tree of all letters with frequency set to 0, encode 'w', rebuild tree for 'w' with frequency 1, encode 'i', rebuild tree for 'i' with frequency 1, and so on. Encoder and decoder read the letters in the same order, produce the same tree. /v Wow the writing... SO GOOD !! /v Why does this amazing explanation has to be released after my semester exams??  /v How is a space compressed? /v Sending the wrong Worms? So, you send Worms Crazy Golf instead of Worms World Party? /v Doesn't the Huffman tree suffer the problem of having variable length encoding for characters? How do you know when one coded letter ends and the new one begins? /v Tom, what sort of bet did you lose to have to work 'Wicky wicky wild wild west' into a video? /v It is quite nave to think that english is 8 bit characters... /v lossy text compression using natural language processing is totally a viable thing, but it probably isn't easy /v 0:54 Worms ahahahah I see what you did there /v Hi Tom, thanks for these! We spoke a while back about doing some videos like this for GCSE Computer Science students, this is perfect. Hope the trial goes well and you fancy doing some more :-) /v haHA!!! Worms. I don't get it? /v Love it when a youtube video makes me feell like I lerned something. Tbank you, Tom /v sending the wrong WORMS  haha , I see what you dis there ! /v great video!  I have been wondering this for quite a while (but been too lasy to look it up ...) /v I thought it was: take the most common words, assign a brand new character to each of them, and insert whenever that character comes up. /v @0:52 haha send the wrong worms? nice one! /v Really amazing video quality. Something very different this time. I love your channel... /v What is the work joke? I don't get it /v Can you please do videos based on computer science 2210 whole theory syllabus? I really need help with my exams which are on October. I hope you see this message. Please like this so he can see. I never comment on YouTube videos. And I really want to get good results on this exam. My computer teacher sucks. I'm desperate. /v The only thing better than being the best is mathematically proving you are the best. /v This one of only two things I remember from my programming module - the other is a habit of typing both the open and close brackets at the same time. /v i think i understood that... /v I like the series /v If you break in to house and steal cold cuts out of fridge are you then a hamburglar /v You missed range and arithmetic encoding :-) /v Nice job with this... /v Tom! This video leaves me wanting for so much more!! /v now do GZIP/7z/RAR... jpg/png/bmp... mp3/wav/ogg... i gots to know /v what ya gonna do when you hit 1mill subs?\nPS really love the series /v Can't wait for the video on zip files :) /v Or as it's known today; Huffcod. /v I feel like an expert /v I hate it when I send the wrong worms /v I love this series. If you decide to continue, I would be very much for it! /v These series are great, Tom. You have a knack for explaining complicated concepts intuitively without losing what's important. Do you use any unconventional techniques for understanding the concepts deeply enough to capture the gist of them like this? My current strategy is reading and trying to incorporate the concept in my current knowledge base, but it usually takes 2-3 readings to do. /v I know about this stuff already but still watch it because Tom Scott is a good lad /v This is magic. I've just finished my text compression algorithm in C++ the day before yesterday, and this video was uploaded. I feel I'm being observed. /v Hoffman ripped off Euclid but a search tree is a elemtry algorithm /v Why can't I give you 5 likes for this video :-( /v THANK YOU TOM SCOTT!! I have wondered how compression like this worked for the better part of a decade, and I've even put a decent amount of time into researching it, but it never clicked until this video.  You have the best content on this entire platform, both in subject matter and quality. /v ... send the wrong worms. Ha! I see what you did there! /v And I can apply Huffman to save the Huffman tree, and the Huffman code, or again. So actually  we are just trading space for work, right? Or storing information into work? That's cool. Maybe it's what the universe is doing right now, unveiling its stored  Huffman code through chemical reactions. /v Yeah, cool stuff. I'll just keep using my golang gzip/(whatever your preference is) library since I'm trusting scientists to do this for me. Seriously, I'm too busy actually building things irl to re-invent the wheel just for fun. /v I wrote a full on huffman compressor for fun once. I was disappointed that it only yielded about, like you see here, 30% compression (leaving 70% the original size.) I figured I did something wrong. /v I read the thumbnail as How Computers Computers Text /v As usual, darned fascinating! Please continue with the series. I know _some_ stuff but I'm learning lots! /v Always wanted to say that I love your voice, Tom. This is actually the reason why I subbed. /v Can we please get into foreign characters? /v You should keep doing this kind of videos, it was enjoyable and really informative - don't get me wrong I always learn something from your vids, but this was one of a kind- /v I love this channel so much /v Tom, thank you for reminding mr how good Youtube can be. /v Cnt u leve out ltrs nd jst hve a way to ad thm in at th end? So long as ech wrd is uniq or has cntxt clus? /v Wow I can hear the buzz from the old monitors that's funny /v This guy is vsauce IT edition /v Now i understand why windows have 64 bits and 32 bits.. \nwow thanks sir!! :D\nEdit: by that i mean\n64^64 or 32^32 bits \nRight? :) /v where did you get two working BBC model B computers? - haven't see one for a couple of decades /v I love you and your vimeos. /v xz -9ev some_huge_file.txt  (now let's wait a few days) /v 0:50 Otherwise you wind up sending the wrong worms\nI see whatcha did thar... /v Next vid will be intermediate and cover zip files.\n\nThe way you explain things makes everything easy to understand! /v So you're telling me Will Smith *wasn't* rapping about the Wild Wild West wiki I'm sure exists about that movie? /v 0:50 ...sending the wrong *worms*  I see what you did there =D /v Op nj a senf wreng worms /v Did he just? /v I want more /v ...the wrong worm.

Grats!! /v Please Remove Background Noise /v Wah Huffman Coding is so clever... /v the wrong worms  /v How big Weissman score can the algorithm achieve? /v Very informative!!! Ive read about Spartan law and ive came away with more watching this.. hopefully next youll do some about spartan kings and there stories /v Am i the only one thats seeing black spots inbetween the square people 15:15 /v Friggin' A, I love these videos /v This system of government is so insanely bad and vulnerable to abuse that it is a miracle that this state lasted so long.... /v We Spartans are the strongest!!!\n\nAnd then the Roman Legions arrived. xD /v not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame. /v All of these optical illusions with the bunched up squares /v You make such great videos! /v to me [degeneracy] sounds like they were just having a good time\nAnd that is why the West is dying. History tells some hard truths that we refuse to aknowledge because we are too weak willed to  offend someone, or take initiative. /v this is really interesting. before this video i did not have the slightest idea about how the spartan state operated /v So that's why Sparta fell, feminism. It all makes sense now. /v I had no idea that Sparta's political system was so unusual. Thanks for a great video. /v Love the conclusion , super interesting video , hope to see more like these . /v I always knew Aristotle was lame. /v Please, do the Athenian Democracy next. They had many Elements in common with the Spartan system but without kings or the council of elders. /v This is a hell of a way to celebrate 9/11 /v Really interesting. Going to use this for my D&D campaign for sure. /v Well this video blown up /v Wow, usually your videos are really great, but this one completely blew me away. I didn't know much about the spartans, just that they were very conservative. Wow. Keep up the excellent work! /v Pls more of these videos and make them longer /v It were the women that brought down the fall of Sparta. /v In Xenophon the X is pronounced like in the word x-ray not like z /v I learned a lot. Seriously, 3 minutes from one of your vids is worth like 5 modern BBC documentaries. /v Is y'all safe?! /v When the Romans conquered Sparta and its lands, were the Spartans forced to live by the Roman law/customs? Or did they keep up (part) of their own culture?\nGreat video btw, loads of information; but packed clean and clear. Well done. /v the spartans had slaves that allowed the entire population to live like aristocracy and devote their time to war. We have so much technology that much of what is needed to run a society is done my machines overseen by a few people. We could use this to shorten the average work week to something like ten hours but capitalism lives off growth and would never allow this. there will always be new jobs until we implement a universal basic income. we could be the new spartans. we could live like kings off the fruits of our technology. sure, some work still needs to be done but not as much as is currently being done. 60% of people in britain believe their job is actually unnecessary.\n\nwhen self driving cars take all the jobs from truck drivers and taxi drivers, capitalism will create new jobs for them or leave them unemployed and in poverty. what if instead we realised that we have less work to do as a society and the same amount of people. implement a UBI and allow people to work less. \n\nhumanity has pushed the frontiers of science and technology for thousands of years. its time to relax and live off the fruits of our labour.\n\nif you ask people what they would do with a universal basic income nearly everyone has an idea of something productive they would do. maybe theyd do charity work or start a business or study. if you ask people what other people would do with a UBI, nearly everyone responds the same theyd just spend it on cigarettes and alcohol. theyre wrong.\n\nCapitalism is not the future and communism is not the only alternative. the time is ripe for a UBI /v Spartiates were forbidden to take foreigners into their numbers, fertility declined from inbreeding, thats a big part of why their numbers declined. /v Kings did not have unlimited power. Look at thucydides accounts /v Holy shit #46 on trending!  I don't know what that actually means but it sounds great for the channel.  Props! /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Superb! As always! Thanks a lot! /v ya tragic way to go. Simply not enough people to sustain a culture :(. Sure maybe less people died in combat due to rigorous  lifelong training but there are still things like disease, natural disasters, and at no extra cost an occasional helot revolt /v Ah bruh let me design some t shirts for you so you can make some dough /v I thought Sparta was averse to going to war because they were worried their slaves would rise up, rather than the men engaging in debauchery. /v Congrats on getting to top vids, man! /v Best history channel on YouTube.  Well done, man. /v The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\n\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\n\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population /v ALL THE GREEKS JOINED ALEXANDER THE GREAT,ONLY THE SPARTANS STAYED BEHIND FOR FRAPE!!!\n\nHORIS LOGIA!!! /v Wasn't there a class of non-citizen freemen who lived in the Spartan lands? If I remember correctly they mainly did the jobs that were seen as above the Helots but beneath the Spartans proper, such as a good deal of the merchant work, as well as serving in the army if called upon. In fact if my memory of my undergraduate reading doesn't fail me it was actually possible for these freemen to be elevated into full Spartanhood under very special conditions and with the support of a Spartan citizen. /v Please, make  battle of stirling bridge,but without William Wallace throwing fire through the eyes and thunder through the butt.\nI love your history videos. /v It's nice to see how popular this channel is. There is so much junk on You Tube it's nice to see some people still have class. Hail Caesar o.o/ /v 22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure. /v Wow, they sound like they have a pretty Democratic system. /v Waiting forever for another one of his videos, good lord I love them :) /v Sounds like the Gerousia were kinda detrimental to the whole thing. /v I've seen an in-depth historian's account on the Spartan mythos that debunks a lot of their image as the dominant Greek military power.  Long story short, tales of the Battle of Thermopylae became overblown propaganda, even corrupting the perceptions of Sparta pre-Persian invasion.  It wasn't until much later that Sparta got a strong, sophisticated military, perhaps just from trying to live up to their new reputation.  Self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.  Only really relevant to the opening of this vid.  As always, thanks for all this fascinating info! /v And here comes Rome to fuck all y'all shit up /v Probably their government got big and ate the honest citizenry. /v The artstyle and general visual digestion of this video is quite spartan. /v Is this video about the constitution of Sparta or Spammers? Cause your comments section is unusually infested. /v I believe not every ancient authors were uncritically admiring of Sparta. They suffered a pretty nasty defeat against Thebes at Leuctra, after all, and it was downhill from then on. It's a pretty important battle in ancient military strategy, I hope Historia Civilis covers it some day. /v It didn't help when the Spartans killed their babies to see if they were perfect or not. /v DAYUM! You shit on their entire system of government at the end!! Maybe all the hommies moved out cause they wanted to have a little fun? /v Ah the Gerousia, my fallback for when someone who doesn't understand statistics talks about how life expectancy in ancient times. /v ...My God, and I thought Rome's government was confusing. I've rewatched this many times, and I honestly followed Rome better than this shitfest. Holy hell man... /v Are you going to do the wars with Persia? /v You had no business dismissing Aristotle for criticizing extreme wealth and luxury. He was totally right - and pretty much all the other ancient philosophers have the same criticisms of the elites of their societies. Great video otherwise, but that one point was surprisingly stupid. /v Firstly, in the From Democrats to Kings, Michael Scott narrates a lot of battles throughout the V and IV B.C centuries and also how warfare evolved to something more killing efficient. I don't remember if it was him or someone who was debating on the specific topic of Sparta's declining military prowes, but it was a point that the continous loss of men able to fight and also the inability for the Spartans to change that was responsable for it's eventual decline. I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks? Ha! I will see myself out. /v Their was nothing glorious about Sparta they were a dictatorship fascism slave society, it was doomed to fail. /v When you say that a spartan male reached adulthood he received land from the state im pretty sure that only Spartan citizens received land. And to be a citizen you had to pass the Agoge (spartan military education) not simply come of age /v 1:14 The Spartans didn't really speak the same language. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nxD4GDJXCw /v Wern't the Spartans defeated in a battle with Thebes, before Macedon conquered Greece? /v I wish you mentioned the messenians. /v Wow, you got a trending video! /v I love the Rome videos and don't want them to end, but I'm super-psyched that you're expanding your territory. Keep it up! /v the roman rectangle at the end gave me goosebumps :D /v One reason for their decline may be that citizenship was hereditary, and that one punishment for lawbreaking was loss of citizenship.  Whether a convicted man and his descendants became Helots, I don't know, but he & his were barred from military service. Over time, then, the pool of recruits simply dried up.  Or so I've read.... /v Sweet it is #46 on trending videos! I love these videos! I have watched them all. /v For some reason, the big Roman square at 23:09 scared the hell outta me. /v Awesome ! Who is now waiting for Raz Battles video ? /v At first I thought the opening words were yours, I almost clicked off it was so pretentious xD /v one of the best videos I ever saw on youtube good job !!!! /v Dude, what do I have to pay for you to crank out two of these videos every week? /v The constitution of the Spartans must have been pretty good. It does take a lot of endurance to hold those shields and spears. /v If I had some practice and the time in my day, I'd make a Historia Britannia: A History of Britain and her Colonies. /v roolllllllll up!!!! /v Edifying as always /v Absolutely amazing video, thanks! /v Dang #24 on trending fucking well done dude /v This is SPARTA  /v Sall good dawg I LOVE YOU MAN!!! /v zoo wee mama /v Greece+Italy=Brothers /v TRENDING WHAT /v Spartan privilege /v Holy shit you channel on trending /v maybe athens next? /v Fucking elevator/waiting music. /v S'all good, dawg /v THIS IS SPARTA!!! /v Gimme your piglets! /v FASCINATING! /v love your videos man /v S'all good dawg /v Best channel.\n\nXenophon ftw. /v wow, that ending! /v *THIS\nIS\nSPARTA* /v Please stop injecting your modern/fashionable political views into historical documentaries thnx /v Does Xenophon have something to do with xenophobia? /v I didn't know J.D. Stillwater was a Ephor! 13:02 /v This washed up old hag takes ZERO responsibility for the loss she blames progressives, Comey and the media then the has the audacity to claim she's the embodiment of the Democratic party, really? She's a corrupt corporate shill nobody likes republican, independent or democrat! /v Nothing but a total rewriting of history.  Complete garbage. /v The repetitive liar said in the debate she would accept the results if she lost. She has been whining and blaming everybody ever since.  A devious liar all the way around /v It's so obvious Killary paid for the spot on MSM to promote her book.

Note to Jane Pauley: History was being made no matter who won the presidency. You could say that history was made because Trump is the first billionaire president. Maybe it's more accurate to say a first-in-history was being made with a first female president /v She probably refused to sit down with a man /v Pure evil. How this person could win the popular vote is mind boggling. She is the epitome of all that is wrong with politics and the country in general....along with Obama, Soros, etc. Anyone who voted for her should feel immense shame and regret. This isn't even politics or left vs. right. This is a sad disgusting human being. /v That like to dislike ratio tho /v Guys Guys you don't understand, it does not matter what she says or does, the basic fact is It was her turn XD /v I cant get enough of all those blubbering women's looksof shock /v Donald Trump should thank Hillary a million times for fulfilling his dream of being POTUS. He would have never have won against Bernie Sanders. /v A book commercial disguised as a news report.  Not fooling anyone. /v You've GOT to be kidding me. This is the most pre-pubescent emotional tantrum like reaction I have ever seen from a human that is supposed to be an adult. MEDIA STOP GIVING THIS WOMAN A PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO PREACH! Want to actually help? Focus your media money and attention on any of the MANY female candidates for the future presidency. Oh, but I guess thats too gosh dang logical. Better to whine and suck clinton koolaid. /v She blames white people...and still doesn't understand why she was steamrolled /v This is the face of the Democrat party. The dumbest candidate EVER to run for ANY office. She stood for nothing....she did nothing....and she got NOTHING! /v I had not drafted a concession speech     That mindset is what made her lose. /v Im a victim. It was the Macedonian hackers and racist white people that ruined it for me. /v Former first lady of a rapist..

Hillary talking to herself in the mirror /v  Hillary Clinton Speeks ..... Ugh....she's speaking again? Ok I admit it, she sure is strong woman, she wants to get right back out there and play the victim again! /v Omg, what a crybaby. Hillary played dirty and she lost. Stop bitching about it, you were not liked amongst Bernie supporters, people saw you as the career politician you are, that lies and cheats her way into a potential position she thinks she deserved. You are a hack and fake person. /v I wish Hilary won....sad trump is president....now Ima go back to Mexico /v Hm there's no way those dislikes could get any higher, must be the damn Russians hacking youtube. /v Oh yes you totally lost because you were a women not because you're a puppet. /v 8:28 I say I've heard just as much as of Russia, as I've heard about her email server. /v Why the UK flag in her house though? /v we all fall and rise: she is so relatable i almost forgot about the pedophilia and the war /v Lmfao she just cant accept the truth. She dug her own grave. Shes even throwing sanders under the buss when he told the left to vote for her after her and the DNC cheated him out of any real chance he had at all. /v I am completely certain that this woman would have had us at war with Russia by now. /v I thought this was a video to help you go to sleep from the title  /v Roaches always return /v Hillary Roduptheass Clinton. /v LOCK HER UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v ooooh Bernie sanders? /v Wait, Jane Pauley  still around? /v That not Thet /v Trumptards hate truth.... how sad /v she sure does /v I love Hillary I voted for her! /v She inadvertently reveals why she, and perhaps no other woman, should be President. the results of the election had her laying down on a bed, she was unprepared for any outcome than the one she wanted, was gob-smacked, and drank too much from the trauma of not getting her way. She is not only unfit for the Presidency, she is unfit for any position off any responsibility at any level. /v Her book should be titled, Damn I can't even beat him?     I wish she would just fade into the background already. How miserable  must life be to want to read this book. /v The like to dislike ratio to this video is just hysterical. /v Closet Cleaning Long walks into the woods sounds like she was hiding some skeletons in her closet /v She is scared of Trump grabbing her the know what, she have a young secret service pretend to be Trump? not make much sense and it's funny! /v Why she wasn't President cuz The People didn't want her .... /v Does this evil woman even realize how offensive and how ugly of a human being she is?  It is obvious she is delusional and very stupid! /v May God bless her with a nice brain tumor! /v 23k deplorables and envious of others gains thumbs down this video, including russian bots. /v She talks about long walks in the woods, she should of stayed in the woods... /v What Happened was You Lost Hillary and time to Accept the reality /v So she made no mistakes at all? It was everyone else's fault? /v I'll have to live with that the rest of my life. Yeah, hopefully that isn't much longer. She has the blood of countless Americans on her hands. /v Um, so, really she pointed the finger at everyone but herself /v Why is she still in the public eye? SORE LOSER /v This is propaganda at it's worst. /v My unbias opinion of Hillary is that she lost because she was arrogant, careless and obviously dishonest. she can't even be honest about what he did after she lost the election...or why she lost.. Long walks cleaning out closets... She insults all her supporter with her effortless obvious lies,  her supporters look like idiots because they believe her and then the truth come out they look like idiots /v Lips moving, lying. Look at her eyes, she does not even believe her own lies. /v The like to dislike ratio is perfect. /v Oh... And I thought she was going to retire with this video.... Oh and Ha Ha /v SHE called the President?? I thought the President called her and told her to concede. I think she is still trying to rewrite history. /v Ha she lost to trump he didn't even try for like a year /v WTF is she wearing?  Her home decorating is dreadful, so banal and cold (like her). /v Whoops! She's talking. Watch her polls drop. /v *Dislikes*\nI'm doing my part, are you doing yours? /v 23K dislikes and counting. I wish DNC gives her the nomination again to end the party and liberal lunatics once for all! Hillary- Chelsea 2020, the end of the Democratic Party. /v She is Ka Ka Ka Crazy.. .She said Trump stalked her!! if you look at the debate video, which i have at least a dozen times... it was she that walked near him then stopped near him . he did not come near her, are get anywhere near her space..  While Trump stayed behind his Podium the whole Time. She is not only KRAZZZZY but she is a Pathological LIAR and sociopath. . /v She wonders why?\nGee...could it be \nyour lying ? Or maybe that your fiasco in Benghazi? Or perhaps it was when you coughed up hair balls? /v She's totally lost it.  It would be sad if it weren't scary that she still plans on being in politics, albeit not as a campaigner. /v She should be in prison /v Oh we'll have a female president\n\n\n\n\n*just not her* /v She is an embarrassment to politics.  Please shut her up! /v I'm doing my part! /v So, Hillary is going on her comeback campaign and the media is going to whitewash all.the crooked things she did. I seriously doubt anybody in the liberal media have given the things she's done even a second glance. Most I suspect don't even know. But they choose to remain ignorant, preferring to dismiss it as right wing bias. /v TrumpHappened.Com #TrumpHappened!;) #StayTheCourse & #ChangeBackThewOrld!

Very retrograde and now. Wolf Alice are the band I been waiting for and never disappoint. Love all the other new stuff too. The band remind me of SATB. Joel could be Budgie, Theo, Severin, even Joff could be McGeoch/McKay, although Ellie is unique in her own way. /v !  \n,   .   . /v Wish this song was longer /v Sounds like they've been hanging out with Black Honey quite a bit... /v Shit dropped harder than the twin towers /v This video's Wolf Alice's answer to In Bloom but Ellie's image in this reminds me of Shirley Manson or Beth Gibbons. She's already up there with those singers /v they may be labour CUCKS but I like their music. /v that was actually rather good.. /v Ellie is hot af omg i love everything about her! I wanna be her! /v Ellie hating every second of this video. /v I think it's just awesome.\nHere a lots awesome design;https://goo.gl/Gg7HNh /v ELLIE <3 /v I have class early tomorrow but I can't take my eyes off of Ellie.

I'm in love. /v JMJ brought in Beck's vibe and that's cool yeaahhh /v Dudeeeee, Ellie makes me feel so damn gay. I'm lesbian overflowing right now. Good song btw /v It would be awesome to have all the footage where Ellie looks at the camera, yes. The entire time.\nShe is gorgeous in this video. Of course, the boys also are rocking it in their tailored suits!\n\nDefinitely a beautifully unconventional video from Wolf Alice! /v Wow I never check trending but I did tonight and one of my favorite bands is on here.

Such a cringe fest every new song and the comments are an 11 year old circle jerk /v You know what was great about this trailer? It hyped me up for the show without giving away any spoilers, a basic promotional technique that most trailers today have forgotten how to use. /v i've never seen this show but just from this trailer it looks pretty damn funny /v ...do you like a chip and a dip? /v I am so excite for your returning, Lawrence!!

All the money in the world and still f'n miserable. /v Did he need to finance a new summer home? Oop, better make a new season. Not that I'm particularly complaining, I love his comedy... but it does seem strange that he comes out with a season here and there, every now and then. /v Is that Michael Fassbender at 1:13 ? /v The only hero I have left. /v Is this a Curb your ____ meme? /v You vote this down.

( For research purposes ) /v 2:11 that was  remarkably detailed /v I really injoy you're videos man !! keep up the good work ! /v Exactly how I feel in these scenarios. I just say it's probably not worth it and I go about my business as usual. I foresee more loneliness in my future but I also foresee no divorce settlements, which means I at least get to keep all my shit. My shit is important. /v Casual explained, I know this is off topic but I was re-binge watching your videos and in your Casually explained - The future YOU ACTUALLY PREDICTED THE IPHONE X.\nCan I just say it is an honor to watch an amazing Psychic such as yourself. /v This is about like 5 levels of too real yikes well done though /v if its a guy, well. ur not gay. if u kiss a guy u kissin all the other girls he kissed n shi u feel me /v Better to be safe than happy.  /v Wait What? There is background music? Never noticed that before. /v I rarely dislike your work but this one seemed forced to me. I dont want to discourage you but it is way slopier than the most of your work. Im saying this because i love your videos man keep it up. /v The worst that could happen? You end up married with 3 kids only to have the bitch divorce you and force you into paying for her shit for 18 years along with seeing your kids only on weekends while she uses those weekends to get boned by a unemployed shitbird while you are forced to work into your 80s due to your retirement fund being relabeled child support and alimony. Have fun chasing that ass guys. /v I can't be the only one who actually thinks like this? /v I don't have to approach girls to tell if they are interested. I can tell by body language and they don't have mutual feelings. I just want to live in peace and stop being attracted to women. Women only want the winners (according to society's standards $$). I want to program my mind to have a negative view of what women look like and not be attracted to them. /v Wow this was the best one yet also worst, I feel personally attacked. /v Wait, so you're telling me I'm RIGHT about how I handle attractive woman? That's not normal according to EVERYTHING else, but I like this more, so imma roll with it! /v In the thumbnail. Who is the chick in the middle?

TRIGGERED /v Can relate. The one and only time in my life i had a girl try to pick me up at a bar I was so afraid she was going to rob me I blew her off. Sure I might have lost my virginity half a decade earlier but I still think i probably dodged a gang-robbery lol. I sometime wonder though... /v Hahaha these videos are for losers.

If you watch I video like this, probably no.\nWhat's the worst that could happen? Depends on the size of ya town. /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUalqi6oVOc raw ass rapper from Chicago that's very slept on. /v I guess the worse thing that could happen out of the top of my head is you tell her you have deep feelibgs for her she tells you that she has deep feelibg for you as well but wants to take it slow and not rush into a relarionship and then she leaves for 2 months to her old city and she wants you to go but you have a new job and no money so one of her guy friends tag along she stops talking to for the whole trip then she comes back and tells you her and the guy are now dating and have been for 3 weels now you try to get some kind of explonation and then she does a total 180 and tells you that you didnt understand her and that she had deep feelings for me only as a friend and then you bring up the time you two almost kissed and she says that never happened and she says that she still wants to be friends I guess that would be the worst that could happen. /v this is literally me everyday /v Yep...unfortunately, that's about right. /v anyone else ever know a girl, befriended her, joked with her, she gave you nicknames and told you about past experiences, then you fell in love with them, then they forget you the next school year? Happened to me, twice! /v Oh. I thought this was one of those crappy movie reviews. /v Hahahahaha this is so good /v I hope people actually understand the well played sarcasm here and see the meaning lol /v Casually Explained, that last one was oddly specific.

Or being accused of being part of the campus rape culture. 95% of females wearing ear buds....Meanwhile, attractive females everywhere are asking what happened to all of the real men. /v Why did 1,000 something people thumbs this down? lol /v What if she keeps sending me nudes and has agreed to go on a date? /v This video is hilarious /v Hahah that was amazing. It's cool how you give advice while joking at the same time /v I fucking pissed myself, that was hilarious /v Holy shit dude, do you live in Victoria? /v This is so depressing. /v Reminds me of the opening scene of idiocracy: www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwZ0ZUy7P3E /v You ask your crush out:\nShe's says she fucking hates you\nShe talks bullshit about you to her friends\nShe ignores you\n\nWhat's the worst it could happen?\nI really can't tell on this one.....\nGo seek better opportunities /v I dont know why but this was oddly inspiring /v I have music, check me out https://soundcloud.com/user-172471921/ungodly-ty-locked-in /v I fucking love these lmfaooo /v  /v Very hungry caterpillar is GOAT /v LOL /v Exclusive carton video https://goo.gl/mGWb7v /v THIS VIDEO /v  /v Nice lol /v Bean water  /v Lost my virginity thanks to you....dick. /v Nick diaz? /v Youre out of ideas /v tomorrow never comes /v WTF!?? Lmao xD I loved this so much!! /v i loves these videos :) /v Discovery Coffee, mm. /v VIRGIIIIINNNSSSSSSS /v Gotta stay away from thots, amirite? /v 1. Great looking, sense of humor, snappy dresser, likes to dance.  Worst that could happen: He's gay, and dating your ex-boyfriend, who you turned gay.\n2. Stable job, good income. Seems to like puns, has a mechanical pencil collection, and names his socks (after Dark Horse comic book characters). Owns an Atari 2600 and brags about it to strangers.  Worst that could happen: Engineer. And gay. And better than you.\n3. First time you met, he went in for the quick-hug, as if you were close friends. And then sniffed your hair. Although he doesn't stare at your chest, which is nice, he does stare at your feet. And said your toes are adorable.  Has a scraggly soul patch. Second-worst that could happen: He is confusing you for a girl he saw on Chaturbate. Actual worst that could happen: You are the girl he saw on Chaturbate.\n4.  You keep running into him at improbable places and times. He acts like he doesn't see you, but gets nervous and runs away when you call him out. You are suspicious that he is a stalker. Worst that could happen: it turns out he's not a stalker, and those were just coincidences. Now you're bummed because you feel like maybe you aren't good enough to stalk.\n5. He has a popular YouTube channel. You think it involves cats. Or cooking. Or cooking for cats. Whatever it is, he has a warehouse full of something called merch, which you think may be some sort of narcotic. Possibly for cats. He brags about his subs and says that he is way more interesting than a Pootie-Pie, whatever the f*ck that means.

So, get a deck of cards and on the bottom card( the one with like 5 of dimands) flip it over. Than, flip the deck over. So than, you get someone to do the trick on. Next, show the deck ( except for the one that is flipped over) and say pick a card. When they take a card, say memorize it. When they are memorizing it flip the deck over. Than say put the card anywhere in the deck. Once they have done that, say let me work my magic. So turn around and search the deck and you will see that it is the only one that is face up. Than put that card on the top of the deck, and make sure that it is facing the same direction as the rest. Take it off of the deck, show the card to them, and say, was this your card?

I actually work at a Kohl's store lol. IF YOU DON'T MIND ASKING, WHERE IS THIS STORE LOCATED IN? :) /v I'm so torn between the hilarity of her still picking all black, and being so ticked she didn't get more colors and styles outside of what she'd normally pick. Those jeans were rockin.  /v Do a video on why moths are so damn dusty /v Good old government saving lives, 12 years at a time. /v really wanted to see a dancing cat :( /v A perfect example of why free market capitalism will never work. /v Thought this was going to be about a murakami novel /v _Trust corporations!

What's that? Sounds like a redundant redundancy to me... /v Maybe this was the cause of disco fever in that medieval village where everyone died /v And the best part? Many places still illegally dump stuff into our waterways. Climate change seems like a box of fluffy ducks compared to the horrors of irreversible polution of our food and water. /v This is silly! There was no need to use mercury to get acetylaldehyde; they could have just transfused Ted Kennedy's blood. PLENTY of acetylaldehyde there for industrial purposes! /v This has gotta be a CATastrophe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you kitten me? Stop it with the puns!\nAnother pun, and I'm gonna become CATatonic\nPlease help me I PURRgot what my name is\nHelp me I word forget like meanings and questions bean apple forever crying apple apple apple apple apple apple\nAhbwi aoajdnmwo sokajsk skjsnis xisjkwnizk wijsjajsh sijsjsjiwj Ijwnwjlws.d.........\n.....................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comment was found on the computer of a 19-year old man in Russia. His name is Alexi Cherekov \nHe died from an apparent stroke /v First thought was: Methylmercury = Birth control\nJudge me as you please. /v Hmm, this made sense of the Bush song Disease of the dancing cats. /v We know so much more about chemistry and biology than we did in the 1950s. The experts at the time thought these chemicals were safe to handle this way. \n\nRemember that...the experts thought they understood this. The experts who tell you everything is ok and say things tbey can't explain like diversity is a strength are often proven wrong after disasterous results. /v  Its all over for orangutans  /v @scishow QQ: why does skin get red and itchy when walking/exercising in the cold? /v Suggestion: Talk about MethylMercury poisoning in Iraq /v Came to see dancing cats, much disappoint. /v Can you do a video on radiotrophic fungi? /v Why do most women get a rash under her bra line? And how do you treat it? :) /v What happened to the president of the chemical corparation. Is he in jail, a free man or does he sleep with the fish? /v I am disappointed that you didn't make the cat-alyst pun /v We all knew the CATions on this video could've made a pun at CATalyst. Dang, he missed his chance! /v 1960's wasn't that long ago.  I wonder how we're poising ourselves today? /v I am a paramedic and jerking and maki g weird noises is called a seizure /v They destroyed the lives of thousands of people through their thoughtless and harmful industrial waste.  Those responsible should pay an eternal debt. /v Sponsored by the tourist board of Japan I guess. /v Free Market Almighty surely was displeased with the government's future meddling with Chisso Corp. These poor folks were simply punished proactively by the powers that be. /v These stories make me think of vigilante justice since the traditional justice system just doesn't work. Consider an experiment to determine if chemical company executives react the same way to such chemicals as people who aren't chemical company executives. All in the name of science! /v When I was a kid there was a pictoral article in Life Magazine. This video did little to convey the horror of what happened to these townspeople. I'm over 65 now and that one article remains as one of  the most traumatic things to ever happen to me. The horror of it can not be conveyed in words. You did an excellent job and I actually thank you for not including pictures of the victoms. /v 3:33 to 3:36 they would jerk around uncontrollably, making terrifying noises, then they would die. I was imagining cats masturbating to death. /v The cats spread their happiness to the humans. ;3 /v *what about the disaster of **music.ly?**?* /v You can also still find mercury in silver dental fillings...all of those are 50% mercury and still in use. /v Thanks for not showing us those poor cats.  I don't want to see that. /v I thought the video was going to be about the cute waving cats you see it oriental restaurants, boy was I wrong. /v and in immunity booster shots..1:18 /v off topic..but i always found it cooler to be a girl. can you make clones of men and remove the y chromosome and replace it with an identical x? i can't seem to find an answer online /v Did the townsfolk kill the head of the company? /v And I thought this monday couldn't get any more depressing... :/ /v Chisso also use yakuza to death threaten and silents the victims. /v Always that corporate greed, I specifically study cases like this caused by corporations and governments and it's sad how often the value of profit over innocent lives is so easily taken as if these people had sold their souls to the devil. Whats worse is they are not punished enough for  the long term damages to their environment that equates pretty much to bio-terrorism and to people who did nothing wrong like he said people died and even worse developing babies were not even spared. If it were up to me  there would be no profitting off the death of innocent citizens and most of the board members  would be in prison for a really long time or on death row. /v How about linking to an Art Assignment or Crash Course history episode that describes why we even know all this - the activism and work of the incredible photojournalist W Eugene Smith and his Japanese wife - <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Uemura_in_Her_Bath rel=nofollow noopener target=_blank>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Uemura_in_Her_Bath</a> and <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Eugene_Smith rel=nofollow noopener target=_blank>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Eugene_Smith</a> /v really could have used this video a year ago when I had to do a report on Minimata Disease... better late than never, I guess? /v Aaaand in the least shocking twist ever, the people running the corporation killed a bunch of people and wouldn't take responsibility but somehow people still think that regulating corporations is bad. /v here's an idea: when ever these greedy corporate criminals want to dump poisonous elements, they can start with their own back yards. and they can let THEIR kids play back there. how would that be? /v Pet peeve is when Youtubers can't pronounce words from whatever country they are talking about. /v Was Scott Pruitt head of the Japanese version of the EPA in the 60s before he came to the US? /v First cats then humans. That's just really sad. They should have done something the moment they saw something wrong with the cats!\n\nNormal people don't have anything to do with dumping mercury yet they still had to suffer for it! /v After watching this, I went through several Minamata disaster videos. They are just horrific. Death is far better than this disease. \nGod bless us. /v So when they talk about mercury poisoning in tuna, is it the methylmercury? This would make more sense as eating bigger, aka older fish (tuna...) would be more hazardous.  We won't have to worry about extinction..from asteroids...our corporations will do it for us. /v This is what regulations are for /v T-shirt game is on point for this one.... /v 4:54 The _government_ started to clean the bay. Why couldn't the Chisso Corporation be bothered? /v Read about this in This Borrowed Earth for my APES class /v a MAN made preventable disaster,   the CEO's and responsible parties in the chemical company should have been charged with man-slaughter, negligence and environmental destruction,  horrific /v There's a fantastic documentary called The Cove that talks about a lot of this. /v Don't you have a video of the dancing cats?? /v Actually...organic and inorganic compounds don't mix, LITERALLY like oil (organic) and water (inorganic). /v How and why the hell did I already know this... Can't even remember where from... /v No one else made note of no video visual? /v I love how you go more into the chemistry part! Thank you for this, super interesting /v Super informative, guys, thanks for the video! Never heard of this situation before, glad to see it brought out. /v But it gets worse.  The company basically said\n\nIt's so awful what happened to this quaint town.  Because we're so generous and care about our community, we're offering money to those affected.  Only condition is that you waive the right to sue us.  We wouldn't want to bite the hand that feeds us, right? /v Hank, I would argue that Methylmercury is not _the_ most poisonous form of the metal, but the _second_ most poisonous form of the metal. Dimethylmercury seems a lot more poisonous altogether, especially considering its immense ability to penetrate materials, and the fact that the most prominent recorded death from it, that of highly-trained chemistry professor Karen Wetterhahn, resulted from a few accidental pipette drops onto a latex glove. Her entire story can be found here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn), but the sheer toxicity Dimethylmercury demonstrated in this case resulted in its complete abandonment in all but extremely limited research settings. /v Its this kind of lazy that makes me feel guilty i'm as lazy....i am a Pateron though. /v the greatest generation people... /v I remember watching a documentary about this in elementary school. /v Bonus question: Pools of what substance have been floating into neighborhoods in Texas after Harvey? Double bonus: Guess why local chemical plants are refusing to release tier 2 lists of chemicals stored there. /v Are mosquitoes more attracted towards a specific blood group? Please reply. /v So the cats were high on meth /v This video was released very coincidentally for me, I just started reading This Borrowed Earth which covered minamata disease in the first chapter! /v 1:17 There go my weekend plans /v Why the fish unaffected? /v Hank doesn't disappoint. /v Mad Hatters disease /v CATalyst haha... /v CHEESS-SO! NOT SHISS OH! /v What a CATastrophe /v Hurrah unregulated Capitalism. /v Some lite bulbs have it slso /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9UfBkEuLXA /v :( /v Poor cats  /v Hinamizawa syndrome anyone? /v poor kitties, /v Mercury is one of the nastier elements on the periodic table, which is why we don't use it so much anymore...\n\nYeah, except they do put it in the vaccines they keep pumping little kids full of these days. /v Cats will always be better than dogs. Believe me. This is true. You can take that statement to the bank. All the way there. You can take it there. There is whence mightest it shall not never not not go unless it will not go. Make America Great Again! /v But it wasn't until 1968, twelve years after the first victims died, that the Chisso Corporation stop dumping the factories wastewater into the bay.\nWhile technically true, this is libel. Wastewater treatment plants were erected immediately after the discovery that mercury discharge was the problem. What took ten years was the discovery that the treatment process they used was not in fact catching all the mercury. Only then did they modify their processes to end the discharge of mercury. /v How come people are so outraged about this but they aren't upset about the mercury used in vaccines and medications? (This is not an anti vaccine comment. It's an anti heavy/toxic metals comment.) /v What happened to the dickheads of the chisso factory? /v I don't care what happened to the people I'm only concerned about the cats /v the sound of ever new slide is annnnoying as fuck /v I have made an analysis video of the last episode, what a story !\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evD1Pdb7FLw /v A narcissist exaggerates shit but Rick actually does what narcissists think they do , so is he a narcissist or just a totally fucked up god /v lol you can't use the episode of the sigerian scammers for any examples. Rick was smart enough to know from the moment Morty ran into the garage wall that Morty was a digital projection aannnd etc throughout the episode. /v Whoa, whoa, whoa! Exaggerates his achievements? Not Rick. That motherfucker gets shit done! /v My theory is that the Rick we see is from another universe that he came over to his first current one we see him in because that Rick died, which explains the 20 year gap, why he sees Morty as a kid etc. I however do not think that evil Morty is his original Morty, because if that was true Morty would have more evil characteristics as the standard. Since he is the Rickest Rick, I know this might be wrong, but I honestly feel that if evil Morty is his original, it would be to simple and not have the mind screw part that Rick&Morty is famous for. /v Damn the detail in this video... /v Everyone saying Rick isn't a narcissist needs to realize that he literally tells toxic Rick that he had his narcissism removed. So not only is he a narcissist, but he's aware that he is. /v I don;t know if narcissists are insecure but if they aren't, Rick definitely isn't one. /v To be fair you can't say that Rick exaggerates his claims when he really is the smartest being in the multiverse. /v Excuse me, but it's just a cartoon. /v This video just made me realize how shitty my existence is. I see myself in Rick. Except for the intelligent part. Hahaha  /v You ruined the fucking show for me thx /v Please do one on Johnny from The Room - Tommy Wiseau! /v there's a lot of videos on youtube exploring the philosophy and psychology of Rick and Morty, but this video is the deepest. BY FAR.\nThank you so much ScreenPrism <3 /v I don't know why people have such high regard for this cartoon, philosophies are just like religions, beliefs and not fact. /v He's not a narcissist. /v Don't be so rickulously /v Damn girl, Rick and Morty and Game of Thrones  I'm falling in  /v Holy shit my mind is blown /v He has reversed the concept of acting in bad faith. That refers to your reaction to limited choices. Rick has limitless choices. /v This video made me realize I'm a narcissist.  Damn it. /v Evil Morty has the same intelligence as c137 Rick. Rick tought him or artificially made him into a genius. I dont know what happened but some betrayal had to happen. /v When will the answer come? Why do not all people love President Donald J. Trump? He is making America so great. Everything is awesome. I love our Commander in Chief. He is a fine fellow. /v Deep. I just see Back to the Future mixed with parodies of pop culture. But that is just me. /v Why do only bots comment on your videos? /v why is Morty a Morty? /v Evil Morty is now president of the new citadel (under reconstruction) /v How was it in the latest episode the one Rick didn't know how to make Portal Gun juice? Shouldn't all ricks know how to make it? /v He's not a narcissist; he's Rick and the smartest man in the multi-verse; deal with it summer /v Death is an insult /v The rickest Rick of all. /v What if Beth's mom was that petrified creature that Rick killed first before failing to kill himself? /v I think the pickle Rick episode explained Rick's behavior the best why Rick is such a Rick but your doing good to /v I think that he's more a sociopath than a narcissist. While he feels superior, he's aware of many of his shortcomings and mistakes and his depression implicates a low self esteem. I think he hates himself and has even less love for others making him both ruthless and reckless. He further believes in the strong eating the weak and he does not believe in moral values. Still, he's not a psychopath, since there are moments where he does care about things other than himself and psychopaths don't suffer depression or would ever breakdown like he did in Ricklaxation, nor would they ever love someone. /v he doesnt exaggerate his abilities, and he does have a weirdly high tolerance for alcohol /v Song that starts at 8:39? /v It's hard to call him a narcissist when he is fucking right about everything, always achieves impossible feats, and truly has no peer, just makes him self aware i think. /v The entire time I was wishing she'd shut the fuck up so I could enjoy the show,\n                                    *PSYCHOLOGY = PSEUDOSCIENCE*\n\n...\n*I'm Pickle Rick bitches!!!* /v 100k and it's trending? /v EVIL MORTY is in the new episode /v I'm still not totally unconvinced that Rick will become real, step through my screen and shoot me in the face with a 9 gauge plasma pistol. /v Wow\nI just noticed that Rick had memories of picking up baby Morty back when Evil Rick was downloading his memories\nMaybe Rick abandoned Evil Morty after he saw what a monster he had grown into\nEvil Morty knew he couldnt have his Grandfather back so he settled on taking his memories instead\nIdk i may be wrong but Rick picking up Baby Morty raised many questions cuz Rick had abandoned his family right until Morty turned 14\nGreat video btw :D /v Why is Rick such a dick? /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Well the first part is inly partly true, but all his behaviors are fine cuz he can do anything hes know as the smartest man in the universe and multiverse lool /v this proves how great of a show it is /v Hi guys, please subscribe to my channel, every day a new video :) /v Thing about the memory of Rick holding Baby Morty is that the conclusions drawn from it in this video shouldn't be drawn quite so hard, as it is entirely possible that Rick snuck in to Beth & Jerry's life to check out his grandson unnoticed. Always irks me when people say so that couldn't have been current Morty.\n\nReally great video, otherwise. Utterly adore this channel. /v It's simple when you can change your reality at any point then nothing matters. It's the true postmodernist lifestyle nothing is in reality and due to that you become cynical and very nihilistic. And since you control the past present and future everything becomes about you. Which is why it would be point less to even be around someone like that, you'd say the sky is blue and he'd say red, go back in time make it red and then you're wrong. He'd get a rush by being always right and have to top himself constantly until he becomes so depressed he just ends all life to test himself to bring all life back. /v Incorrect the fictitious family was not accidentally killed if they ever existed. /v Rick thinks he's special? naa man he is so special. He's the smartest man in the universe, and has power to basically do anything. /v Real meaning: Why Rick such a Di#k /v Rick does NOT fit most of the requirements of being a narcissist.  Most of those requirements require Rick to be delusional in each respect.  Rick is NOT delusional.  What makes Rick so special is that he does rightfully deserve being able to act like a narcissist without BEING one. /v I had a whole comment written out explaining just how but it's not worth it  \n\nThis video is bad. \n\nIt's boring, contrived, and just fails to understand R&M at a fundamental level. /v Wait what if evil morty is the morty from ricks original dimension with beth, and abandoned that dimension too /v 70,000 views and it's 23 on trending! /v He doesn't really have infinite families. Majority of the other family members are VERY different in other universes. There is a finite curve that exists and shows how even in a sea of infinite universes there is a finite amount of inhabitable ones or ones that are similar enough to ours. There may be an infinite amount of universes, but the finite curve let's Rick know he can't do it at will. When they moved universes in season 1, Rick said himself that they only have a few universes left that fit Rick's criteria for a suitable home. /v I really don't like the citadel(?) episodes because the Ricks are so un-Rick-y. They're actually pretty dumb. /v For a moment, I thought the thumbnail said Why is Rick such a Prick /v More like Why is Rick Such A Dick /v Why is rick such a dick :v /v awesome as always you should do stranger things next....:) /v Wow, just as insightful as wisecrack. How do yall not have more subs?. Keep it up /v Morty = young version of rick\n\n Evil Morty = young version of evil rick /v Rick isn't a narcisist, he is simply put just a nihilist. Let us look at the describtion:\n>>Nihilism (/na.lzm/ or /ni.lzm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\n\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\n\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character. Now if that would be true, it would be really a way of breaking the 4th wall. /v Cause he's the Rickest Rick of all Ricks /v Wubalubadubdub!!! Ahah ahaha! /v Incredibly well done. /v PICKLE RIIIIICCCKKK /v Wow wow wubbzie /v Okay, i'm Rick /v 1:03 same /v If rick is so smart that he's aware of being in a cartoon does that mean that Mr.poopybutthole is just as smart as he is because he's aware of being in a tv show as well? /v R&M=Best mind fuck ever /v Hawkkkk hawkk /v Because he wants that szechuan sauce /v Ohhhhhhh boy. Oooooooo weeeeee /v http://piff.me/4a7a834\nhttps://youtu.be/as9BNv7IzSQ\nhttps://SoundCloud.com/ivyrosetv914\n\nCheck me out  /v Dude, stop being a rick. /v 31 on trending /v PICKLE RIIIICK /v Morty SMITH!? /v Ricki Tiki Tavi BITCHES /v Good vdo I like /v http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=52570 /v Hm /v Lol /v Evil Morty?

Ricks exist for a reason /v I used to enjoy rick and morty. But then the fan base came along and ruined it. Thanks you fuckers. /v You've added too many attributes to the definition of a narcissist a narcissist to someone who basically does not comprehend that there is anyone more important than themselves and that anyone has anything that can't be cancelled or postponed to accommodate the needs of the narcissist.  You combined it with a sociopath. /v I love the narrator's feminine Asian voice. /v Psychology is bullshit. /v WHAT BEAUTY THING SHOULD I LEARN HOW TO DO NEXT?  (I am literally clueless at everything beauty related! I have never even bought my own makeup lmao) /v Anyway you're face is ugly! /v Ren is so sweet! and he was such a nice teacher! great job to both of you! /v I was hoping she would go into the buzzfeed offices and show her co-workers but I forgot she doesn't work there anymore. /v It's Poppi!!!!

Every video of yours is so interesting and empowering! You have such a lovable personality, and it's like you're taking us on a journey with you. /v I love it! So flowy! /v You are unbelievably beautiful and it's not like you need makeup, but you need to feel your own version of beauty!! Regardless, you are absolutely stunning. no matter what you do..you are one of the most beautiful human beings I've ever seen. You're perfect and you're so unbelievably beautiful!!, /v Foh u look the same.... cream pie material /v Finally learned how to use the curling iron now thanks to his tricks yay /v It's better if you don't show the after in the thumbnail.

Maybe you should shave your head, then you might get some attention. /v Is it just me or was Michelle especially giggly today? /v OMG this is the video I have been searching for my whole LIFE !! I have always wanted celebrity hair !  I'm just like you, I never know what to do with my hair and just put it in a low pony tail /v Damn, that ponytail was a hot mess /v i'm gonna use that pony tail trick when my hair grows out! thats so cool. /v What did he put in her hair to make it so shiny? /v Fuck this misleading title and fuck this girl. She is so irritating. All of her thumnails have the same oh im scared but not face. And fuck whoever put this on the trending page. Im glad the ad appoloclyspe happened so people like her will make less and hopefully leave youtube. I hide her videos every fucking time i see them and they keep popping up. Fuck michelle khare. You have a boys body and a personailty as dry as saltines. You are a plain ass bitch that is basic enough to give buzzfeed a hard on. /v Why is this on trending with only 2k views /v Simplynailogical should teach you how to do your nails  /v My heart honestly skipped a beat on the reveal of that last one, holy shit /v You are still not a celebrity /v This video was great!  really informative!

Whaddupp Papi!!!  /v Lol your just blessed enough to be beautiful, you could wear a potato sac and still turn heads! /v Your so pretty I didn't even notice you changed your hair. /v Women be crazy.  You go out take the bitch home and wake up to what the cunt really looks like. It would almost be like discovering the girl was a dude. Dishonest fake disgusting. Watch out for any chick that wears a lot of makeup, guarantee she is a phony in other ways as well.  If you date a girl ,when you go to her place checkout her makeup collection if there is a lot of it run... /v Am I the only person with eyes that can see that there wasn't any difference.... /v You were gorgeous before the makeover. \n\nI'd be proud to be with a girl as gorgeous as you are. Stop worry about what others think of you!

Love this video <3 /v But you look the same before and after...  /v whoever thought of lilly : D /v NO ONE GIVES A FUCK. /v #17 on trending! Keep up with the awesome work :) /v I think you should do a makeup class at Sephora or somewhere like that, it would be a cool video if you then took what you learned and made makeup looks out of it for a week. /v Hi renee know you from iisuperwomanii -lilly singh /v I knw him from superwoman yey /v Your hair looks amazing naturally just saying!

Thanks! /v Tutorial on this makeup look?? /v Ingrid I love you!!! Pls pls make more videos  /v I don't trust any products she recommends anymore because half the time I don't know if its a secret ad or if she actually uses them /v You are welcome US for finally getting Aritzia, from Canada, with love   Aritzia is a danger zone store for me! /v the similar Aritzia zipper body suit you have in the description looks like nothing like your vid. /v i am obsessed with the dry shampoo! /v Does anyone know what lipstick she's wearing?? /v Do you have issues with getting small holes in your t shirts? I don't know if it's just because I purchase cheap shirts, but I'm hesitant to splurge because I'm afraid it may happen anyways /v This video gave me life. /v Ingrid, the Aveda shampure dry shampoo is a dry shampoo powder! It's my HG! I think the scent of it is right up your alley!! /v Aritzia always has the cutest things. Great video Ingrid. /v Ingrid! Please do more of your 'fashion foreplay'!! Would love to see your outfits for fall this year:) /v Please do a closet tour /v I still remember when you used to wear that panda sweater  /v Not to be rude but your channel is dying. /v Her style is soo modern and plain...not my favorite haul /v I love Lauren Conrad and Lucy Hale. my two favorites for makeup/hair/style inspiration. =D /v why is she losing subscribers she is amazing! /v Lol Ingrid if you like Aritzia then you would probably love their annual warehouse sales in Vancouver! /v Yes!!! I am the exact same way about my t shirts!! The sleeves have to be longer and the fit has to be right...it is SO hard to find them haha so thank you for the recommendations, I will have to go get me some!! /v Where did you get the faded black shirt? @IngridNilsen /v Omg I like my t-shirts the same way you described yours! /v Better wear the two floreal pieces not together else they look like a fancy pajama XD /v Everlane has great tshirts! /v Hehe I work at Aritzia :) /v does anyone know what lipstick shes wearing?! /v Hi Ingrid! I really loved your make-up in this video! Could you please teach us? Thanks! /v Eyebrows look funky for some reason...it's either too far apart or too square. My opinion.... /v Ingrid, what is the lipstick you're wearing in the video? I've been trying to find a shade like that for ages and it's been a trial and error kind of thing because, as you pointed out, you can't try drugstore makeup out before buying it so I've been getting these shades and have been really disappointed. Also, is that lipstick you have something you would recommend? /v What camera lens and settings are you using? It looks amazing! /v You should check out a brand called everlane  /v Ingrid!!! I love your shoes! What brand are they?  #havetohave /v Wait I thought she lived in NYC did she move back to LA? /v Omg I recently just got the Wilfred Free tshirt in the nude color too! BEST tshirt ever  /v you are gorgeous without (and with) makeup !! <3 /v FYI that Aritzia thermal stretches out quite a bit so I size down! /v omg I am obsessed with that red sweater!! /v omg please let us know your review on kristin ess products because i've been wanting to try them for a bit /v I love these types of videos! I hope we get an update video soon! /v Love your current hairlength!

I LOVE YOU! <3 /v Awesome! I LOVEEE LUCY HALE, and Lauren Conrad so I'm sooo buying those products by Kristen. I had no idea that was even at target; thankful you mentioned it. \n\nI wear my hair naturally which is pretty much beach waves almost daily. Super excited to try it!  /v Am I the only one sad that aritzia is becoming basic more than outside of Canada /v I love your videos  /v Stop being so cuteeeee i can't handle your cuteness /v Love the black body suit with the zipper and the printed pants! /v target has some really cute fall clothes and shoes right now! xo from my channel to yours <3 /v I love Ingrid but I think it's missing a little floral dress, like that :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syofDm2KhW8 /v Crying because Ingrid looks amazing in this video! /v Will you update us on the hair products once you've used them up a bit? /v High rise, button-fly tapered jeans. Yep, the 90's are definitely baaaaaack!  /v Love the longer hair /v i absolutely love aritzia! for some reason the store on 5th ave in NYC feels quite intimidating though, wishing it was more like the LA store! /v Ingrid are you still focusing on ethical/sustainable fashion? or are you going to revert back to fast fashion? /v Omg you finally look like your old self!!! /v Ingrid, I really think you should read up on Zara and it's production chain. They're truly not a company worth buying and supporting. I hope you look it up! <3 /v Sending love your way  Great video! /v The clothes look cute tbh, but sucks I can't afford it :( /v The jeans look so good /v I NEVER CLICKED ON A VID SO FAST.

But that just strange to me whenever something is going wrong weather wise they always seem to have coverage and they never seem to be affected. /v 9/11 huh ?  not a wierd date  for a  storm  to hit   the US:o /v Pretty exciting, huh?

Girl. Omg. You need a new PR manager. That story got holes. /v Eh... My first kiss sucked too. I was young, dumb and then we got into a huge argument 20 minutes later. XD\nNowadays, I just laugh about it. /v She is such a sweet girl. Even with all her fame and money she seems really humble. I applaud her for donating and changing those kids lives! /v I hope they all die /v this happened a long time ago /v It's so hard, like, being a teenager and running my business makeup lines and reality shows? It's not like you're working in a sweatshop. /v i normally don't pay attention to this family but i have cleft palate and lip so im very happy she did this. /v Love you Kylie you're amazing  /v I can't really hate on her cause she's actually helping people and I'm not lol so i give her props.

They have food, water , shelters, abilities to an extent  . But children in parts of Africa don't even have the necessity s such as water and food and are dying every minute , they are infected with diseases that are life threatening .  But celebrities fund foundations such as animal shelters or disability shelters , when we all know other children in other developing countries in Africa have it worst . Donate to the suffering children of Syria , Iraq , Palestine . All the war torn countries that are invisible to mainstream media . Why praise kylie for filming herself giving charity?  Why boast how good of a person you are . /v 1:07 - 1:21 wow but that was so stupid. Balance being a teenager and run a business. Ppl go to clg and work double shifts to support them and their family. Wow. Srsly  wow. I pity her.\nBut at least she's giving back something. /v People are going to always judge and hate no matter what you do... /v First /v For once I will say ..

Love ya babe! /v I don't want to live on this planet anymore /v I commend her for donating to kids with cleft palates and helping make their lives better, but it feels counterproductive putting it on her show for views, which just earns her more money. Is it really a thoughtful gesture, or is it all just for money? /v Amen  /v she is killing the game, somehow she hasn't replied back to our podcast request though lol /v I only watch for the comments \n\n\n\nIs that bad? haha /v Very sweet of her  /v The stupidity of this offends me. /v Now we see why she got her lips done that's a bummer /v still people keep hatin on them coz they say these kardashians and jenners doing nothin. lol stfu this video speaks a lot mate /v I knew that I was doomed. Lol. /v This show is legit all abt her selfie /v now to take onpoverty, misery, hopelessness, pain, and sufferingworldwide! /v Kris Jenner is so fake person /v Morons give birth to more morons. /v Ridicula /v Como assim as pessoas tao criticando a roupa dela inves de ver oq ela ta fzndo kk krl de internet pessoas do krl /v all for ratings!!!!!!!!!!!! /v I have derealization all the time as well and it is so comforting to know I'm not the only one thank you. /v YAY KATI!!!! I can't believe you two collabed!!! This made me so happy when I saw this video in my sub box /v Awwe I'm so proud of Dodie. She has learned to talk about mental health without over sharing. /v I have derealization and depersonalization and it's really hard but your videos help me. /v Really enjoyed watching this video. I don't have depersonalisation or anything but hearing kati talk about some of those things were so interesting and make me really want to study psychology. I went through and read to comments and so many people are saying they're struggling. I know this won't help or do anything but I'm so sorry you're having a hard time <3 I hope you get the help you need and I do believe that everything will turn out okay <3 xxx /v I think beginning to try and get out of your state ( whatever your problem is, wether it's depersonalisation/realisation or anxiety ) is the first step and maybe hardest, for some people, towards healing... /v loved the description of the childhood little Ts as i've never really thought about it in that way before! /v I have the same glasses, but in pink :)) /v holy shit. I think i have derealization. i always feel like i'm not actually 'there' like it was all a dream. i thought it wasn't a mental illness i always thought that it's just me being weird? but i didn't have any traumatic past though. i'm really scared. /v thank you. i really needed to hear this today, knowing that im not alone and that what i feel is valid <3 /v This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe  /v When I get really depressed I don't recognise myself. Like I'll know I'm the one moving my body but it doesn't feel like me and when I look into a mirror I know it's my face because I know I'm looking into a mirror but I don't recognise it.\nThe longest that it has happened for one time was about a week\n\n*edit* When you were talking about small childhood issues that weren't that big but seemed worse at the time. At one stage the back of my hands were hit with a wooden spoon until my knuckels were bleeding, things like that still dont seem like a small issue /v I finally know what to call this feeling;;; /v this was super interesting to hear about, my knowledge of mental illnesses was super limited up until recently and i find learning new things like this, thought it is sad its kinda at your expense... /v I'm really reluctant to say that anything's wrong with me given that I'm so young, I've never had anything traumatic happen to me and I generally have a good memory, but I looked up a list of dissociation symptoms on a very reliable health website and I related to 8 out of 10 of them. /v Katiiii! I love this woman. Her videos saved my life, particularly her video on intrusive thoughts. I have severe OCD and I had a random spike in 2015 and I was very close to ending my life when I came across Kati's videos. If you're reading this Kati I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.  /v i don't know why i'm crying halfway through but thank you for this. <3 /v So informative and helpful thanks lovely girls x /v As someone who also suffers from derealisation and depersonalisation and is constantly told by therapists, I don't know what's wrong with you, or I don't know how to help you, this video was endlessly helpful for me. Thank you  /v When I got trama last year in my freshmen year and my way to cope was talking to myself which then turned into a imaginary friend. This friend then began becoming abusive (since they were my own thoughts) and kept me up at night. I haven't talked about it with anyone cause I'm 15 and I feel like they'll think I've gone mad... /v I'm always so confused how you can like test if you have depersonalisation or derealisation because how can I know that I feel spaced out? Like sometimes I feel like in a dream but then I'm like: ah no it's real and that's it idk it's weird /v This is super interesting and it actually helped me understand a few things about myself. /v I've had derealisation since I was really young but I never knew what was really happening. Lately I've just started to think it was something related to my anxiety. Thank you so much for making this video and explaining all of this it really helped. /v This was so interesting! /v Even if I don't have derealisation or depersonalisation I have that kind of thoughts sometimes and I had anxiety and depression all this year and all your videos helped me so much. You talking about all this things makes me feel good because I found someone who knows what I went through all this months because even though there are a lot about mental illness in pages, there are not many people who actually suffers it and talks openly about it. Thank you so much Dodie. I know you're going to get out of this and that you're going to be able to feel yourself again. /v This comforted me I haven't recover since something that happened 2 years ago and to bring my brain back too!  \nI get headaches and anxiety too! And I fiddle so much and fidgeting since recovering from my trauma but I also might have ADHD too and still have derealisation too but I'm not diagonised but I know I have been going through depersonalisation for 2 years /v Thank you so much for this video! It was really helpful to me and interesting to me, thank you thank you  /v Great video, this is super interesting! I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\n\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term. Not excepting all the answers from youtube comments but still  /v Hi\nI don't really know why I'm doing this but I guess it's a way to say something and not have anyone knows it's me.Im so sorry if your reading this,this is prosbly gonna suck.So,I'm relatively young(still in high school) and I think (I thiinnkkk) I may need help.Like I need to get medication or go to a therapist and I know I know something is wrong I can feel it in my brain but my mum hasn't noticed anything so I guess in my head it means it can't be that bad.This is getting ridiculously long and I'm sorry but I just wanna scream what's the point of being here any more god damn it /v This helped a lot for me to understand what I'm told I have when ever a panic attack it's going to happen which I guess is a good thing in away because I know when I need to take myself out of something so yeah thanks  /v every time you talk about this, i feel a little less crazy because no one in my personal life understands it at all. it makes me feel like it's more real and like i'm not making it up. thank you! x /v im not sure what im going through. its not good to self diagnose but i feel like i may have dissociation or derealization. i feel very spaced out and hopeless in certain situations regarding relationships and being interested in getting closer to someone (or sometimes just in general). i become very tired and want to cry, and i have no clue whats going on around me. my hands begin to doodle random things on my classwork and i dont understand what ive just learned when my lesson is over. i hear everything and do my work but i also dont have any clue of what im working on. i feel like sometimes i will doodle on my paper while not even looking at it and but i can see what im drawing. i very often draw eyes when i feel this way. they are always crying or rolling into the back of the head. im not sure what im feeling but if you could help me find out i would greatly appreciate it. - x mirae /v dodie, i'm not exactly sure what i hope to gain out of writing you this message, as i'm sure you get tons of messages like this daily. i suppose its more so for me than for you, but i really want you to know what an impact you have had on me. i have been struggling with depersonalization/derealization since i was little, but recently after a car accident was launched into it basically 24/7 for a couple of months now. its truly the scariest thing i've ever had to deal with, and there have been so many times when i have felt so completely alone and ready to give up. just seeing that you also struggle with this and that you still manage to do so much and reach so many people, honestly that keeps me going sometimes. this disorder is truly one of the most devastating things in my opinion, but you are such a bright light. so thank you, for this and for being you  /v When I have panic attacks I can't feel anything, last time my friend was hugging me and I didn't know until she told me. It also feels like you've lost your sight? Because you're so out of it it's almost like you can't see in away and you're memory goes away, I don't know but that's what I have /v I don't know if this is exactly what I struggle with, but it seems to be a close match. I do often feel as if everything is a dream and I can't process what real life means, I also struggle with brain fog, which for me feels like pressing up against a window (seeing) and not being able to look behind you, so everything you need you have to put your arms behind you and feel for (thinking) and the bit where you remove yourself from the situation is the worst. it's somewhere between turning yourself into data and having a video game glitch and you're underneath the character and the graphics are wonky. this is such a weird description, but anyways, I'm going to look into it. /v I've been dealing with dissociation and depersonalisation disorder for over a year now. I was scared to watch this video, because Dodie has always been my escape from everything. The world is so unfair for making her feel the same things and struggling with this condition the same way I and many people do. This video was very informative and super accurate, good job girls  I still felt hopeless after watching this, like I always do when it comes to dissociation. I just feel like there is no cure for this. Nothing ever works. I feel like I will never feel alive again and I will never get back the contact to myself that I once lost. I don't know who I am, I only know who I once was. But that person in the past is not me anymore. I just wish everything would end and I found myself again. It will be over, but I'll always be asking when? /v how i finally understand the line in the twenty one pilots song holding on to you. left side brain, the part of your brain that depression festers. /v this was so helpful, thank you so much <33 /v Idek what's wrong with me if can't even form the words to make out what was wrong with me. It could be depression but I know for a fact I have anxiety I just don't know how severe. I went to go talk to a psychologist, but I don't know how to be verbal about my issues bc idk what's wrong. I am soooo confused with how I feel and my parents won't take me to a psychiatrist bc they don't want me on meds. Bc they think that they won't help bc my mom said she took them when she was a child and they made her feel disconnected from the world. But it affects everyone differently. But they don't understand. My mom says it's part of being a teenager and it's all in my head. And idk what to do. Omg I didn't think it was normal to feel this way when you're a teenager but my mom seems to have all the answers. And it drive me fucking mad. Bc I can't talk to anyone bc I can't explain what I feel. And jeez. Does anyone have any advice. I'm probably just rambling. My mind feels like mush like its in a haze of some sort. Idk pls help me someone.  /v Dodie, thank you so much for making this video!! I could relate to a few things and you really helped me out. I also had EMDR and it really helped me! :) /v I don't have depersonalisation but every now and then I can have a Trippy/ strange situation where I look at my hands and they don't feel like me. I say my name over and over in my head and I think 'who is that ' like how is my identity a name ? Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this ? /v I don't have derealisation but I have anxiety and I sometimes get spaced out randomly. For example, I will be sitting in class and I will zone out just randomly and the same question pops in my head, what if reality is a dream? I feel like I'm dreaming! \n\nIt's very odd. If you have this please could you give me some wise advice because I am very confused lol thanks! Also Dodie I hope you get better soon with your therapy help! I'm not going to give you my pity because I think that that's the worst thing someone can do when your going through something. You kind of just want them to go away Thank you for sharing this video with us! It sure helped me and hopefully a lot of other people! I love you Dodie! x /v Dodie!!! Thank you and Kati so so much for this!!! I have derealization mostly in chunks of time and usually it's when I'm stressed, and this explained so much :) Thanks so much for explaining about the trauma--I didn't know about that! I think too many things were happening so my brain just spaced out. For some reason, before this, I assumed it was brain chemistry but trauma makes sense! I really hope you get better soon :) and I hope I can work through this too <3 /v so should i fake feelings when im  disconnected? /v I also have depersonalisation and derealisation, that's linked to my anxiety and things from my past. This was so helpful, especially to know that I'm not alone. My derealisation makes me panic so much and usually happens in social situations. It's so disorientating that I just have to leave the situation and go home a lot of the time. /v i was just wondering as somebody who doesnt have depersonalisation do you find that music or like playing ukulele helps to focus/ground you? /v This is amazing. I truly understand and also deal with this. Dissociation is so hard and scary. /v Hi! I have a question/need advice:\nI took a math test yesterday and as I started getting more stressed because of time, I could feel myself getting more and more sucked away. After I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna finish it, I decided to do the easy ones on the back, but I couldn't even remember how to do a simple factoring problem. My mind wasn't there at all. I was wondering how to fix this/bring my mind back when this happens? When it does come back after I get out of that situation, panic attacks come on because everything rushes at me at once. Any ways to bring my mind back to focus WHILE it happens, then not get flooded afterwards? /v I experience derealization because of a major traumatic experience and sometimes it gets so bad where I become basically unresponsive because I'm just so spaced out and it leads to people getting angry at me because I don't respond to them and when I'm so spaced out it can be scary when someone is yelling at me while I feel like nothing is real. /v OHHH MY GOD I LOVE THISSO MUCH I LOVE KATY SO MUCH AND I LOVE DODIE SO EFFING MUCH ARGHA /v Wow! I didn't know that was a thing! I don't deal with it anymore but for a while when I spoke I didn't recognize my own voice it was very alarming and very uncomfortable. Glad to know there is a term for that if it ever sparks up again /v Ok idk if this is anything but whenever I'm in a happy experience I feel like I'm not taking it in idkis that normal /v i'm soo happy you made this video because i could never properly explain what it was to my family and friends!! i've had it for over a year now, but overtime it's become less of a problem because i learned to cope with it although at times it does get bad.. /v guys if u ever need to talk my sc is: sunkophunkie. tell me if ur adding me. i have been through a lot and still am /v Are there more people that tried emdr but couldnt think back to the memories, because they were to much or something like that?\nI had that and i feel like it wouldve helped so much if i just dared to think back /v I have issues with derealisation and depersonalisation every single day and this video was so damn nice and well put together. I think I'm going to show it to my boyfriend so he can understand more about what I'm dealing with and how just telling me to stop isn't gonna make me feel okay and that I'm not just being sad or whatever and me acting like I don't care anymore isn't because of him, it's just because I feel like nothing is real and I feel disconnected from myself. Hopefully this will help him understand more, if any of you have any advice please let me know  /v I love Kati so much! thank you for this video! /v Look at me I have problems -this girl tries to hard to look like she has issues /v Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening. I'm fine now so don't worry, I'm just curious if that's what it was as I'm trying to learn more about mental health illnesses so I can be more helpful to friends who might go through these thing. /v i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x /v Hey, I wanted to share my story if anyone is listening so uhm yeah if you want to read it you can, I just wanted to since I've never talked about it before\n\n\nSo since I was born my mother has had depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social. I'm scared I'm going to develop Asperges, a genetic mental disorder my mum carries. My uncle has it and because of it I've never met him, same with my grandma. Sorry if this is a little weird, but it feels good to let it out. /v It's strange because I've just had a day of feeling spaced out but I feel so much more connected to myself now I'm watching this video, maybe because I relate? Or because it's helping mefeel lessalone x /v I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING /v I love this. I love Kati, she was so understanding i loved everything about this. so calming. thank you /v I'm not gonna say I have this stuff, but I tend to have episodes where everything feels like a dream and very distant. For a while I would have small moments of depersonalization, and during school years, I would have up to almost a month at a time or at least most of a week I will/would just have empty busy times. In those times I just go through life without thinking and barely remember what happens when I come out of it. I get really touchy a lot and I have a friend who used to physically latch onto people and when she did that to me, I got stressed and had that distant feeling and that feeling usually meant in a few days I would have those empty periods of time.\nI don't know, though. Just don't attack me, because I'm only saying I have similar experiences and am very paranoid and idk why, but I'm not going to diagnose myself. /v Can you have the text stay up for a bit longer on your videos please? I've noticed a few youtubers recently started making text come and go quite quickly and it's not always possible to pause the video fast enough to read the text . Especially important for something that is giving context and Wil make it more accessible to people. Thanks! /v Okay this really helped me sort of understand why I feel detached from the world at times. I've been in a car crash and ever since it's scarred me & stuck with me for the past 8 years. My friends think I'm being dramatic but even I know I'm not being dramatic because I know it was sourced from somewhere. Thank you, Dodie  /v When I watched your last video I didn't really see myself with the things you were talking about, but this one where she was talking about the many little T's adding up it really hit me. also how you were talking about how touch can ground you, I've never really thought that was at all related to me not feeling alive or awake or real, but i guess it is now. I'm defiantly not self diagnosing but I think I relate with a lot of this.   \nI was wondering if it's possible to have more of a less severe case of derealization /v omg doddie trendin /v :') /v yeahhh sertraline sucked for me too rip /v Shiny! /v Thanks for this fantastic video! During my worst stages of anxiety I experienced depersonalisation and derealisation for 3 months straight. Luckily through coping techniques and talking through my trauma I overcame it and haven't felt this way in years. You got this Dodie!  /v Hi Dodie! \n\nLet me first say that I love your music and your videos! They make my day better :)\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that I'm a 20 year old Music Education student and I was wondering if music therapy could be an option that you've considered for derealization/depersonalization. I'm not a doctor, but I do strongly believe in the results that music therapy can bring. I'd like to maybe know your thoughts about it too :) Does Britain have any programs like this (I'm from Canada and I do know it's becoming more popular here)? Could this be another helpful thing for people with this disorder?\n\nI don't want to seem bossy or anything; I'm just curious about what you think and I'd like to help in any way that I can haha. \n\nKeep making videos Dodie and keep being an inspiration because you are doing amazing things :) Thanks :) /v thank you dodie for uploading this video. I understand more about derealisation and know there are other mental diseases out in the world noticed. Maybe I do have something or maybe I don't. Overall, you made my eyes open and make me feel real for just at least some minutes. /v I feel like I have dissociation, but it's not during moments of stress or trauma. It's mainly brought on by being awake in the middle of the night. Could being awake really late cause a trigger in my brain? /v Thank god ive found the name for this. I'm already feeling a lot better. /v I posted a comment on here before, but the question just occurred to me. Has anyone down here in the comments gone through dp/dr and came out of it?  Best of luck to you Dodie. I'm actually in the UK now and it'd be amazing to meet someone else that's experiencing the same thing. Best of luck to you<33 /v I usually don't comment on this type of stuff, I doubt anyone will even read this but I don't know what's wrong with me. Everything feels like a dream. It doesnt feel real. I don't really have past traumatic events. I don't know why nothing feels real or why I get sad and tired all the time. I make myself busy doing stuff to try to distract myself and it doesn't work a whole lot. For some reason I feel not as sad currently and it changes from extremely sad to almost okay. When I'm upset I can't imagine what it was like to be happy. I write stuff when I'm sad and when I'm happy I'll read it and be like how did I ever feel this the main thing that messes me up is time. Stuff is over too fast and time just feels very weird /v wow I've had derealization and depersonalization and I didn't know what was wrong but this helped me out so so much. I just didn't feel like I was there and I didn't feel like I was my self. I have more memories with my derealization because it used to happen A LOT. I never knew what was wrong. During those episodes I don't like talking to anyone because it makes me feel more out of myself. Thank you soooo much /v This video made me realize that I have had moments of derealization and depersonalization in the past. Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel! Thank you so much for making this video, it helped me a lot! \nLots of love! /v my? two? favorite? people? in? one? video???? I'm shook , I lo ve y a l l  /v i'm not sure i have dissociation/depersonalization/derealisation? idk, i have long periods where my brain feels disconnected from my body... kinda like,, floating in the space above my head? weird concept i know,, and i don't feel like i have any emotion and every feeling- physical or emotion- is like dulled at the edges and sometimes lights can seem too bright and everything i hear seems like white noise. i don't really have trauma tho so idkkkk i feel like i'm being dramatic and unnecessary /v The bit about the marbles was SO INTERESTING AND EYE-OPENING I never thought of trauma that way. I treated it as a single marble I wouldn't stop picking up instead of something that's been shattered/dispersed through everything. /v tbh the inside out analogy made a lot of sense /v okay i need help. sometimes i get a feeling that sort of sounds like this but i dont know if it is or not. for example the other night i was in the backseat of my friends' car on the way home from a movie and idk why but she started tickling me as a joke and we were laughing and i was squirming and as i bent over to hide my face from her, i just felt this really weird wave of disconnection. like i was floating outside of my body, and i couldnt feel myself smiling or smell anything and all the sounds around me went hazy, like i was under water. it happened again twice that night when i was just sitting there in the car, not even laughing and moving around anymore. its happened more times for sure but that was the most recent. is this something to look into? /v I zone out when I'm stressed and start to be quiet and sometimes I do it in class and it scares my teacher  ;-; and I todally feel like I'm not here or like life is just a dream when it happens /v that was so educating and well illustrated, i love it!! /v I think I might have derealization, but like you when it's at its worst depersonalization. Honestly to me it's really terrifying. I don't fell like I'm here and that I'm in a dream. I really wish I could talk to a parent but they'd think I'm just going through a phase or being over dramatic. I really wish I could figure out what's wrong with me... \nBut I just wanted to say thank you so much dodie. Thanks to you, I figured some things out and why I'm feeling like this. Not everything of course, there's still a lot I don't know. But videos like these really help  ilysm /v Schema therapy is amazing! I have tried a bunch of meds, general talk therapy, CBT, TMS, a bunch of things in an intensive outpatient program, and they helped but none as much as schema therapy. /v I have no memory of my childhood, my brain repressed every memory because of a really big trauma that happened to me when I was 5 /v This was wonderful 'cause I learned so much! Thank you Dodie and Kati! /v To me, looking in a mirror is a scarrest part of depersonalisation because you start to realize so well that something is wrong. Luckily I haven't experienced this for a long time like now it happens only when I'm extra tired and sad, it feels like your body tries to protect you /v I cannot tell you enough how much this type of videos helped me! Really, really from the bottom of my heart thank you. /v when i was younger i used to feel like i was trapped in my body and that my hands weren't my part of my body and now i'm just realizing i am mentally ill /v iz mah burthdae todaeee yaeeeeeeeeeee /v OMG... I think I may have this... I go into this state of mind where it's feels like I'm dreaming and it's hard to control my body and what's going on... and I start to panic before and after it happenes... I have never heard of this and I thought it was just me... but like everyone thinks I'm crazy when I tell them /v Can someone help me figure out whats wrong with me?? I have a constant state of feeling like I'm forgetting to do something (when I'm not), or that I should be doing something else. I'm often not content with anything I'm doing or feel uncomfortable with things i accomplish. Sometimes I feel better about it and other times it spikes, often after I go out to have fun or a major important event happens in my life.

When Jesus comes back to take up his bride and punish the UNREPENTANT Sinners of this Earth.

(His name was JESUS!!!)......\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on the reason why people want to stay in their sins and not accept him as their Lord and savior and as believers, you have to produce works to show that you have saving faith in God. (Matthew 3:8)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.):\n\nAnd this is the condemnation,\nthat light is come into the world,\nand men loved darkness rather than light,\nbecause their deeds were evil.\n\n(Condemnation): Refers to the reason for judgment. The light referred to here is Jesus, the light of the world).\n\nFor every one that doeth evil \nhateth the light,\nneither cometh to the light, \nlest his deeds should be exposed.\n\n(People offer many excuses for not accepting Christ. Some cite the presence of hypocrites in the church. Others claim inability to believe some of the truths about Christ or the gospel. These are merely attempts to conceal a heart in rebellion against God. The ultimate reason people do not come to Christ is that they do not want to).\n\nBut he that doeth truth \ncometh to the light, \nthat his deeds may be made manifest, \nthat they are done in God.\n\n(The one who does the truth, (1 John 1:5)<---This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all), is obviously, already a believer because his or her deeds are done in God. Therefore, coming to the light is more than exercising faith. A person who comes to the light not only believes, but also openly identifies with the light so that his or her works can be seen as things done in union with God. (Jame 2:14)<---What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? (James 2:24)<---Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. (James 2:26)<---For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also).\n\n(John 3:19-21). /v Subscribe to my channel /v To be ready for God's arrival.

It looked really great in the beginning but obviously oxidized to be WAYYYY to dark by the end of the video. In front of all of my studio lights I couldn't tell but it's very obvious on camera. I love the foundation but will definitely be picking up a lighter shade! /v Wait ur back on YouTube ??? What happened to that big dramatic video u made about YouTube not being fun anymore. Or was that just u being dramatic and attention ? Ugh!!! Let me guess u were like how I'm I going to make money. lol girl bye !!! /v you guys do realize that he's wearing an orange sweatshirt which reflects orange onto his face which makes it look more orange than it really is. fucking idiots.  /v I tested trophy wife in store and like he said its really glittery and not as glowing and I think its really nice but I LOVE a glow, glitter isn't my fav /v you said it yourself later in the video- the sponge absorbs most of the product. that's why it took so much foundation- not because of the foundation but because of the sponge. it's also a light to medium coverage foundation, not supposed to be full coverage. /v Who the hell is uses 20 pumps of foundation...I can't deal with any more than two pumps /v I love when he says hi sisters  /v If Jeffree Star doesn't think Trophy Wife is too dark than neither should you. You just applied way too much, didn't look bad at first. /v can everyone fuck off about how fast he talks ? like dern slow the speed down or sum. /v Can I recommend to maybe wear neutral toned clothing (next time) so it doesn't reflect onto your face from the bright lights?  I feel that that's mostly causing the orange face problem. /v yall needa stop being so rude jesus fucking christ. he got the wrong shade. chill. go fucking donate or do some good shit in the world than be a bitch online /v I don't find anything wrong with your review don't understand why people got upset. Thanks for the review /v Hey hey! \nI liked your review and you were honest about your opinion. Not everyone will like everything and that's okay. The foundation is great but it not only matches skin tone but the undertone as well and the one you picked up is a bit warm and you might be on the cooler/pink side. I don't like Sephora's lighting and they have done me in from time to time as well. /v I feel bad for him :/ if u don't like him then just leave it's not that hard /v EVERYONE HAS SAID IT OXIDIZES.... JUST BC THE BRAND TOLD YOU IT DON'T DOESN'T MAKE IT THE ACTUAL TRUTH!!!! IT OXIDIZES A SHADE DARKER!!!! SO BE CAREFUL /v So, you're doing a review with no knowledge about the products?? /v I think he applied alot of contour that's why he looks orange. /v Thank you so much for showing the darkest foundation color on your black friend. My nieces are half Jamaican and I've been having a hard time finding makeup lines that carry their shade. You're the only YouTuber that I've seen so far do this. It's great bc you've helped me and my nieces; so I'd like to say thank you. /v Was so surprised to see Tati!!!  /v Your sister thing takes me back to my childhood Mormon days  /v No hate, but you obviously didn't buy it! You got it sent to you. Just saying! /v WERENT YOU GOING TO QUIT YOUTUBE? YOU SHOULD HAD STUCK TO THAT PLAN DONE US ALL A FAV. YOUR DONE!!!! /v Keep doing you babe, I thought this was a super fair review and it's honestly pathetic that people want to find any reason to hate on you  Much love x /v Damn James you talked sooo fucking fast in this video  /v i love you sister! /v You speak faster than my ex c*ming /v To me, you still did a good job.  /v Can't wait to try the foundation and primer out now! Although I think I'll have to take a bit of time picking out the right colour of foundation or one closest to my skin tone!! Love you videos!!  /v Hate him, he talks to god damned fast.. /v his flashback test picture looks like a animated character  why must you be so perfect /v People don't have to love the brand just because it's Rihanna's if it's shitty it's shitty no matter who created t /v You talk so fast /v <3 So much love sister! Thank you! /v It's not vine , it's youtube\n\nTake your time and stop (talking fast ) /v The foundation applied that way because u didn't use the brush that was made to apply it. And translucent powder is white like every other. U put so much foundation on....of course the other stuff isn't gonna blend correctly. I kinda feel like u are being bIas cuz u seemed a lol shooketh that u weren't invited to the event. But other than that...u talk quite fast /v I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized; assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus ; yet don't know that hooded eyes can't have the same cat eye wing angle as almond shape eyes. Or something as simple as foundation . Unless you are certified in the field or know the chemistry behind it, please don't deem a product horrible if it doesn't work for you .Also if a product does work for you , doesn't mean the person who had a harder time with it doesn't know what they are doing . Simply means it's not for them . \n       Sincerely a makeup enthusiast. /v Hey James I just want to say I thought your review was really good. /v you need to start breath /v What is it that your closing yor eyes that much ? /v Thanks for the honesty James! I don't want someone recommending something to be because they like Rihanna. I want to know what fucking works and what doesn't ! /v the most iconic sister /v Wow I've watched so many reviews and my number 1 take away from the collection is that oxidization is HUGE I will be going 1 shade lighter. /v Why do you talk with your eyes closed and sound like you have a mouth full of jizz The hand motions and erratic head movements are so distracting. Also why are your nails done! I'm all for guys doing makeup but I just think it's creepy when I see dudes that have a dick and two balls wearing acrylic nails. Oh and stay off the Adderall pills please! /v Am I the only one who prefers the Fenty beauty blender? It gives a more natural look he looked just fine with it. Using a lot of make-up only makes you look like a chalk board. /v get those damn lenses out of your head ffs ,cant even blink properly,gives me anxiety /v I'm confused why you purchased the shades that don't match just to show your viewers. couldn't you have just taken a photo of it on the back of your hand in store?... /v Charles you teach me one thing: be careful what comes out my mouth because your one wrongful act on this social media platform will haunt you to your grave. Everyone even your own will look at you side way. To be honest, I think he was giving a honest review. Just slow down abit when speaking... it takes practice but slower enough to capture the audience when doing product reviews. /v Omg I was thinking yay I have found a new person to subscribe too but if you talk this fast in your videos, ummm yeah I don't think so any more sorry you are so pretty though xx /v You talk to really fast lol /v Does he get tired talking in that voice? /v omg I can't believe how fast James talks. omg /v This bottom is crazy looking like if peewee Herman shited out a human or the puppets on his show /v Why did everyone have a problem with this review, it amazing, ppl need to stop making shit up out of nothing. /v Yall are so immature if y'all don't like him then don't watch his videos /v Kinda like the eye look but he looks like his sweater /v Is he/she a boy a girl? /v any small youtubers want to support each other subscribe and i'll follow back :) /v the only reason why it wasnt full coverage is because the sponge was damp which the Rhianna said herself not to do while blending contour and foundation /v He is so annoying he sounds like a 15 year old girl /v your eyes are closed more often than they're open. /v y you talk like ur toounge tooo big for your mouth fam /v The foundation is way too dark for the majority of the people I've watched. Crazyyyyy /v hey! i love watching your videos and your makeup always looks dope but foundation color is always just a bit too dark. try going a shade lighter! trust me, i been through it too /v are his eyes ok /v This line is meant to give u a natural makeup look /v Well it did say..for full coverage to build it on:) so I think it's good!!! But for people like  you who use a lot of foundation maybe not your fav. /v The foundation looks so natural /v you look so unreal in that foundation /v James's artistry has really improved. He's always been an amazing artist with loads of talent, but the growth is definitely there!  /v He ALWAYS looks like he is reading a script. /v I don't think the orange sweater was a good idea either /v Oh wow you talk really fast. Lucky for you I'm Mexican so my tas talk 100 mph as well /v I noticed that your eyes are closed most of the time.... /v I feel like James was the only one who was being honest with his review.

Even though it's rather difficult to use, I found it rather interesting. I really liked mixing the iodine with water in the measuring tube and expecting a reaction. The premade slides were useful and fun to look at (when I could get the Microscope set up just right). I think the most important thing I learned was that diluted iodine and those shrimp did not taste good at all. I just think it's funny because I enjoyed it as a kid. In fact, I still have that kit in my closet... or what's left of it. /v that thing with the points on it is for people that fidget allot /v Samantha is so pretty, also with that vest mathias look like one of those movie grandpas /v I'm not even kidding my cousin has this except it actually moves.

Dead phone, no working stove, no lights, hot as hell, and loud fucking noises coming from outside. Then when my dad came home from the school shelter the electricity immediately came on He was gone for 2 days! I was so happy I almost cried. /v Got to applaud the media for constantly giving updates and warnings. /v who would win in a fight Irma or 9/11 lmao /v The wind speeds are always higher on the news. /v This has like no views but yet is trending... /v NIGGER IS JUST A WORD. /v 0:27 You must be batshit crazy accept that job. /v EVERYONE COME SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL, PLEASE I NEED 100,000 subscribers.!!!!! /v 1:18 guy stuck in the tree /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Fishing will be great /v why is this trending at 24k? /v I KNOW there was some damage but NOTHING like the media built this storm  up to be the WORSE EVER!!

Or if you're not a big fan of reason or science, just listen to Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones, do nothing, and drown.  But the rest of us don't want to pay any more federal subsidies for your reality denying arses to rebuild in areas that get flooded every two years. /v I live in Florida my intenet is shit im in my house but its baricated with iron stuff idl what its called...i am terrified well idk if i will die or no #PrayForFlorida /v What the hell do you mean punch in the face? /v Lookie, lookie!

You're fucking retards!!!!!! /v ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Florida that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2eQvIgZ /v But... what if you needed to open it on while stuck on an incline? /v and thats my boring video of the day\n\n#42 on trending, grats /v it's for when you accelerate....so shit doesn't shoot out the door. all that fwd Honda civic G force you get on the launch /v Thats actually a really cool little feature. If you had something with some weight in there, like a phone, a sock full of coins, or a lead pig. They'd probably overcome the spring-loaded door and slide out under heavy acceleration (especially up a hill).\nCheers for sharing your find, man. /v This is for when the car accelerates. Have you ever had something on your dash and started out real fast, everything gets dumped on the floor. This weight when the car accelerates quickly will cause the door to be held shut preventing everything inside from coming out. /v What an utterly pointless video. This deserved some recognition? /v It's for when you have something with a bit of weight to it stored in there (mobile phone, etc), so it wont come flying out on steep hills, accelerating, etc. /v Then you park on a hill and realise you cant get your smokes out... /v Jesus H. Christ in heaven above fuck me in the ass. Why are there so many negative comments about shaking and dropping? I didn't have a single problem with the video and thought it was very interesting. Shut the fuck up! /v LMFAO... and when you stick your cigarettes and wallet in that box then park on a hill...LOL  yes this did happen. 1995 Rodeo.  I removed the door FOREVER... /v K WE GOT IT IN 20 SC. NO NEED TO GO ON. /v That was actually brilliant. /v Hey genius, it's to prevent stuff from flying out when you ACCELERATE.\n\nYou really think they would put a locking mechanism for when the car is tilted backwards?? /v 700 people cannot hide their drugs in there anymore. /v Can't fit your hand in there because it is made to hold CD cases, not 'stuff'.  Don't you hate when the quarter you just really need is sitting back there and you can't get it out? [Insert dropping and smashing sounds here...] /v i wish they would have done somthing like this mirrior under the sun visor. the dam lid would fall down. eventually got pissed amd ripped it off ass a cop was parked next to me. /v Just think of the engineer, or team there of, that is soaking up a free paycheck to overthink simple problems. Why simply use a stronger spring that holds the door closed when you can spend hours making a stupid fail safe for a junk compartment! /v There's a similar feature on tripods that will hook your camera from falling off... It also prevents shakes and rattling. /v and if you park uphill you can't  access whats inside?! /v I Jared,\nMy name is Johanna and I work for a video production company called StoYo Media. We would like to publish video in a story. Of course we would mention you as owner of the content and make your name visible in the video. \nMany thanks\nJohanna /v this would have been a good video except your camera work. Please put your phone on a tripod next time you want to make a boring video of the day.\nShaky video is worse than Portrait video /v Here's to engineers /v You're a nerd. /v the guy holding a camera acts like retard, so annoying /v So if the cars upside down....it shuts the box? /v I'll bet it's super annoying to have it lock up in San Francisco. /v When going up a hill, that locks the door and stops anything that may slide inside from sliding out and flying across the car. So in essence, that is a time saver, because it saves you the time you'd have taken to clean that mess up. /v If you are getting towed the guy can't steal your spare credit cards and cash etc.... /v People in San Fran be like duh. /v Could you stop hitting the thing on the table. I don't know if it's on purpose but man is it annoying. /v Ok this is cool but what's the code for my fuckin radio?  It just decided I need a code so now no music. /v STOP moving the camera around so much, you idiot fuckstick. /v Are you really this stupid? /v 552k views. Not even 200 subscribers. What /v It's on the Suburu Baja as well....actually, it's probably on all Suburus /v For when dat vtech kick in yo \n\nDon't want homie dawgs weed flyin bout da car when u takes off real fast out da KFC drive tru in the civic u n yo boys just stolt from da white mans down da street. /v One of the many tiny things the engineers came up with that was kept in the design! /v Shit, now I gotta go to my car. /v How many times can he drop it shake and drop it again, I thought he was showing a video on how durable it was. /v It's the little things in life  /v OMG stop slamming SH!T on the table! /v You should notice a small, useful device called a tripod. /v It's probably a part of the safety features for accidents. Whatever is in the compartment during a crash would overcome the spring loaded door and become a lethal projectile. The weight would lock the door during an impact. Just a guess /v When your laptop is worth more than your car /v It so when you have heavy stuff in it and you floor it, the thing doesn't dump all your crap out. Not for hills. It's a honda, not a Jeep genius. /v When your boring video of the get becomes trending /v Wow, worst camera work ever. I've know squirrels with near fatal meth addictions that had a steadier hand with the camera. This was impossible to watch after about 7 seconds in. /v That's so rice /v That must be a feature to stop a-holes from fumbling through all their crap while driving. It probably locks when the car hits a certain speed too not just uphill. /v It doesn't keep the door from opening on its own. It keeps YOU from opening the door. Certainly not a feature I'd like to discover when I really need to get into the cubby. /v Japanese engineering. The best in the world /v Alternate title is ape manhandles car part. /v Jared, Roger here saying hello! Aka Klasse Act aka The Striped SVT. John S sent me your vid here, hope all is going well with you....subscribed! /v Wow genius, how about we take a look at the rest of the car where there's 100 things that are much more impressive. /v Its to keep it from flying open in a rearend collision. Good try though. /v This guy hit the jackpot. Only had 120 subs, is on trending and gets 466k views /v Maybe has something to do with the door opening slowly and smoothly? :/ /v So fucking what? If it was constantly flying open everytime you drove uphill, it would be a major design flaw. Is this a video to amaze retards or something? /v Lmao he's not a professional YouTuber!  Y'all watching Casey neistat and expecting everyone to give a shit about video quality! He's just a nice man who was trying to share something cool! Keep bein groovy Jared! /v be me, own POS 2003 CIVIC hand-me-down. Always have to park on uphill slope when I get home from minimum wage job....can't open goddamn storage unit if I'm not level, so needless to say I often have to leave valuables behind until the next day to retrieve.   One day I leave my prized anime cards behind after forgetting to open latch during a level straight away.  Park near studio apartment.  Storage unit is rendered useless.   Cards are in the car overnight.   That night there is a BLM protest on my block.  Car gets set ablaze.  Cards are gone forever.   \nGet on youtubes to find solace, comfort and maybe some seductively soothing ASMR.....instead find a fidgety dork honoring the Honda engineers for this this blatant quality control oversight.   \nDecide to take pills and wait for the sweet release of death.  This will be my final post.   RIP in peace, me. /v Everyone in the comment section needs to chill. He's holding a large, clunky object with his non dominant hand so he can hold the camera. So what if he's a little clumsy. /v I'd find that really frustrating if I lived on a hill and that damn lock kept making getting my stuff out after I parked difficult to get out. /v Who else is watching this after reading the Mashable tweet ? /v pick it up and throw it around five hhundred more times /v but what if you park on a hill and need to get something out of there? /v Check put my channel for some cool car videos :) /v Wow mind blown wow I'm going to put one on my dick now so it always hangs straight /v another neat feature of Hondas is garbage airbags they subcontracted - they replaced my airbags three times TWICE FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE. i drove a car with a faulty safety system for a freaking decade. done w Honda /v What if you park up hill and you want to get your shit out of there but you cant cuz it locked it self? Does now seem very ingenious now lol /v Some engineer at Honda must be really happy rn /v It's there to lock the door in case of a rear end collision. /v cool..ya coulda made this video about a minute and a half shorter tho just sayin /v I am not sure I understand correctly:\nIt sounds like you cannot open it when you are parked at a hill? /v my honda crv has this as well. couldnt really figure a use for it when i had my dash apart a saw it so i just taped it so it wouldnt lock. never thought of hills though! /v A man is washing his car with his son. The son asks...\n\nDad, can't you just use a sponge? /v mmm, neat. /v JALOPNIK is here :D http://jalopnik.com/this-one-little-engineering-detail-is-a-great-reminder-1803758960 /v 666 dislikes /v Wow dumb asf /v Idk if im amazed or bored?? /v What amazingness. Hail Trump for this goodness! /v Extra horsepower /v rip Honda /v good ole honda /v Lol /v Nifty /v vosprung japanese technikk /v The little bye at the end puts this video over the cringe meter, if it wasn't over it already. /v Mine got stuck yesterday morning and I can't get my fucking keys out !!! Without pulling out the dash!!!! WTF!!! Had to Uber to school!!!! /v One hand recording makes me rage....uggghhh /v If it deserved noticing you'd find the person who designed it, but you didn't. You just want people to see how smart you are, like a typical redditor. /v So for everyone who had one of these and could never figure out why they wouldn't open up while accelerating or driving uphill. Let's all do a 1 minute silence in their memories. /v You are shit at filming man. /v Its not for hills,but  mostly parkings i think. /v you should click clack drop and bang that thing around a few more times in your next video /v got confused by instructions of operation. DiCK gets stuck on box when going uphill. /v Really?  /v 0:32 deduce, not deduct /v How is this trending /v this vid makes me angry for some reason .. /v MOOOOOSIEBEAR!!!! he's so excited that he got to be the star of this video (clearly LOL) follow him on insta!! @moosetheminibully and go tell him that he should still love me even if i put him into a rainbow onesie HAHAH /v Moose /v Everybody loves baby d /v Suffer Woman /v hey twilight nice video /v part 2 please /v Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee /v I NEED MOREEEE /v Moosetheminibully!! /v You like guppy better - like\nYou like moose better - comment /v *suffer hooman* /v OMG its moose in boots!! /v OMG HER TSHIRT!! /v 1:05  WHADYA THINK  #simplynailogical /v Boop Boop /v OMG!

Ahh, I used to do a bit in high school... Fine you're drafted... Just giving the guy the benefit of doubt. /v Florida, putting the potato into emergency... /v Thank you!! As an ASL instructor, I will be sharing this version with my classes so they can truly understand how awful this was. /v That's some George Costanza level shit right there. /v Impersonating an interpreter during a state of emergency should get him some jail time. Hearing people would not put up with someone that mumbled through all that emergency info. Dude, you are a jerk! /v He should've just held up a sign that said RUN /v Can I comment on that whacked out lady talking here?  She's packing the kitties first and then the kids can come if their able?  She carries a stress pig and told everyone not to worry because she found a lucky penny?  Is this lady in charge of anything important? /v I don't know ASL, being Australian,  but I bet he's doing as good a job as YouTube's captions. /v This is no bueno, especially due to the circumstances. Thank goodness closed captioning for the hearing impaired is a necessary for all stations. /v Oh my, this is terrible! I hope the Deaf people do get to know what they were actually trying to say! /v Thank you for doing this!  This situation is absolutely appalling. /v To be fair, this guy IS better than Obama's interpreter at Nelson Mandela's memorial. /v This is unbelievable! How on earth did this happen?  Even if this guy was asked to interpret as a last resort he should have declined, knowing he doesn't know ASL! What made him think he could possibly wing It? Shame on everyone involved who allowed  this to happen, this is people's lives we are talking about. I can't imagine what it would be like to be a deaf person who needed to hear this information sitting at home with your children trying to understand what this moron is saying, I would have been so furious. I hope there are consequences for this moron. Unbelievable!!!! /v It's amazing how he spells words wrong by sign language too /v I understand the gravity of this situation, but I could not help but laugh. The subtitles vs the actual content was so wildly off I couldn't believe it. /v No. Just no. How? Who? Where did the find this interpreter? Tell me this is a joke made in really really poor taste.  /v Dude!!! I've been studying ASL on and off since I was 7...that being said I KNOW I can't do more than vocab words! (English grammar I got, ASL grammar is tricky to put into practice for me) Have some respect, if you know you can't keep up with the person speaking, one of his many problems, don't do it!! If you find fingerspelling tricky, another of his issues, don't do it! Finally, if you are not an actual interpreter or in any way fluent in ASK, his biggest issue...DONT DO IT!! Lives hang in the balance for something like this. /v He is not an interpreter.... he is a lifeguard who brother is deaf. Poor guy....caught up in the wrong situation /v This is so sad. /v 'ay, umm. anyone know asl?'\n'kinda'\n'YOU'RE HIRED!'\n\njust dont say you know it\ni know more than him and im 13, not deaf and dont know anybody deaf.\n god /v What I read in a news story (accuracy is unknown to me) is that he was pushed into doing this and never claimed to be a translator for the deaf, just has a deaf brother. \nThis has happened in the past and it was stated gov. translators would be screened and certified (or whatever) in the future. \nIf they were in a bind, they should have written up cards with the info on it for the deaf to read. Misinformation is usually worse than no information. /v He should be a congressman, they fake it everyday! /v lucky penny and stress pig?\n\nfuck my state /v My first job in high school was interpreting ASL with no certification for minor things in my neighborhood - also not paid at a real interpreters level, of course. Coming from Saint Augustine with FSDB, it's a more deaf-friendly city. I would imagine it's rarer to find signing hearing people in other areas. \n\nIt should be obvious that he was uncomfortable, so I instantly felt he must have been asked to interpret because of a lack of a certified interpreter under the circumstances. I have found myself in non-televised interpreting situations before that were too big for my britches. I would have been mortified if they were recorded. Please give him a break - he did his best, & it's a tough, high pressure situation to be in, especially on the spot. Let's not overlook the fact that he's serving in other ways, too, which is more than most can say at the moment. Give people a break - we all could use them sometimes.\n\n It may not have been ideal, but really people, a hurricane just went through our state. We've got bigger problems at the moment, & fortunately closed captions. Fortunately this was not a true *emergency* message (as far as I could tell), even though I know it must be isolating to the hard of hearing to be excluded from any message/update. So instead of spending our time pointing fingers, why don't we all just learn some sign language instead? /v Oh my goodness ... this is horrible . /v First off, it is unfortunate that the local FEMA representatives responsible for emergency operations AND the local municipal government failed to have a qualified resource available to interpret, it seems to me that the problem is more of educating THEM on the importance of having qualified interpreting resources.  People sometimes think that when someone says:  Oh, I know sign language they are qualified to interpret (maybe all they know is finger spelling!  I give them credit for at least attempting to have someone there versus not having anyone at all.  This is of NO FAULT of Marshall's and he clearly did not state he was an interpreter in the first place.  Too many things happening in too short of a time for a critical natural disaster such as hurricane Harvey and hurricane Irma do not always allow organizations sufficient time to plan these things at the last minute -- that's why they should have agreements in place and interpreters included in ALL Emergency Management plans.  Don't trash the person who at least attempted to help, trash the people who don't understand they could have caused more damage than good by not having a qualified interpreter available. /v Hi Jane! I am a reporter for ABC News and would like to speak with you about this video. Can you please message me when you have a chance?\nThank you. /v J.   i liked that. /v People getting offended but maybe they just did not have someone like they should have so they had John who did sign language in high school 2 decades ago to do it. /v This is like those dreams I have where I'm in a band playing a concert but don't know how to play the instrument /v He constantly looks at the speakers as if he needs to lip read too. /v Stuff like this is why 9/11 happened and every official in the US was like whoopsie daisy \_()_/ /v '''''interpreter''''' doing his thing with one hand....they are mocking us, it's so right in our faces....wake up people! /v It's like some unfortunate SNL sketch.  OMG how did this happen?? /v they should've gotten Lydia Callis fro NYS who did all of the Hurricane Sandy briefings. /v I shared this with my little circle....sorry to rant, excuse me, people fluent in sign language are better at spelling than a non ASL....am i correct??? i am just stunned!!! /v How does something like this even HAPPEN? /v I assume this unqualified interpreter knows we can all see his unqualified know-nothing ass. /v want flood? nice.. /v Wow. .. /v bear monster wants his pizza. /v And 1 thanks :D /v Maybe it's a different sign language language. /v Who low settle want flood?  Nice. /v i knew it!!! /v WTF??!! That's not ASL!!! /v We get signal! /v HE'S TRYING HIS BEST. IT'S AN EMERGENCY. DOGCAT! TOYS FUR! STOP BEING SUCH JUDGEMENTAL ARSEHOLES. PP NEED LEFT! /v This guy's fucked. /v https://youtu.be/QReUbe4kp-o /v This is terrible! /v WTF! /v OMG!! i can't get over it!!! I suspected thank you for confirming!!! OUCH! my heads gonna explode!!!! UGH!!! THIS IS EVIL! /v Thank you for captioning what the interpreter is signing to raise awareness of what was really interpreted for those unfamiliar with ASL. Devastating mistake to not have a certified interpreter at such a crucial time. Generates more problems/panic than simply relying on CC. /v Anyone know jive? /v No, he wasn't trying. You can tell he wasn't trying. Stop making excuses for someone who just couldn't do the job. No one could make him do anything. This is just awful. /v It's likely all the actual interpreters already evacuated and this guy along with other officials and rescuers were the only ones left. It's a shame he was thrown under the bus like this because he probably isn't trained as an interpreter and forced to do this. /v Make sure you take your Pets with you first and don't forget your kids.\n\nF*ck you Yanks are dumb, how many Muffin heads does it take to report on a Hurricane?!? /v To all the people trying to defend this man by saying it is not his fault that he's completely butchered ASL during this crucial time, OF COURSE IT IS. In no way should this guy have raised his hand if the county asked hey does anyone know sign language?. And if they were still pressuring him to partake, then fucking run away! This is so horrible. Very disappointing and shameful for all those involved. /v 2:23 Who Mexican /v Well she talked at the speed of light, give the guy a break. /v Please stop the hate speech.  You are all seeing a Lifeguard with a Deaf brother attempting to interpet.  This is an example of why interpeter training is required. /v if your deaf, and you rely on a random tv dude to inform you that a hurricane is\ncoming, then you've got bigger issues. this guy was not qualified for the task. obviously. but he volunteered to do it so as to not go totally without. so relax and stop taking about jail time. /v remember when that guy faked it during Obama's speech? he was an interpreter for like 20 years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn81s7BhunM /v It was him or nothing. He was roped into it because he knows a tiny bit of ASL. Give him a break. /v Is anyone else tired of these nanny state pressers. And how incompetent do you have to be to have to grab a faux deaf interpreter that knows very little sign language. Unfortunately this has been happening a lot lately. These are govt officials? This would rarely ever happen in the private sector. Someone should be fired over this. /v I am hard hearing and deaf too that Ican't believe it this interpreter is suck! He not really ASL and why someone want him interpreter for on news?to tell people warning not clear.His signing is AWFUL. I am shock. /v You can tell by the way he was dressed, etc, he was probably pulled from the crowd. Goes to show the ignorance of many local agencies and untrained masses. Unacceptable!!!  /v ITS ALL FAKE PEOPLE, FALSE FLAG ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS AS HELL /v 2:15 she has her lucky stress piggy and found a penny heads up, so all will be ok.  < \nlady not the interpreter.  The interpreter actually made more sense. /v This is absolutely hilarious. /v i could have done a better job and i'm ASL illiterate!!!! SORRY FOR SO MANY COMMENTS BUT I'M OFFENDED!!!! my heart drops into my stomach :-( /v Hi Jane, I'm a British journalist and think this is a great story that highlights a problem many people don't know exists -- would you mind my making a copy of the video / captions to share ? Could you send me a message at ericmunn01@gmail.com? Thanks in advance! /v If I was standing by where he stands, I would beat the shit out of him. This is unacceptable for fake interpreter. /v I Know that it's appalling if this is his best attempt at interpreting, but we need to also think that this might not be ASL, it could be international sign language, Spanish sign language, french, etc. I'm not saying that it is, but just think about the fact that it could be something different than ASL before we start condemning him. /v my dad is deaf glad he isn't in Florida /v Gee, at least he can get SOME of the actual words right. I always wondered how accurate sign language was.  Spoken language is difficult enough for the human mind to grasp; how meaning can be conveyed with these crude signals as rapidly as speech is tough to believe. BTW, in Japanese signing, WHITE people were referred to by using an open OK type gesture around the eye, signifying round eyes.  It conveyed the intended meaning BUT it was later judged 'racist' and it was changed.  My Gawd. /v Expect a new video, with news clips of hurricane irma as it happened, starting when it was still a Category 1 and ending after the aftermath.  Turn on notifications to see it tonight! /v 1:41:33 /v The category is comedy /v 1:52:00 wtf /v Guys its not my fault /v 4:40 here lies this video of a man who got his phone destroyed by irma, suspects say the man wanted to take pictures of the ocean while the storm was going. /v LOL at 1:41:30 /v What's that area right past that marker, an even more southern most point, lol /v Who watched the first 3 minutes than just started to go through the comments? /v how is a 8 hour video on trending? /v 5:30:15 FUCK YOU IRMA /v Ok, that's from last week.

Thanks for the recommendations! Question: What is your FAVORITE Hawker Center in Singapore and WHY? /v The last thing you want to do before bed is watching Mikey eat and telling you how good it is ..... but then again thanks for giving me an idea as to WHAT TO EAT LATER  /v great video i love the off into nowhere stalls /v You should really go to chomp chomp food centre at serangoon gardens theres really good barbeque food there /v Mike, your video series on the food in Singapore is probably the most LEGIT series of videos I've seen. The way you describe the food, the aroma, the texture, the fragrance, and the flavour. You get it! You most definitely get it! I mean... I've seen videos from big names come down here to taste our food, like Anthony Bourdain and Gordan Ramsay. They showcased our food and sang them praises, but you... you just GET IT!\n\nI only wish I had followed you on your other social media, I didn't realise you came down here! Also, you really managed to cover almost all the bases! From Bak Kut Teh to Briyani to Chicken rice. You definitely did all the homework, and were rewarded with some of the best dishes we have to offer the world!\n\nLove from Singapore! /v your food vlogs are the best! /v There is a bunch of crab roe in the shell , left and right side /v I dont know why im so annoyed by his thumbnail expression. Muntanga kasi. /v The names and prices disappeared too fast! /v please eat your rice with a spoon /v hi, are you still in singapore? /v I HATE YOU..\n\n\nyou need to post more often ;) /v YOU SHOULD MAKE A VIDEO WITH MARK WIENS & THE FOOD RANGER!!!!! /v Btw Mikey, I just saw another video from Mark Wiens today filmed In Israel......\nAmazing spectacular I mean it's pure & wholesome..... go watch it & u will see what I mean.....\n\nAlways good to learn from your good friends..... /v Ohhhh myyyyy those crabs YUMMI YUMMI /v 4 am, im watching this. welp need to get some snacks.. /v DO A COLAB WITH NOC FOODKING THE NEXT TIME YOU COME TO SINGAPORE /v Mike:when ever I think of Singapore I think of food \nMike let's be honest u always think of food /v Western Barbeque at that location has some amazing Chicken Chops /v Mike, why don't you come to India someday? I am quite sure the spicy Indian cuisine is tailor-made for you /v Fat makes the world go round along with the belly that grows with it /v Irma-gerd, I came back to Florida after the hurricane passed and I didn't have a hot meal since and when I watched the this, I literally was tortured with plates and plates full of delicious food. /v Food isn't what I would think of when I thought of Singapore... but now it is! /v I am feeling so salty right now /v seeing this is like seeing my childhood /v The thumbnail looks like you are barfing in a bowl !!! /v Proud to be singaporean /v Don't stick ur chopsticks vertically up, in Chinese believe, it is to invite ghosts to eat your food /v Why would you people want to watch this guy shove food\nIn his mouth your all robot followers. /v Bedok Blk 85 market (another hawker centre) is also really good! You HAVE to try the minced pork noodles, definitely THE best in Singapore. Although it's a huge debate as to which of the 3 there is the champion... /v I could smell the food, soo yummy!! /v Thought it was Jackie Chan /v Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how robot augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23 /v I didn't know you had a food channel!!! Always watched your main channel. Glad I found you again so I could subscribe again /v Check out this Victoria's Secret Garden Limited Edition Midnight Mimosa Silkening Body Splash 8.4 fl oz (250 ml) on BriskSale! https://brisksale.com/refer/59b7d705812c02582d2f3a94 /v When looking at the subtitle, everytime he say crab, it shows crap. It doesnt get any crappier than that /v Goes to old airport and doesnt eat roast paradise. living life wrongly. /v I live in Singapore i hope to see you /v Eating using just a fork /v As an Asian, I always cringe everytime Mike tries to scoop rice with a fork... /v use a spoon its more asian lol /v When he poured the curry in . I screamed NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! /v Proceeds to say that is eggy when it contains no eggs /v Out of many food vlogger, I trust Mike Chen's tastebud. If he says it's good, it's good. The way he describes food also perfect. /v NOC food king or this? /v waiting for a technology  which allows to share things through video!! /v how. just how does one eat this much. /v Visit Malaysia some day.. Food is awesome here too  /v Your darn camera is making me more hungrier. /v what do you show at 11.37 minute? /v Thank you!  I haven't seen Fish Ball Soup since i was a child.  It was as delicious watching as it ever was, maybe i need to plan a trip to Singapore just to eat right again. /v @strictly dumpling, when's the next Singapore video gonna be up dude:) /v Oh, I can't even begin to communicate my jealousy of the foods you have eaten.  I'm in landlocked D/FW where no seafood prospers.  Thank you for sharing your enjoyment; I happily live vicariously through you.  Cheers, brother. /v Hahaha... Mike, that bowl of fishball soup is just pure MSG and a bit of anchovies. The secret to the Hokkien Fried Noodles is the pork bone stock they use while frying it. The stock is absorbed into every strand of noodle and vermicelli to give it that intense flavour. I am a Singaporean by the way. /v Idk if I have the stomach for this **proceeds to devour crab** /v Thank you for always making me so hungry lmao /v I didn't know you had another channel. Made me think it was Jackie Chan in the thumbnail /v instead of being jckie chan you realy are a master of kung food /v STOP IT y=u making me want to go there to try it but that would be a waist of money cause that the only reason i would want to go uhhhhhhhh! /v its like final fantasy female character..sweet and perfect.. nice.. /v You talking with your hands makes me dizzy lol but I love all your videos.  /v What is fish tofu? /v Amazing food. I also love how you can just go there and see where the lines are and you just know that it's good. That's the kind of food culture I just don't see here in the Netherlands. A stall's best advertisement, is the length of its line. There's just no lines over here. /v I love fish balls! They are so tiny though. /v This guy bust three nuts every time this guy takes a bit of his food /v that crab is simply gorgeous!!! but ewwwwww u eat the innards  /v LOL...there are other flights if you miss your flight! /v Dude, you missed out on the Mutton Soup at Old Airport Road!!! Its the bomb! Arguably the Best on the Island! You've got to try it next time you;re in SGP! /v You should make an after-show called Strictly Dumping. I'd subscribe to that one /v Ya boy Mikey got the 60fps going on with food, making regular porn jealous /v how would the crab gods smile on you when your eating crabs? /v how HUGE is your stomach?!?! lol thats a crazy /v Like 'every single female Final Fantasy character.

They are about to release the iPhone x with wireless charging and it's in the news papers like it's an original thing.  Samsung have been doing wireless charging since the s6.   Wtf.... /v I wish iPhone 8 would make a bundle for those deaf people with a Cochlear Implant with a Nucleus 6 or lower. That would be a badass upgrade. /v are all those features coming to iphone 6 plus as well?,i know the update is compatible with iphone 6 plus but i don't if it may be limited by hardware on some features. /v LOL FINALLY GET A FILE EXPLORER BUT A SHIT ONE /v Samsung is having the last laugh they pretty much have all of samsung hardware /v hey where do you get your iPhone wallpapers from? /v Dude iPhone is so late on this features android been doing for years /v Android has done it before ... /v Anyone know where the posters in the background are from? /v Did you switch back from the Galaxy s8? /v I really want there to be a feature where you can download apps to record things your doing on your phone. They only have them on other types of phones but not for iOS devices. You can use hacks to download the apps but it will only let you for one minute. They should make it so it Doesn't show your battery percentage or time for privacy purposes. And so it is long than one minute. /v Can people just get android already? Lol we've been waiting for customisability... I sure haven't ... /v The document scanning (if it works correctly) will be great. Big day tomorrow for Apple!! btw 5203 notifications???

Can we drag and drop in iphone 7+ ? /v you GOTTA make the replace a laptop video - thats my no. 1 question!! /v Cool, but my android can do 80% of this already. /v people dont realize that its the little things that count /v Anything that allows us to customize and give a little bit more freedom, I'm up for it.\n\n\nTHEN SWITCH TO ANDROID.......... /v I'd love to see an iPad pro vs laptop video /v I thought there was gonna be new features and these features are taken from android smh /v Stuff that iPhone are coming out with andriod had that ages ago. And iphones are rip of just paying more for a bigger screen. I use to be a apple fan but when Steve jobs passed away they just went shit and ran out of ideas /v Tbh apple is better because it's more simple. I recently got an android and it took me forever to get cellar data on /v My droid is better then any iPhone /v I've been here since 500K /v I think the way youtubers talk at their audience is cringe. /v Damn! Can you be my average gay daddy!? Lmao you so fine I mean cmon its gonna be a grapefruit night for you all the time  #iFinnahavewetdreamstonight /v Wow, apple devices getting features android has had for years... I can't wait to see the excitement on my apple friends faces... /v Oh NO WAY! So the new features are just simple things samsung have been using since 2010. That is great;) /v Been on Android for a while. Might give Apple 1 more chance. /v I already have it lol  /v Can I get your wallpaper at 0:36?  /v im most excited for a built in screen recorder, what do you think of it ? /v How to start a war\n\n\n\n\nAndroid sucks /v Animated emoji's only for iPhone X or edition with face ID /v So nothing unique/innovative as usual, cool /v Please make a video about an iPad Pro replacing your laptop, I want to see which one is better for me based on your feedback. Thanks!!  /v Haha jokes on you ppl I have iOS 11 already /v I have it already hmu if u want it right away fam /v new sub! been watching for a while now tho. love those day in the life videos, keep up the great work. /v My friend had the beta of this. The next day his phone broke. We told him he should've waited /v I definitely think a video on whether or not the iPad Pro can replace your laptop would be a great idea. The current generation was fairly close to replacing my laptop for classroom purposes, but I still needed my laptop most of the time. Maybe the new variation will be closer to replacing a laptop completely! /v Feature 1 after buying your wallet is empty like the clean water in africa /v I actually have the beta and it freezes so much /v I want that video /v Love the pictures on your wall #ff4eva /v Swipe down notification bar gesture already built in to Samsung launcher /v Why does the s pen sound silly? It's a gotdam note...the whole point of the phone! /v Nice tips but imho the new Samsung UI has outdone Nova launcher. With the theme store, as you said you can have whatever look you want including icons which really is far better than what's on Nova, which really is just an additional skin on an already better skin and a waste of resources. /v Dual window is a great feature /v Dude...I just set up my Spotify/Maps app pair as well. Lol /v More like 8 things you don't care about. /v Love my unlocked note 8. No bloat, except Sammy apps but I use a lot of them. /v Note 8 comes with best ever design & features i have seen in note series but its highly over priced  /v TO COMPARE PRODUCTS & PRICES ETC-http://www.qoo10.sg/gallery/Q108030459 /v finally some dark themeagenice tips /v Really Awesome Kevin, really thinking about getting this phone. /v Galaxy things note to 8 do /v Great video best tip is the disabling of the Bloatware Sprint has so many  /v Could you please share the nova launcher back up file? I really could use that set up on my S8! Thanks @TechNinjaSpeaks /v The wallpaper please? /v http://tz.ucweb.com/9_1aCSt /v wallpapers from???? /v Good tips bro /v Another great video! /v Wallpapers? /v Awesome one /v 1: You didn't mention DEVELOPER options and reducing animation speed\n\n2: Why don't ya people HIDE THOSE DAM NAVIGATION BUTTONS!! /v First five things aren't enough, first 10 things are too much!! First eight things? That's perfect, oh wait I get it ! 8 things for the Note 8 OMFG /v #NotificationSquad /v Hey whats the wallpaper used on homescreen? Would like to have a copy.. thanks /v Something I hate from Samsung backup is that it doesn't keep passwords in apps LIKE IOS ICLOUD BACK UP DOES. Other than that is very handy. /v Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise is the best clown performance since Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight /v No no no, Amy Adams better not be in the sequel. She ruined Louis Lane but she better not ruin Beverley. /v Nothing, I don't get that scared. /v I enjoyed this take on the movie but it was a Comedy.\nI didn't find this penny wise as terrifying as Tim Currys.\nAnd I didn't understand why his head kept getting bigger I some scenes.\nThe George scenes was good and I didn't think they would go there.\nAnd l believe the George and bill truly loved each other the as for the friends.\nIt was bull, no friend that are bought together by bullies would act like that towards each other.\nAlso spinning the camera or shaking the camera doesn't make this the most terrifying movie you will see this year.\nWell I hope not or the horror genre is done.\nI rate this comedy 7/10. /v Mike was supposed to be the historian but they gave his important role to the fat kid. I preferred the book because he was one of the few black characters in fiction given development, racism in the 80s was addressed, and he wasn't stereotypical, but in this movie they tokenized him. /v Was that the creature in rudolf the red nosed reindeer? The bumble? I saw that as a kid and it seriously freaked me out. It scared me. The stop motion added to the creep factor. For me it was something that stuck in my head for years afterwards. Now at 49 its still creepy and yeah I wouldn't want to see it in a dark alley. /v A whale, it would turn into a whale and i'll die isntantly /v YES! A boggart is immediately what I thought of when they started incorporating their individual fears. I can't help but wonder if JK Rowling read this at some point and that's how the idea of a boggart formed. /v Pennywise's friendliness is basically like a shield. It only works once, before your cover's blown. /v the worst thing that IT could be is to shape shift into is Chris stuckman wearing a jeremy Jahns disguise trying to give a movie review on as good as jeremy jahns but failing horribly! lololol /v If It bleeds... we can kill It. /v It would turn into an accountant telling me to fill my time sheets for the week /v Pinhead  from hellraiser, that will be my worst nigthmare. /v Once you finish the book, can you do a Spoiler Review of It?:) /v Joseph Gordon Lovett would be interesting it see /v This movie was way too cheesy for me, not scary at all, and the cgi was terrible, and I've already seen this plot done 1000 times, I think it's over rated /v i dont think that the reason Pennywise did not killed Beverly was because she was not scared, i think that it had to do with the fact that he realized that she is not longer a kid, because right before he was going to killed her he smelled something, it It was supposed to only eat kids at this point, or at least that is what i felt like for me /v I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!. I literally HATE horror movies. But oh my godddd I was SO creeped out by this movie! I was grabbing my boyfriend's arm the whole time and squeezing it,when usually in a horror movie I'm like YAAWWWNNNN. \n\n\nI give this a 9.8 out of 10. /v Glad to hear you're reading the book, when you finish it can you do a video on it. Thatd be dope /v I swear when they do the sequel to It I can totally see Amy Adams playing the grown up version of the red headed girl in this movie /v The pharmacy scene where Beverly says the man looks like Clark Kent & he says she's lois lane and everyone in the cinema just cringed and went ew /v If you add a bit of film grain to your backgrounds it would get rid of the banding, or some slight noise ~ probably make your videos look cleaner /v I would totally love to see you review the book. Have fun with the ending for part 1. /v Pretty sure this movie gave me PTSD on top of my PTSD\nFucking awesome movie though /v I heard it wasn't that good. I heard the IT character really wasn't that scary. Not only that, it gives no explanation as to why this creature has to come out and feed every 27 years.  Any of the other decent horror movies atleast has a reason why they do what they do. Freddie was killed in a furnace, Krampus exists to teach bad children a lesson. What is IT's reason? And if he's a spider again, that's going to be soooo fucking lame! :P /v it would turn into taxes or an empty bank account  /v I am legitimately afraid of fame (no really, I'm actually serious. Not having your own privacy ever again, being stalked by some overly crazy fans to where you feel like your life is threatened, people thinking they have the right to your image, eyes following your every move, taking pictures, not sure whether people love you for the fame or for yourself, never able to be just another face in the crowd again, etc. It's all very terrifying and awful to me. I would work hard my whole life to never be famous).\n\nSo would that mean _It_ would show up in the form of Lady Gaga and tell me I'm going on tour with her? /v Pretty sure Jeremy just said the word it a thousand times lol /v This movie was fucking ruined for me.\nI haven't been to the theaters since 2015 and i don't plan to ever go again in the future.\nPEOPLE, I PAY TO WATCH A MOVIE IN THEATERS, NOT TO HEAR YOU FUCKS TALK OR HECKLE!!!!\n\nLiterally everyone was laughing like this was a fucking comedy. There was parts where it was dead serious and\npeople couldn't stop laughing. Even had people yelling out comments during the movie. \n\nI'm just going to watch the second movie at home. I hate inconsiderate people! /v It turning into a Giant Wasp, Hornet or Yellow Jacket Bees.  That would scare the hell out of me. /v It is a fucking alien, in the book /v What I really like about this movie is how Billy went through the five stages of grief. \n\nDenial-Doesn't believe that Georgie is dead\n\nAnger-Lashes out his friends on not helping him finding Georgie\n\nBargain-Putting his friend's lives on the line all over in finding Georgie\n\nDepression-Both his bargain and anger cost his friendship for a short time.\n\nAcceptance-Accepting the fact that Georgie is dead and shot Pennywise in the forehead while he took the form of Georgie.\n\nSeriously, was anyone on the verge in tears when Georgie was killed, follow by Billy finding Georgie and wanting to go home? /v Do u agree that girl in that painting looks like mama? /v The thing goes KA KA Ka poom poom , I said the mans not hot ! /v I would see my wife /v im scared of death and failure that's it /v A giant moth. Like the size of a dog, or a car, or a bus. If you've ever seen a picture a moth up close, you know that shit would be scary as fuck if it were huge. /v A giant spider like from jumanji but bigger /v Sophia Lillis was so good in the movie as Bev. She's gonna conquer Hollywood one day with her amazing talent. /v And stop using that stupid ass Harry Potter reffrence if anything a Bogert or whatever is a copy of IT.. /v there is one fear that still sometimes freaks me out... and that is the dead mangled Body of Emmett Till. I saw it in school when i was in 6th grade and the teachers had to make sure i was out of the room if they showed it.... sometimes i still have nightmares and that image is there.  OORR... there was a Sherlock Homes mystery exhibit that went around called the Clock tower mystery, and there was a mannequin upside down dead  all chained up in a box.... scariest shit ever!!!!!! if anyone knows what I'm talking about.... that shit was scary to a kid. /v That scene after Beverly kills her father in the bathroom was the worst jumpscare I ever had in my life, I even lost my breathe for a few seconds! O.O /v It would be a positive error proof test! Terrifying!! /v IT would turn into me killing myself /v That blood oath at the end though. Dude, this was set in the 80s they showed absolutely no f**king fear about getting AIDS \n\nAlso, is it just me or does the kid playing Stan look like a young version of the late Anton Yelchin \n\nFinally, I think you should play the adult version of Ritchie, Jeremy  Do what you do best  /v I just got back from watching IT and it was so good /v Georgie was afraid of the dark... Not clowns. That's what IT killed him /v I think it would be awesome if Seth Green played Richie considering he was Richie 27 years ago. He's the right age and still pretty funny. It would be awesome to bring the original cast back to tie to two movies together. They would just need a new Billy since the original actor died. /v For some reason I remember the Creature from the Black Lagoon killing Eddie Corcoran in the book not a bully. Correct me if I'm wrong. /v Well now that I've seen the movie it would be pennywise lol. I'd literally shit my pants if i saw pennywise because I've seen what he can do and i would not be rational enough to think, don't be afraid because i have no friends to back me up lol /v IT is an alien  spider  /v The yetti monster from Rudolph scared me as a kid to lol  /v Then I guess IT will be me. Fuck. /v If the kid actors in the mini tv show play as the adults in part 2 that would be awesome /v I would probly get a form of a spider or some type of giant insect much like the old film. I loved this movie by the way, it was way better than I was expecting which is rare in horrer movies for me. /v I halfway thought this movie was going to go Troll2 and all the adults in Derry were the damn devil. /v if you see the same thing that scared you once before eventually you would get use to it see it again and every time you live and get away fine you would be less afraid so pennywise needs to change it up /v I think It would turn into the Nemesis from RE3 because I was scared of the it. /v Bryce Dallas Howard better play adult Elizabeth dammit! I wanna see those high heels in action again /v I want Molly Ringwald to play Beverly just because of that one gag where Richie snarked about it. /v I thought it was ok. /v the thumbnail is a huge spoiler /v Why doesn't pennywise just take the form of a giant rock? /v Can someone tell me this: What was Ben afraid of exactly? His scene in the library, following easter eggs, then being chased by a headless body... and then in the sewer, IT turned into a mummy...\nSo... is he just afraid of dead bodies or what? /v Dude right on the money with that Bumble reference that thing freaked me out when I was a kid... /v my biggest fear is clostorfobia or the fear of being in a small space btw what do you think that whould look like /v If It came to kill me, It'd probably take the form of the Babadook. /v I really hope this doesn't bring back the clown waiting in the woods trend. /v pennywise would turn into you being a accredited film reviewer and having influence over the industry with your shit taste in movies /v I honestly don't know what my biggest fears are. Ironic. Guess I'll know if I'm ever forced into it /v Why do you wanna know what I'm afraid of???? What are you gonna do with that information?????? /v good thing they didn't have the sewer orgy /v a giant swarm of ants... that's the thing i fear most in life. or larva. basically any swarm of any bug /v Multiple rats that climb over me, pennywise could eat me right there because I would be in so much fear. /v U have really sexy eyes. /v The scariest scene in the movie for me was the basement scene where Georgie looked muddy and bloody and how pennywise grabbed his body into the water....this movie was great /v I was literally thinking she looked like Amy Adams throughout that whole movie. /v Can Pennywise turn into myself if I'm afraid of myself enough? /v Beverly has to end up with the chubby boy /v Just wait 27 more years for the child actors to become adults /v I like how the director put in mama as one of the monsters. /v IT would take the form of a mass of darkness, and all I would see is nothing as I felt and heard various things before IT chewed off my fucking face. /v I actually found the movie to be pretty sad. Seriously, I felt more sad than scared when the kids were attacked because they were so relatable! I felt so bad for georgie when he was crying /v batman wouldnt have been afraid /v Necromorph from Dead Space. /v a big ass tarantula /v That Doom tee though :D <3 /v Cocodrile /v Broken screen iPhone /v Large marge /v Donald trump /v I guarantee you the black kid is being played by John Boyega. GUARANTEED /v That damn walkie talkie feedback got me twice /v a xenomorph or jaws /v He's Over Hear Spilling HAMBUGER HELPER /v A hurricane /v I. Hate. Clowns. /v Freddy Kruger I hate him /v two words... Giant Spider.... /v An old man /v Black queen /v Sexy black queen. Got damn I love her smile! /v Can we just say that Sloane Stephens is gorgeous? /v dayummmm she's beautiful /v Yoooo I love this girl  /v Black girl magic  /v Id hit /v Sloane is hilarious so proud of her! /v Sloane fine as hell. Beautiful. /v Talented, cute and very witty.  The latter makes her 5x cuter. /v She is so cute. /v She is so pretty /v I'd have 15 kids with her /v I'd sniff it /v #TMT /v Wtf is this. The White House press briefing. I do agree with her when it comes to the money. Appreciate the honesty. /v this is the most ridiculous i ve ever heard in a long time by a so called reporter ...if she wants to win another trophy and have that feeling again ??? wtf ....great reaction and answer by sloane ...tennis has a new big star !! /v Damn she sexy /v better than Self Haters Serena and Venus /v Ugh I love black women. She's so hot. Gawd. that's a wife right there. /v Lovely /v She looks good! /v Stupid ass ESPN. She wasn't joking she was mocking those stupid reporters questions. Good for her. /v Why does ESPN allow the most stupid reporters and questions to be asked #BoycottESPN /v She can get it /v Get that money girl!!!! /v Capitalism for the win! /v her comments made her even more hotter it's stratospheric lvl's /v Capitalism is the best. /v ahh, the honor of sport. to be the best, the pinnacle of human achievement. the toil and sweat and dedication it takes to truly master a craft so thoroughly as to be better than all others. and did you see that check?? gurrllll.... /v Why is talking about getting a fat pay check? /v wtf are all these black people comments lmao /v Rule number 1: Stay away from black pants sagging thugs. \nNumber 2: ignore their friend requests on social  media.\nNumber 3: Don't do reality shows. /v Well Madison got a million dollars, I'm sure she'll be fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat had me dead and rolling /v She looks good. I don't know much about her personality, but she's photogenic. As for her game, she doesn't have a power game, her game depends on long rallies and disciplined defensive play. It can make for a long career, but hard to dominate with that style. Overall, is a star born? We'll see /v 'There & Back' - A Solar Project For UNICEF would be much more entertaining! And $3.7 million would kick it off nicely. /v She speaks the truth. /v Loool cheeky /v I don't think she was joking lmao I'm bout to pick up a racket /v I don't get the shock over the money. The players don't know what the prize money is ahead of time? /v I love her personality, and that dimple /v That personality is what makes her gorgeous to me. /v Get that check boo... Love her responses /v Damn 3.7 mil? Since when did it become this much. /v I don't follow tennis, but I must say she's very pretty, seems down to earth too /v Very proud of this young lady. /v Whats with all the thirsty people in the comments, its like theyve never seen a woman before  /v Its good humour with some truth and a great answer to a stupid question. And yes she is hot /v There was no joking around  /v She played incredibly the entire tournament I hope she continues to do well, Madison keys also these young women are the next big talents. /v This is the lightest and most  happy I have seen Sloan Stephens. \nI love it. Cheers to you Sloan.  /v That bih Rich, Jk but she is extremely beautiful tho. /v Don't think it's a joke tho  /v Congratulations to this funny, scrumptious snack and fellow floridian for her first grand slam title.Hopefully it's the first of many. /v Sloane Stephens sounds like she needs to be in a comic book or something. Breaking up asteroids with a tennis ball. /v I think I love her /v Hahaha epic /v Superb lady I love her sass. /v Cheque /v 55,000 views equals trending because sports. /v *Cheque /v Money > Passion  /v Black people! /v Sloane Stephens is an inspiration and hella hilarious. /v Wife goals /v Sloane  /v She happy af /v She fit af /v Nahhh that wasn't no joke  /v we know she aint joking lmao /v Ain't a joke /v lol 'jokes' /v LOL /v check.... check.... .... oh....oh...... espn means cheque.... /v  /v I like her  /v Are you watching Serena? Get off your Ass and start training /v Destined for #1....SHE IS A BREATHE OF FRESH AIR..JUST WHAT TENNIS NEEDS..CONGRATS!!!! /v She'd still get whooped by even an amateur male player, though. /v I saw Sloane Stephens during an interview acting like an infantile, spoiled child pretending to be afraid of a miniscule insect flying around her head. Does she think  it's sexy to play a dumb blonde? What an embarrassing attitude for such a great player! /v i wanna see her ass /v Im sorry for Anderson. Nadal will destroy him badly. /v ,,, US Air Force Rescues/Evacuated 22 ISIS Field Commanders From Deir Ezzor to safer regions on September 8, 2017.\n,,, @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXDTTjgs8nY /v Ok now i have a reason to watch Tennis. /v Beautiful Black Queen /v She's a star /v Great player seems like a good person and she is gorgeous /v more black supremacy /v We get it, she's black. I'm black. We are all black.\n\nYou guys continuously complementing her on her blackness proves that black people are ugly since you guys overcompensate her blackness to beauty.\n\nIt shows how rare it is to see a pretty black girl.\n\nShut the fuck up /v Lmaoo she doing her thing /v WAIT! BLM told me all black people have it hard and whites dont... Where the fuck is my 3.7 mill? /v Tennis def has a new star. I cant wait for that Serena vs Sloane matchup. /v Good thing she wasn't white... They still feel the need to play these fuck fuck games about equality.... /v Fucking nigger... looks like a man /v SUPREME BLACK DNA !!!   Fuck off Sharapova!! /v To the comment section coming frm a black woman.. we get it she's black. Sound like yall over compensating /v I love this girl.   Finally,  a top women's player with personality. /v I actually love her, I like her better than Serena /v no class whatsoever /v Too many niggers in these comments /v When I die. I want to come back as a killer whale. /v Those seals at 2:00 like we out! /v Hey we should put those killer whales in tanks and swim with them! /v Very good footage, especialy for me, that loves Cetaceans. They are just M A J E S T I C .I cant even have a favorite species.. \nAll cetaceans are cool on their own way: \n\nOrcas are Huge predators but wont prey on humans for some reason.\nBowheads can live up to 200 years and they live on cold polar waters.\nBlue Whales are the biggest animal that ever lived and its vocalization is deafening.\nSperm whales can dive very deep to search for food, sleep verticaly and use sonar to see when there is no light.\nHumpbacks jump over the water, dance with its mate and have the most beautiful vocalization, almost like singing.\nThe List Goes On...\n\nCetaceans are something special. /v Where are Paul Watson and the Sea Shepard when you need them? /v and the PG BBC strikes again /v Christ Almighty, they're not whales, they're orca or giants of the dolphin genre. /v It's really annoying that the killer whales seemingly never fail. I'd like to see something get away for once lol /v That's what Trump wants to do to the Mexicans, Black's, Jewish, Women, Muslims, and non-racist Americans /v where were the mikne crew? /v If I was the minke I was stop and go for the male 1v1 me broooooo /v Evil exists in nature, who creatures nature is god, so god is evil /v i dont blame them. having lived with innuits and eaten minke.....\nits like beef of the ocean. so tender though...\n\nseriously its like red meat but as soft as fish.... innuits eat the fat too... that just tastes like fishy greasy fat.\n\nbut the meat? 10/10. im with the killers on this 1 /v Who saw those sea creatures at 2:01 /v Why dont they bite it to death instead of racing for 2 hours? /v This commentator can give life to a standing still vase on kitchen table !!  /v Why doesn't the Minke whale dive deep? /v You know what they say, the bigger the dorsal fin.. /v What a happy ending! /v The feminist killers be wantin' the same size dorsal fin as the males. /v Don't worry Guys, the killer whales are only doing scientific research /v Seagulls and sea birds should be referred to as sea vultures /v This video edit sucks!\n\n Were are the Ariel shots??? /v I'm more concerned on how cold the water is /v Killer Whale is a perversion of Whale Killer /v Orcas have big jaws with large teeth yet they don't initiate their attack with bites, i guess that's because they don't have claws to grab their prey or pin them down like big cats.  Water is just air, and ocean mammals are quite slippery too, or maybe orcas are gentlemen and ladies, they don't want to dine like thugs like hyenas lol. /v The wolfs of the sea /v Oh Minke, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Minke! /v It's amazing. Killer Whales are truly the apex predators of the sea, because they have no natural predators (not including humans). They are so intelligent, and are even more intelligent than our own dogs and even some apes. \n\nSad that we have to imprison them in asylums for our entertainment. /v The way orcas hunt is scary but  it's an incredible footage. Circle of life. /v I really like your videos, but would be nice if they would have subtitles, English subtitles I mean. Thank you. /v Forget Shark Week... there needs to be a Killer Whale week!!!! /v No PC BS here. /v I wish Japanese ate killerwhales  /v These prey animals have no sense of pride. I would have biten the fin or tail off one of the orcas. At least you take some out before you go. /v Hungry Beasts  but no matter what I would still love nature  /v MashAllah /v tear...for the minki /v Finally Type A Orca get some recognition /v Where is the under water cam when you need one /v Does your minky have a license? /v Orcas literally operate in gangs and jump other whales. Break yo self! /v 2:06 - 2:12 When everybody goes to the gorge on Karelia in War Thunder Ground Forces /v well, you know what they say about whales with big fins... /v Could you see a Rainbow 4:13 ? \nOn the left side /v Beautiful. I love when animals act like animals. Now if we can just get people to be more human; that's would be worth a 5min video. /v I  Attenborough's narration. Whatever he does, its natural. I think he did for pocoyo, didn't he? /v This is how nature balance its self /v Strange, the killers never intended to eat the minke. /v baby minke + easy to kill - orcas like us are lazy :) -- adults too much work /v But whale hunting is illegal!  Someone should arrest these orcas and turn them into vegans. /v I reall hope there will be 4k content in this channel. /v David Attenborough his voice is so profound /v No justice in nature. /v They weren't this scary at the SeaWorld...crazy /v Green Peace shall protest against this cruelty. Down with the killer whales and sea gulls! /v Why did the BBC not intervene? Humans should provide food for all wildlife to prevent this from happening /v People have no empathy for animals. They're all caught up in their narrative. /v I love orcas so much! /v Nice video  /v Lol those two penguins/seals at 2:00 /v Absolutely beautiful... /v  /v #EarthGoHard /v HUMANS R SO EVIL!!1!!!!1!!11 /v For me Sir David Attenborough  /v RACE WAR /v Genius .... /v Aw1800ful. /v Beautiful!!! /v :( /v 3:36 Aw, he dead /v ohh poor Minkie  /v It's the circleeee of LIIIIIIIFE /v The fact you hear that final blow crash like that the power is amazing /v Why don't rorqual whales dive to escape predation by orcas? /v Nature is a real f.  The Minke gave it a run. /v thats a bad way to go. RIP Minke /v Seems wrong. /v Killer whales are not whales, mate. 0:37 /v Circle of life!  /v God I love Orcas /v ORCAS****** /v animal cruilty /v Wow that was amazing /v 4:13 Random rainbow. /v They sound like giant killer squeak toys. /v I LIKE FUZZY WHALE /v Incredible footage! You guys are amazing. /v 2:01 penguins! /v whales /v Brutal /v good game whale played /v Orcas are just as vicious underwater as the wild dogs on the land.  /v There's a tag on the Minke's chin at 4:17 /v Does anyone else just hate the way killer whales kill their prey?  It's just so sad /v Orcas are dolphins not whales  Mike drop /v I wonder why they didn't bite it at first /v There are other whales...killer.  Killer whales aren't actually whales;they're orcas. /v What happened to calling them their proper name: orcas, instead of killer whales. I expect better from the BBC. /v How the hell did I not know about this channel? I love food porn /v I don't get it , why any dislikes at all? /v More cheese please :D /v Yummmyyyyyyyyy \nWho love chicken and cheese??? \nLike if you love  them plzzzzz..... /v The REAL chicken Alfredo is better /v I'll take all of it please and thanks. /v Definitely looks delicious, and almost certainly is delicious, but... cook the chicken, cook the bacon, find/make Alfredo sauce, assemble all other ingredients, THEN start making this recipe...

Dark and beautiful.  /v Sloan is Hot /v I'm so proud of Sloan and Madison! Wishing them all the best in the future. /v Boi If that ain't a chocolate masterpiece /v Bout time girl about time! I'm so proud /v Stephens is a sistah?? Wow didn't know. Good job to this beautiful black queen. /v Those dimple's /v white folks are pissed it wasnt maria sharapova winning up there....Instead they get Serena 2.0 /v I really like both of these young ladies so much that I would have been thrilled by either of them winning the match -- U.S. women's tennis is in great shape! They are great sportswomen and role models for the game, carry themselves with class and dignity, work so hard and are continually improving their games (doh!), and I couldn't be happier for Sloane and Madison!

Very classy and beautiful champion Sloan Stevens /v Congratulations to this beautiful, powerful Nubian Goddess  /v Thats some hot chocolate right there! /v I. Wanna learn how to play tennis  ? I live in Houston any classes you would recommend cause I really wanna learn! My dreams stars are Venus Solane Serena and Sharpovia /v One of the realists already, just watch her interview. /v If you look at how Sloane play, she always stays calm under pressure, during all her matches, if she remains that way but learn to hit like Serena she would be unstoppable. /v #blackexcellence  /v 48 thumbs down on this lol. There are some sick shits in this world for sure! Some people are criminally insane and some others need to be admitted for being primitive in the brain. /v I love Sloane, seems she has a lovely personality, congratulations. /v They taking over tennis too /v Watch out niggas might start swimmin and diving lol /v People in comments talk about race, but all I see is an American. /v such a pretty girl, lots of class too. I like this girl... /v She looks like a nigga I use to loot with. /v To see someone that looks like me. Do this. Is the best feeling in the world. Oh how we have come so far. Great sportsmanship ladies!! /v quality of women's tennis is not even one tenth of men's. Why the prize money is the same for men and women? /v she is gorg! Chocolate with dimples...congrads girl /v Sloan's dimples are so cute. I'm happy for her. /v so proud of her! /v Her private life is her own. /v how does drug testing work at the us open and how often do players get caught /v Wish I can hug them /v http://blackmeninamerica.com/tennis-there-is-a-new-sheriff-in-town-sloane-stephens/ Sports in America where it is never as simple as Black and White! /v Way to go, Sloane!!!!

Sorry to say but so true. /v Love there friendship is showed in the embrace they both played great I love u Sloan !!!!! /v Wait.... There are nore black tennis players in the world? /v She's not getting much media coverage. /v Nike is like fuck we never get the underdog athletes that rose from nowhere /v Wow, I remember watch a small espn clip on Stephens, as a rookie with promise, a couple years ago. Now she just won the US open. /v So beautiful and very very classy! Congratulations!! I also loved her phone conversation with her Grandfather. /v Would've been funnier if the title read stole the title\n\n\nCome at me snowflakes /v Incoming comments from racist whites who can't handle black women dominating traditionally white sports like Tennis. Sloane will join Serena and Venus as legends /v Her coach comes from my high school. He graduated in 1996 /v When I saw two Americans, I wondered if I misread the video title. I guess the American women--besides Serena--are faring better than the men. Congratulations! /v See that? Thats genuine athleticism and great sportsmanship. Great job to Sloane /v I'm really upset and pissed off why in the heck can't we have this kick in the pants sport,  tennis in San Francisco's AT&T park.

I DON'T EVEN WATCH TENNIS OR KNOW WHO THIS IS, BUT YEAH AMERICA!!!!! /v great to see pass the torch Venus and Serena\nbeautiful /v 0:17 They ask you how you are.... /v This was an epic Women's US Open finals. \nIt will go down in history as one of the best.\nSloan Stephens was very relaxed & and 6 unforced errors. That was pretty awesome.\nMadison Keys will come back and win soon. \nBoth ladies were pretty awesome. /v A new black chick in tennis /v Congratulations Sloane Stephens on your first Grand Slam championship. I was pulling for Keys but I'm still happy about your win instead. I'm counting on Stephens, CoCo, and Keys to all three carry the US women's field after Vunus and Serena and for y'all to pummel all those European screaming cheaters. Well done Sloane!!!! /v This?

Much better looking that either of the Williams sisters----who both look like gorillas. /v Who cares about this basket weaving sport /v Love this, and am so proud of both.\n\nTook everything on Sloane's behalf - everything.\n\nIf only both of them could have won. /v I think this is great for American Tennis,  Williams sister as legendary as they are, they will be retiring in next few years, this girl is very likable and a fighter... I think people will like her to win moreso than William sisters. I hope she becomes the future of American Tennis /v katrina pierson is literally a black hillary, disgusting /v Is Sloane wearing a weave? /v Black people are physically strong I feel sorry for the others lol /v Way hotter than those other ugly sisters /v IS SHE ON STEROIDS TOO? LIKE VENUS AND HER BROTHER OF A SISTER? /v As soon as I find out you're another piece of sexual colored meat for white boys you'll be no.3 on my list of black females wishing misery on behind those sorry ass white dick loving Williams sisters. /v Sloan is Boring,her game is Boring, her reaction to this win was Boring....yawn..gnite /v Just incredible Terry!  You da man! /v Totally Awesome! /v Beautiful work Terry. /v Beautiful! /v Hi Terry! I just spent the last couple of days reading through the build log on HMEM and this is just an amazing piece of work. Beautiful! Excellent work, sir! /v Very Nice one there Sir WTG /v Outstanding. /v Whatever, I'm not crying,you're crying! /v The muppets should do more live shows. /v When you see the Muppets live and in person, it really makes you feel like you want to meet them and believe me, that's how I feel. /v Alright Vogel, you've won me over. /v I kind of here Jim Henson in this new Kermit voice. Nice work Matt, keep it going. /v I always loved the rainbow connection song it ages like fine wine and I hope Jim Henson is looking at this and is proud of his creations /v Now Kermit doesn't sound so much like Constantine when he sings. /v I frequently listen to the soundtrack for The Muppet Movie (1979), and Matt legitimately sounds like Jim here to me. I'm officially settled in and content with Matt as Kermit. /v This song makes me cry, because I am having a hard time with my cat Annie right now. I have a feeling that she is gonna make her rainbow connection soon. /v I'm going to cry. Kermit is my spirit animal /v Thanks for recording this.. I was too busy being in tears from happiness and my love of this amazing show, and my handsome Kermie.. I was so overwhelmed! I still get watery eyed just thinking of how beautiful this was. This night will be forever in my heart! I've done it.. I've seen.. R.e.m., the Monkees, Jason mraz, Penn and Teller, Adam Sandler and now my muppets.. thanks Henson and Disney! I wish life really was this positive and fun! Best night ever!  /v Somebody put this on TV, that was amazing. /v he sounds like jim henson /v PAUL WILLIAMS! YEAH! /v I want Steve Whitmire back SO MUCH, but I have to admit Matt Vogel isn't as terrible as I thought. He kinda sounds like Jim Henson, God rest his soul /v OK, so I know everyone including me came to this video to see Matt's singing voice as Kermit, but watch Paul for a minute...is he lip syncing...? /v I love that the Muppets can still be so well received so many years after its debut. /v What's the big frigging deal here. Sounds a llittle like Jim but everyone has their own voice when it comes to voice acting. Im a voice actor but Im not spot on when it comes to voicing William Shatner. /v I love the new Kermit. His little, Ok? Here we go won me over. /v It's amazing that the muppets still have a big impact on pop culture to this day. But I imagined that at the climax of the song a hologram projection of Jim Henson walked to Kermit and joined him and everyone else as like a tribute. Also so younger fans can get to know the mastermind of one of the greatest shows of all time /v Say what you want about the voice, but the tiny little mannerisms in the hand movements are spot on to Jim /v I'm glad that a variety of muppets showed up. /v Taking my wife and son to tonight's concert! /v I was there, it was awesome!! /v Walter was there!!!  /v That sounded beautiful!!!!! /v Awesome I love that song /v I love the muppets R.I.P Jim Henson  /v Ahh my good friends the muppets /v this was beautiful. Matt, thank you for bringing Jim back to Kermit /v Holy crap, Kermit and Paul Williams!  Mr. Vogel you did a good job. I'd love to see a live Muppet show. *ahem US tour *ahem /v This is amazing! I love his voice he sounds like Jim. /v Only you Kermit with your beautiful voice, can understand my sorrows. /v You know I never heard it before but now I think matt vogel sounds more like jim Henson when he sings. /v I love this song...we sung it at my 6th grade graduation...eons ago /v These guys will never grow old to us for sure /v The Muppets are just amazing. They are this beautiful experience that every generation can relate to and share with each other. They are timeless. And i wish i could thank Jim personally for allowing me to share my own childhood with my niece and nephew. /v This is good for what is happening in Florida. (If you don't know it's hurricane Irma) #Prayforflorida /v We were there too it was awesome!!  /v That's amazing! Thought we lost him  /v Do you have the one where Kermit the Frog tap dancing to Happy Feet with Bobby Monihan? /v Great since of Nostalgia \nMatts kermit is closed enough to be jims and steves kermit if u listen closely , but i miss steve as kermit /v Who voiced Link Hogthrob in the Hollywood Bowl? /v WOW!!!!! Spectacular Kermit! /v This is amazing!!! /v Thank you so much for sharing this.  It makes my heart sing.  <3 /v I said a while ago I would decide how I felt about Matt when he sung the rainbow connection. Well now he has and I think he's great! /v Such an appropriate time to sing about the dreamers.... Great song! /v I saw the show on Sunday. It was a very cool experience. This marks the second time that I have seen Rainbow Connection performed live. (The first time was at the 2011 D23 Expo.) /v He kinda does sound like Jim. /v It was the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, not the Philharmoic. /v I am so psyched to actually see Paul Williams sing this song with the Muppets! :-) /v I'd like to take Jade to see the Muppet's could be one of those best days ever. I agree with Sailor Moon animgirl21 makes you feel like you want to meet them. /v Can we promote this video on the TV show The List - thelisttv.com ? We would give you verbal and graphical courtesy. Let me know, thanks! /v Wow. If this is the. New actor or old he does a goood job /v It's pigs in space now /v We were going to go to this but the tickets were way too expensive considering the fact that we'd be seated so far away /v My B kermit straight up auto tuned got me all the way fucked up /v It's like Jim Henson is back from the dead. /v Matt Vogel is really growing on me. /v Always Chills. Good Good Chills on many levels. /v Matt Vogel?\nNever heard of em /v Thank you for posting this /v I swear this is the only song they ever sing /v This makes me well up with Nostalgia. I love the Muppets so much and I'm so glad that they're still around :') /v which muppet characters do you see /v Why am i crying /v Congress meets Fraggle rock.. /v Wake up ! /v Cuite /v muy lindo /v luv /v My boi Kermit /v Show\nmuppets\n31minutos APLAPLAC /v I saw this tonight, Sunday. It was a great show, this number made me cry. It reminded me of years ago when my Mom was alive. /v When he sang I immediately thought of the family guy episode where a guy pulls up in a boat and Kermit pulls a shotgun on him /v Always this feeling that Constantine is impersonating Kermit ... Also too much prerecorded video sketches and music. /v His voice is not high enough booo /v I'm sorry, but Kermit's new voice sounds too much like Constantine's impression of him. /v Kermit's new voice is terrible. I understand why they fired Steve Whitmire, but I think they should hire him back. /v Matt Vogel sounds like Goofy doing a Kermit impression. And don't tell me he sounds like Jim cause he does not. This voice is deeper and has more of a southern twang. And I am not hating Steve never sound like Jim either. /v Omgghhhhhh that doesn't sound like kermie. Ewww Steve why did you do this to us! /v You have this while Disney is doing terrible reboots /v His voice is to gurgle-ie /v Never thought that one day Constantine would take Kermit`s place ! /v Muppets haven't been watchable since Jim passed /v *i cri* /v The fact that the voice of constatine is now the voice of kermit boggles my mind. And I don't like it. /v #NotmyKermit  /v You guys... this has to be so hard for Steve to see. I miss his performance of Kermit. He put a lot of personality into that puppet. /v The muppets died with Jim. Let them die Disney please and quit using them to make money and push liberal agendas this is cancer /v You're telling me they could professionally videotape The Muppet Show Live! From Muppetfest, yet they couldn't do the same thing for this and upload all of it to YouTube?! /v I wish they had gotten the guy that's currently doing Kermit. It's clear this is actually the guy who's currently doing Ernie on Sesame Street. /v So is Sesame Street dead now that HBO has it? I don't even know. /v genial necesitamos ms eso q violencia e intolerancia en el ftbol argentino, felicitaciones Sacachispas /v que lindo es ver esto en un futbol tan violento como el nuestro /v Lstima que perdieron la guerra :v /v JAJA QUE GLADIADORES QUE LINDO QUE SE DIVIERTAN Y SOBRE TODO QUE ESTEN UNIDOS Y AU AU AU AU /v los amo. /v genios /v Soy hincha de Sarmiento y dejo los riones por mi equipo... pero estos tipos de Sacachispas son unos MAESTROS.

Actually one of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen. The night time of the universe was truly awe inspiring. Makes one realize truly how small we are; a good thing to remember when one has problems they feel are overwhelming. Take ten minutes to watch this and it puts life and its problems and situations quickly in their proper order. Meaning not that important at all. My wife and I love your videos. Thank you for sharing them with us. You do an excellent job and editing is wonderful. Steve Lochmiller from Sacramento area of California. /v This type of videos are amazing!! /v WOW thats AMAZING\n\n\nthats a very nice HARD WORK /v Utube filled so many depressing and disturbing videos.... Loved this...Thanxx 4 getting up at 4am to capture those beautiful sunrises... I seriously wanna get into the details of ur work and knw more abt this video.. Like ur cameras/the seaexpedition/how u go into tat cargo ship... Evrything i wanna know frm scratch.... Not bcauz i wanna take pics/videos BUT EMBARK ON TAT JOURNEY... This my biggest dream..#SeaFarer...and there is a huge person relation of mine with this beautiful mystic miraculous mesmerizing sea... Inshort itz like this: Unlike mine and my father's generation my ancestors are true fishermen and sea farers... By birth and growth i belong to fishermen Jati...but vth modernity and development creeping in... I can no longer associate to tat Identity of my ancestors vhr my father works in an insurance sector and i one foot in academics and the other carving my own path of career...  All tat remains is jus to fascinate abt it... But still my ancestor's blood flows in me and no wonder i just love those moments vhn i take a walk on those sandy beaches of the ocean / rocky terrains of river beds/ lakebeds.... That sight at those pristine waters in its all blue... Tat gushing moisturised wind bathing my face and blowing my hair...JUST LOVE TAT...even now i stare at tat vision vth the wonder and curiosity of a child... Its like i am completely zapped by tat moment... Only on these occasions i love for the person i am and thngs i do...as i feel tat nothingness vhn i face a sea and tat innocence of a child like creeps into me... Those waves of water itz just like purging me.. The rest of the time i jus shun thyself...  So i immensely love boat rides... Seas.. Oceans...as of now my love and passion for this is only allowed and encouraged to those tiny 15-20mins boat rides/long walks near the lakes... But vhn my responsibilities r ovr...SeaFaring is all i yearn.... Awww man luk at those thousands of stars and tat beautiful play of colours on the night sky and tat music of water waves... Those highs and lows of the waves approaching the ship... The carefree drifting clouds... Those gentle/rough winds... Those rainwaters... And tat eternal like silence.... My existence is reduced to a tiny speck of dot in front of this beautiful creation... I feel so little and humbled... Wish ppl around me understand this /v That was stunning. Not often you see something from a totally new perspective. Well done. I thought it would be very cool to see a video like this from the prow of the ship too - as if you were flying across the ocean :) /v The most beautiful video i ever seen, thank you. /v how do you keep your camera on for 30 days? and what kind of memory card do u use? /v Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for all the effort it took to put this together and share it with the world, I appreciate it! /v This is a truly awesome video!

Thank you for making and sharing this. /v This is probably the best video i have ever seen, thanks for compiling such a great video simply beautiful /v Beautiful. How much does a captain of these ships typically get paid? That's a long  trip /v This is so stunning! Makes me fall in love with the world again!  /v Technically impressive. Superb! And very informative too. /v This is the greatest use of Timelapse I've ever seen. Outstanding project. /v Is the sky real ??? /v This is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Thanks for sharing  /v Great video, I just wished we could watch it in it's purity without the subtitles of what's what. /v It is truly beautiful. /v Truly awe inspiring. This is why YouTube exists: to show your world to others. Think of the millions of other shipping containers working their way around the world now.\n\nAre the straps on the bottom containers used to anchor them to the deck? /v Amazing! 4:40 and 8:13 I want to witness that everyday in my life. I miss my own amazing sky. Uplifting timelapse /v This is the best video on the internet. Thank you for it. Is there anyway I can get the full video without the text so I can turn it into a screen saver? /v I've never seen anything that so completely filled me with such wonder and awe and joy! Well done! /v Did you found the one piece? /v Truly awesome experience, something I think a lot of folks would enjoy.  I spent quite a few years working in Freight Forwarding, it was nice to see a full ship voyage, thanks for making this video. /v Just for your channel mate, and as a person who has always been fascinated by ships in general, I really enjoy your content. But I have one question, you think it would be possible to get a pic of the deck plans of the ship? I got this game where I build stuff in (Minecraft if you know about it ) and I've done quite a lot of ships in the past, so it would be so cool to see the layout of all the rooms and such in the ship :) /v This is amazing. I want to see it in theaters. Music, photos, captioning was all so fluid and I find it hard to critique. I feel small and impressed. Great job, Jeff. /v Amazing.. Spectacular !! This is so relaxing.. great choice of background score as well. Truly Awesome work. Keep it up man !! /v This video is so amazing I even forgot how to blink) so cool /v wonderful  it be better if 360 video /v The best video on internet today...amazing  /v stunning!

I know what it takes to put something like this together and I appreciate it the more for it. /v Probably my favorite video in all of the interwebs.  Well done.  So cool to see life from such an interesting perspective. /v Amazing.  Your videos are so eye opening to the world that is out there. /v This is totally amazing.....great work here /v OK, now I want to be a merchant marine. /v Incredible. I haven't been this captivated by a video or movie or piece of art in a long long time /v I'm just wondering who the 192 a-holes who down voted this video are?  Amazing piece of work.  Thank you so much for sharing! /v Very good work! \nThoroughly enjoyed watching it on a large 4K screen. /v Watching this while listening to riders of the storm by the doors is quite mindblowing /v Wow the colors are spectacular and all natural! /v Holy Crap this was awe inspiring loved this, it was so relaxing. Would love if you captured more. /v That is just stunning!  I've watched it 3 times back to back already.  Do you have a blog post or soemthing where you go in greater details on how you did this?  Curious on delay between shots, how you managed to feed power to the camera, etc etc etc.  In any case, amazing idea and edition.  LOVED IT! :) /v One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen! Just amazing wow /v Wow! This is fantastic! What a great documentary! /v I don't usually get erection from watching videos on YouTube, but i just did. Bravo! /v By the constantly distracting captioning and brand mark, no one is truly watching the video, it made me shut off an otherwise intriguing video, seriously, have u ever heard the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Let me experience it without a bunch of distracting BS! Does anyone get it anymore? /v That's a lot of water. /v ThE eArTh Is FlAt /v I am speechless. This was fascinating, awesome and yet sobering at the same time. The beauty of the ocean is awesome The loneliness of the long days at sea is sobering. That is one of the best YouTube videos I have seen in years. It does make you feel a bit small and insignificant when you put the world's oceans in perspective. I think this helps people understand the vastness of the water on this plant. I am afraid that people forget about the importance of the oceans until they make the news. On the other hand people will say there is so much ocean why should we be concerned. The night shots were beautiful. I would find myself standing out at night craning my neck to watch the universe go by. \n\nThough I have to say one of the thoughts that kept coming to mind was:  does it get lonely being out at sea for so long? What is the longest you have spent at sea during one stretch? How do you keep busy when not on shift? One stupid question does the ship ever become empty of containers? I actually have about a thousand other questions but that will do for now. Last thing please post more this was wonderful. I have watched it three times so far. /v breathtaking ..thank you so much for sharing !! /v Ouahou ! Very nice video, wonderful ! I like it very much and it's interesting. Thanks for that. /v That is one of the most awesome and fantastic videos I've ever seen! thank you a lot for this! /v Well done.  Great chance for those of us who don't venture out on the seas what that experience is like. (My Dad was in the Navy so I really enjoyed this). /v Great idea, and a beautiful video ! /v Really cool! The notes you included in the video were helpful as well. How much memory did it take for the full timelapse? /v Fantastic timelapse man! Love the way the light transitions between day and night! /v This is stunning and makes me homesick for the sea.... /v Love your channel in specific really admire this video. Makes me want to Work on a ship. /v I have no words to describe the beauty of this video.  /v Dude, can you please issue this video without the subtitles? /v You should do a tutorial on how u did this I'm interested to see what setting u used /v Nothing left to say, but awesome.

Thanks. /v love this video <3 /v God is great /v Omg highlighter brows /v Shading Kim ? /v Ew. /v Love , love you !! /v MISS /v El transmite desde ultraTumba? /v Black girl magic baby!!!  /v Omggggg I need it alll /v I think Jeffree Star became pretty after applying fenty /v Racist Cunt /v Every make up Jeffree wear are amazinggggg /v The highlighter is  /v love the hair /v Someone explain me his eyebrows /v Chest highlight looks like Edward Cullen! /v ne konuuyo be susmad /v WTF S THIS /v The audacity /v Wooooow ur freaky /v Omg u are my idol!!!!! /v Yes ! /v  /v Where are his eyebrows /v What are some good lip gloss dupes for Rihanna's universal lip gloss? /v This is the reason I stopped watching YT . . . /v Wow you are fast as lightning! I just found out yesterday about her new line and read about the story on how there weren't enough different shades to suit skin of color or different varieties. Glad I watched your video! to get a better idea on if it's worth the splurge. /v You are in front of a Picasso! /v A racist reviewing a black woman's makeup line? Hmmmmmnnnn. OK. Commence the usual hypocrisy and dick riding. /v This is the review I was waiting for. lol /v i know makeup has no rules but omfg that gold highlight is not for fair skin it is a lot more for poc!!! /v That girl on his neck is so lucky!  /v i realy want to try this stuff but in my country we can not find any thing  /v The collection is beautiful /v I know you probably get a lot of messages but Morphe is selling your products off their website and I was wondering if they're actually authentic and you gave them permission to sell them. /v Anyone I need all the prayers I can get please and Thankyou /v How didn't he love the gloss?!?! I looooooove it so much it's so gorgerous  /v Ah jeffree, congrats I thought for sure you died. /v Classic case, want to call us niggers and buy up our shit lmao foh boi /v I love the way he talks /v Are they cruelty free? If so, im gonna try them foundations!  /v Why when he said here from New York city at the end I shouted IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!! /v Wtf is he talking that primer is little high tf he really needs to stfu like Mark Jacob primer and make up line primer is higher than that /v Just when I thought it was going to be easy to save my money Rihanna goes and launches a bunch of make up whyyyy /v he threw shade to the kardashian/Jenner clan lol /v I love you jefree ! Watch your videos always ! Love the review ! Your so real and your taste in quality and makeup is amazing  /v It's just the name, that's all... /v look so amazing  subscribe me guys for video  /v Brand by a black woman ? Seems legit /v Your skin looks as smooth as butter. You matched your color perfectly. Her line is definitely going to be around for years to come. /v The highlight is everything  trophy wife omllll /v I love you Jeffree  you are my fav guru! /v It is really bothering me that he has a drink sitting on his laptop next to the bed /v Because you know I wanna look as plastic and fake as possible ily  /v so disappointed he called  black people niggars no more support form me your a  fuck u with ur KKK ass /v The gold highlight would look so sexy on someone with epic shoulders and shoulder blades as a body highlight /v I'm loving the brushes! I don't wear foundation. Love the highlighter. Like the lipgloss... /v You shouldn't even be able to fucking review this /v Haha you are so dope babe now I gotta go get some products cuz you looked gorgeous in them  /v I remembered Jeffree being like at least three shades lighter... I guess he's got a tan but I still don't feel like that shade of foundation matches his actual skin tone /v The title hit or miss  that shouldn't even be in Discussion it's a hittttt /v any chance you could review Bella Pierre \nI would love to find more information about it , from the one and only.\nespecially to see if its worth the price tag.\n xoxo /v First time I've ever watched a video of him. Made me want to die more than I already did /v You look so beautiful and classy with your hair! I love your craziness  /v Can I just say where the fuck are his brows  /v man that highlight brush is something else /v I think the gloss, was flippin amazing! It's hard get  a hue easily in gloss instead of an actually shade...translucent with sheer color, loved it! /v Someone as racist as him doesn't deserve to use makeup by riri and her black girl magic  /v I want someone to love me like Jeffree loves highlighting. /v I really don't see the big deal I'm just sayin /v But can we talk about your hair. Looks so good. /v That foundation looked AMAZING! It definitely looked like it set on its own which is amazing for clients who don't want to wear powder. The only thing that scares me about the GLASS packaging is that as a TRAVELING Makeup Artist, some of those products might break. I learned my lesson from some of the Nars foundations. /v for a second, i thought the background music was bst, mianhae /v Please make up of Tyra banks /v It looks dark and orangish. Really oxidized to me. I hate oxidation! Not a detractor or fan of Rhianna but I love anyone who works this hard to fulfill the major hole that most makeup companies ignore. That is finding a foundation for women of color!! So happy for my girls who can now check out some colors that can work for them without having to use a bunch of darkeners to ensure a color match! About time! /v You looked like an oompa loompa at the end of the video. I think it oxidized A LOT. 2 shades lighter is the way to go i think. /v BULLSHIT talm bout how you're not about no lightweight packaging.. you sure did love Kim K's ziplock baggie /v I don't know why I fell that Jeffrey is keeping coments because he is like kinda involved in to the line , because he is not acting like always , I don't know , let me now if I'm not the only one /v I OWN GLOSS ITSSS STUNNING /v pls....pls do your eyebrows /v Amazing!!!! /v He Talks Like Joey Graceffa /v Fuck you bitch! /v  /v When he mentioned Women Of Color , I don't care what ANYONE says i still love Jeffree /v I screamed when he put on Trophy Wife! Brb gotta go order it asap! It's so beautiful  /v Jeffree is the level of rich I'm trying to be /v Fenty is has hands down worlds best highlighter so far /v U have all of them? /v Y'all need to invite a poor person like me to these premiers So my broke ass... can get some free stuff..... /v Rihanna is really going off right now! She did the damn thing ....   I am so proud of her!!! /v Yasss. I think the metal moon looks better on fair, tan and pale skin and I think trophy wife look better on brown/black skin  I love it tho /v Omg I saw James Charles review ( I love him) but Jeffree did a WAYYYY better review . Nothing seemed to work correctly on James /v Jeffree should do a full makeup look on one of his face tattoos  /v I feel like that foundation color doesn't match... /v Ew paece un cedo jaja /v Fkn racist gay bitch /v ORGANIC / NATURAL MAKEUP REVIEW ( WHOLEFOODS!!!!) /v This made me happy for a minute. I just lost my home due to Irma in Florida. My kids and I are homeless right now. Thank you for getting my mind off of this for a few minutes  /v Can we just take a second to admire his cheek bones and the fact that he has NO FUCKING PORES /v Jeffreestar: Lets test it with the flashlight\nMe:(blind) /v You can't fool me with all you're techno jargon.  It's witchcraft plain and simple! /v Nice Youtube. I've been thinking for a long time that microwave could be used for speaker feedback. This would work with just a comparator. I haven't been able to build it, not my field, but nice to know something like this exists. /v Step 1: Draw some eldritch symbols on the copper layer of a pcb.\nStep 2: Put some components randomly on that pcb.\nStep 3: Make an offering to the microwave god.\nStep 4: Profit! /v Physics is very interesting subject indeed! your videos have quality and my best wishes for the channel to have million subscribers. /v Great video Kerry. Assuming it can tune below 10.5 Ghz I see the foundation for an amateur transceiver. /v Thank you for sharing Kerry, very interesting. I know nothing about this subject, now I want to know more. Best regards, Joel /v Kerry, fantastic. I love it. I know nothing of this field. You lifted the curtain enough that I have vocabulary to learn more. Many thanks. /v Hate crime, racism, anti-Semitism and misogyny.....all you needed was xenophobia or islamophobia and you would have had Feminist Bingo....better luck next time guys. /v Buttom line... Stephen King can be pretty fucked up to put it mildly. /v So basically Penywise is just an excuse for Stephen King to write a book about child sex and gore? I'm... starting to think maybe this guy isn't someone I should respect. \nWhatever a writer writes about, the subject matter can be inspired, but ultimately the content of the book is a revealing insight into the mind of the writer... Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers. A hell of a lot more than we would think is probably the answer. /v Now do the mini-series VS the movie. xD /v Really interested if you all are going to look at the 2017 not-John-Hughes IT. /v Why do the Beverley in the 2017 vers. have sex with all the boys in the group? That's so DISGUSTING AND VILE that a image of pre-teen GANGBANG just conjured up in my mind. Did the reviewers said they all had sex in the sewers? That just made it WORSE for me now. I gotta to get this out my mind, probably going to watch the original movie again. /v good intentions\nbut seems a bit dumbed down... /v Due to budgetissuesthey had to leave to letters out of the title. /v They did mike hanlon so bogus in the new movie /v Would you like it in alphabetical order???? /v Who is this chick? Fuck she ruins what was going to be an incredible episode. I genuinely can't tell if she's trying to do a Pennywise high-pitched clown voice for comedic purposes or if that's her actual voice. Either way, she's got a voice for modeling. /v Seeing the old clips it seems they even brought back the odd lip-syncing for Pennywise, as if the lines were added later. Dunno if that's supposed to be intentional for both movies since It's a cosmic horror, but... /v So the only female in the club in the book is a slut. I mean sure the sex orgy was a bonding ritual, but essentially the girl banged more than one boy. Worse in one sequence: one after the other. How did she not get pregnant? /v IT is not a demon, but a cosmic being or eldritch abomination like Cthulhu or Gozer from Ghostbusters. /v CAN YOU PLZ DO A HOMEMADE IT TRAILER!? /v Did you legit just say Steven and not Stephen? /v Wanna fix a problem? Have sex with all of your friends! That's a good idea... right? /v WAHA WAHA /v METAPHOR......SURE! /v  /v American psycho /v Please do I Know What You Did Last Summer the book is not even a slasher like the movie and they're remaking it although the director said he won't be making something closer to the book it's going to be all new so my question is why? /v the dead kid and the picture of Georgie is pretty much like this in the book. The 85 murders begin and then as Mike builds up the evidence to be sure to call his paws one of the things that makes him certain that it's It they are dealing with is the picture of Georgie that disappeared in 58 after it winked at bill /v I have never seen a Youtube channel that has more bots spamming it that CineFix. /v Here's a fun fact:  The kid playing young Richie is Seth Green, known for his voice acting on Robot Chicken.  So voices are his game now. /v I don't remember Stan brutally chopping himself up in the book.  It's been about five years since I read the book.  Anybody want to fill me in on what happened if I'm wrong? /v I wish they kept the them running a train part from the books in the new adaption. /v Fucking hell, what an annoying ass video. Those narrator/ presenters are awful. /v 13:01 HAHAHAHAHA WTF?? I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PART AND IM GLAD I DID NOW /v With the notable exception of Carrie the only really good adaptations of Stephen King's novels are the non-supernatural ones. /v Based on the mini series, IT's powers seem to be based in subjective or perceived reality. The silver works because they know it works, the asthma inhaler works when they are kids when he thinks it's acid, then as an adult when he knows its mostly water it doesn't work.\n\nA similar system was actively used by the citizens of Elm St in Freddy vs. Jason. The people suppressed all knowledge of Freddy and his killings and eventually that stripped him of his powers. I don't know if it was an intentional reference to IT though. /v I like the miniseries. It's cheesy but charming and Mike's arc isn't given to a white character. The woman talking sounds like she has a bubble in her throat but good video /v I know a lot of people keep saying Bev was gangbanged in the book but that is just not true.....\nshe had a train ran on her.. /v I don't remember the spider part /v Something, something, kid gang bang, something, something, bad.   Now give me your likes! Everyone else is doing it. /v 9:33 are we gonna ignore the fact that Stephen King as a grown man made a decision to include a group a 12 year olds running a train on another 12 year old girl even though he could've written literally anything else in the story to symbolize that they loved each other /v Best Pennywise line - \n\nKiss me fat boy! /v Adultery/underage fornication/ the disgusting etc isn't loving.. who taught these kids? Satan? /v What's the plural of medium? /v Being scared of clowns is actually a pretty new fear. From about the 2000s and mostly in the US. /v 10:10 *what can Stephen King cut with a 1,000 degree knife?!?!?1!?1?!?!!?1?!?* /v Correction: It were THREE bullies that were involved with throwing the homosexual man over the bridge. /v ...And this is why I've never felt inclined to pick up one of his novels. Yeah, they're LONG books... but people don't read books just to say they've carried around a giant weight with words inside and looked at them all. The book trailer or little blurb won't win you over unless you are a die-hard horror fan, maybe. When it comes to what you hear about them outside of that? They sound dull, gross, and pretentious at the same time. I don't see the appeal. /v 9:47 Wasn't it Bill who initiated this? /v tim is the only reason this thing was scary /v I understand that Stephen King is supposed to be a genius and all but you have to be a really sick fuck to write about children fucking each other /v Tip; drop all the dumb leftie crap like 'm-muh racial insensitivity' and similar. /v The difference to me.... The first was awesome with great acting. The second was lame, not scary at all & Pennywise wasn't half the clown Tim Curry was. Why choose a pretty boy to play what was suppose to be such a scary part? IT from the 90s wins, hands down! Very disappointed in this new one. /v pennywise isn't a demon, he is  a sickness brought on by the breaking of the beams and the assault on the dark tower by the Crimson King /v I liked the older one more.\nJust seemed like the story was easier to follow. /v You say **ripped his arm off** yet you show us ripping his hand off... /v She had sex with everyone in the losers club wtf Steven King wtf... /v He should have said quit clowning around and then slammed the book on its hand killing all the scary. /v oh for the love of, stop fearing clowns, it's the people behind the make-up the ones you should be afraid of. /v Ya'll barking up da wrong tree\n\ndis clown man isn't bad\nhe is not racist\nhe is not homophobic\nhe only just hungry n homeless\nhe is an illegal alien but don let the mf trump know\n\nfuck ya'll niggas hatin' on a poor and homeless clown man, racist ass mfs, u should be ashamed of yaseolf /v GUYS IM TELLING YOU THAT IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE NEW MOVIE YOU HAVE TO I HATE CLOWNS BUT THE MOVIE WAS AWESOME IT WAS BETTER THEN DEADPOOL AND SPIDER MAN HOMECOMING AND THOSE MOVIES WERE AWESOME BUT DEADPOOL TWO MIGHT BE BETTER  /v Why no comparison to the new movie? /v I never understood the book when they just all gang banged her out of nowhere...then blood brothers? Pretty sure she  just wants to spread HIV+. Child pornography writing at its finest...gj Stephen. /v THOT alert. Please evacuate to your nearest thot shelter. Remain calm and move in an ordely fashion. The anti-thot association will remove her presence. /v Do a diy IT costume!! /v My friends and I ran a train on a girl too, the only difference one of us got her pregnant  /v I'm pretty sure Pennywise is the Crimson King, or have I got that wrong? /v I don't get King's idea of having a orgy be some way to make the group come together. If anything, it just means she is the one that keeps their love bind together. So if she dies, there's no bind that keeps them together. /v One of the hugest elements of the novel that was left out of the mini-series was the creepy abandoned house on the dead end street where the kids encounter maybe the most over the top psychological and metaphysical horror of the whole novel. This segment of the book is totally left out that's too bad because I've always considered it maybe the creepiest portion of the novel. In conclusion, the novel is simply so massive in its scope and unrelenting horror nastiness that it will never be successfully adapted to film. /v if you folks doing film blade runner and the novel 1968 do androids dream of electric sheep next use the 2009-2011 comic book by boom studios it's based on the novel it contains the full complete text of the novel illustrated by tony parker. /v Damn it i want to reread the book and watch the tv mini serise again...the new films great btw just as funny as the mini serise /v Do IT 2017 homemade trailer /v The Langoliers than? Please!!!!! /v #clownlivesmatter /v I miss cassy redmen /v that little girl fucked the entire loosers club, WHAT THE HELL stephen king XD /v Just watched the 1990 IT least night (had it on DVD for 10+ years but wasn't interested). I totally interpreted the girl as having screwed all the guys from the loser club. I even figured they may have taken her one after the other. NO idea how I correctly guessed that. Trophy of Awesome goes to me. /v wtf stephen king is a closet pedo like wow \n\nwhat a fucking weirdo \n\nI just turned into a Trump voter /v The original one is not even the slightest bit scary. /v Do a diy costume for 2017 it /v I have to commend you for not throwing a fit that the miniseries couldn't include everything in the book. You are right when you say its basically a faithful adaptation, and stuff was cut either for time, a broader audience, or creative decisions. People today expect an adaptation to CLING to the source material which shouldn't be the norm. Great video. /v The new IT is awesome /v Actually you guys are wrong. A girl did get murdered and grown up Mike Hanlon did found a picture of Georgie near the crime scene. The picture has been missing since Bill and Richie went back to check Georgie's moving and winking picture. Finding this photo is in fact the deciding factor for Mike to believe that IT did returned and called up the others. This is quite important in the book and the picture had driven a lot of flash back so I don't know how you could have missed it if you did read the book. /v See the Turtle of enormous girth!\nOn his shell he holds the earth.\nHis thought is slow but always kind; \nhe holds us all within his mind\n\n-Stephen King in Song of Susannah /v Clowns are not scary /v Extended Sceneshttps://youtu.be/1Xtkkb8Hfw8 /v Forrest Gump? /v Kiss meh *FAT BOI* /v Fuck fucking clowns man, and just to reiterate, we're not reading a script. /v You know how to make clowns relevant again ? Electric guitars. /v Do 2010: Odyssey Two!!!! /v MOVIE is better /v https://youtu.be/KwhHw-8h5GE /v wtf is steven kings books /v stephen king is an sjw lmao /v Mysogony? 3 minutes for you twats to toally trigger me... /v Georgie not george /v 13:02 Kiss me fat boy!  /v My pussy love a clown in version 2017. /v Welp, Stephen king was a filthy liberal degenerate that enjoys writing pages about under age children having sex or checking their breasts...... /v I havent seen the original IT because I cant watch it anywhere. Well, I can but its illegal. /v DO DEATHNOTE NEXT!     ANIME VS MANGA /v Everyone is like child orgy is bad and I'm just sitting here going... Back in my day, 12 year olds were blowing each other on the school bus (when i was 12). It was a major problem. Is it still? /v I have yet to see the new version, but is the underage sex scene in there? Please tell me it's in there! It's gotta be in there! /v Big misconception that the miniseries also takes place in 1958. As with the current film it was moved forward a bit, though not as drastically. Book is 1958 - 1985 and the miniseries is 1960 - 1990. /v Murica /v I remember hearing this on the original L & O as well...thank you for posting this. /v Is there an episode for this? /v Recommendations for future videos/projects: 1. Explain and illustrate how compounds without gaseous products can explode (eg. Cu2C2, other metal acetylides), or 2. Find a method of removing denatonium benzoate (bitrex) from denatured alcohol (to really get the government on your door!) /v Damn! Look at the view count! That's 5 times more than usual! /v what we learned:\nyou can make anything from anything else /v YOU DID IT! YOU ARE THE ONE WHO KNOCKS! /v Since you said making it from domestically available chemicals makes about as much sense as making computers from sand, I think that would be a great project for someone to do and document in a video series. /v Amazing thank you :) for entertaining and educating us /v Sell it to the banana republics and earn a fortune;) /v If you want to do a big project, think about what is party need ^o^ /v Amazing result! Cheers! /v Personally i think you should have a larger project ongoing interspersed with smaller simpler things. /v so at the end of the day, is it easier to take an advance chemist course or just to buy the stuff? /v Nurd the acetone peak I bet is from your lab connection person cleaning the NMR tubes with acetone. Here in my lab we clean them with water then acetone then stick them in the oven. It's not uncommon for a little bit of acetone to be left over in the NMR spectrum /v Congratulations!!!  What an accomplishment.  It's been very fun to watch. /v What a random thing to make. I guess it emphasizes your goal to make anything from anything. /v so loong way just for Pyrimethamine\ngreat effort you did there /v THAT'S JUST COOL, In an apocalyptic setting chemist will be kings any one who can make aspirin from some bark is soooo going to be rolling in bottle caps!!\n\nACTUALLY, can you make Asprin? like if your in a none ideal environment like a juried lap I mean nothing that would risk your safety or anything but If your in a post apocalyptic setting making basic medicines would be a huge advantage. /v been watching this process the entire 2 years youve been working on it. and im no chemist. to be honest i barely follow the names of the chems you use to do this, but its satisfying to see the reactions. congrats from a regular joe man. you blew my mind on this one. /v Heres an idea. Platytoxin. Suppose to be a very hard chemical to sythansize :) /v Fuck yes! Congratulations man!! Been a great journey watching this. Am so pleased it finally paid off!! /v Well done! I haven't been here for the whole process as a lot of organic reactions are a bit too complex for an amateur-amateur like me.\nBut anyone can see it's worth celebrating when you come out of two years research with a big green tick in the checkbox.\nKeep up the great work... you are the one person who made me realise that YouTube wan't just about pirated music videos and people hiding turds in each others lunchboxes. /v Wow , has it really been two years ? Time flys. Next project ? LSD from domestically availability chemicals /v One of the great youtubers of this time. /v I absolutely loved this series. Semi-complex organic chemistry is fun to watch. Plus the added benefit of thinking about making medications in a dire scenario. /v $22K on a single video series! I admire the dedication, I largely gave up making videos after $2k in return-less investment on YouTube. /v Congrats on the success! I have to echo sediment here. Get this thing published, if only to thumb your nose at Pharma. That and the sodium metal discovery.\n\nNow, for future projects, why not something a little more light-hearted? It be awesome to see you come up with some experiments that are for kids, or can be done by kids. Get the next generation excited about science! /v That's all you have to do?! simple /v looks like you could build amphetamine from this molecule. is that possible? /v Genuinely impressive, you've made me appreciate and enjoy learning (Attempt to understand ) chemistry in a way my teachers never did :) /v WIsh you could show how to make alprazolam lol it would help me a lot /v Congratulations!  I enjoyed the series. /v Well done sir. A legend among chemists has just arisen. /v I would only inject Pyrimethamine made by Turing Pharmaceuticals into my eyeballs. /v It would be really interesting to see you separate the specific alkaloids of nightshade plants. /v What about synthesis of Ambazone or Indolylacetic acid? /v Just swing for the fences and try and decipher what the hell starlite was /v I've followed and wached every step in your pyrimethamine synthesis with all the struggels and set backs. It is awesome you've finally synthesized pyrimethamine  from household chemicals!! Thanks for not giving up and continuing this project great work!! I hope you've enjoyed the road to this succes! /v Amazing! Congratulations, it's been fun seeing this progress over the last 2 years! /v 9:40 it can be product of oxidasing of methanol. /v Congratulations! Also, I want that map on a shirt. /v Fucking hell man. Amazing job.  I'm so glad I found your channel years ago so I could follow along on the ride /v Thanks for the series! I don't understand much of the formulas you present but it has been intriguing for me to watch the progress. Could you shed a light (on another video?) how these chemical formulas are formed i.e when you mix something, how do you know what will happen and what will be the result and how to write the reaction to paper? /v can you try and make acetaminophen /v I would like to see a commentary about the whole process and where things failed or where things can be done better. Things that where fun and things that where a wee bit crazy. /v Could you please do a grignard Reaction for one of your next videos ? /v This is so cool, congratulations. It's really cool that the public can now watch a graduate level research project from start finish. Hopefully you open peoples eyes :) /v CONGRATS!!!!! Well done, and I look forward to more videos!! /v Martin Shkreli came to dislike the video 41 times /v Holy crap, you did it man!\n\nTwo years, and you refused to give up; that is very admirable.\n\nHuuuuge congrats! /v For some reason I didn't get my videos from you flagged /v that is an insane price @_@!!!! /v Do you think a foam metal pellet inside a pressurized tube could be saturated with liquid oxygen?  Like a sponge... /v H E I S E N B E R G  /v Congratulations!  You made it! /v I bet you could make some straight fire crack, honky. You are wasting your talents. /v Congratulations on job well done! I understand very little about chemistry, but I do like to learn more every day. Thank you for reminding me (us) that failure is part of the process and the journey is the reason to go anywhere. /v Congats and hats off to you!\n\nIt's been long while, and amazing series. \n\nI wonder if theres something that used to be commonly made but not anymore that you could reproduce using modern chemistry. Like say certain plastics? /v I've waited so long for this, thank you so much for working so hard on it. /v Bravo!!!!! \n\nWhere there's a will there is a way!!!  Big up's to all the home scientist!!! /v Congratulations Dr. Lithium on your success with a very long multi step convergent organic synthesis. Organic synthesis at the amateur level is very difficult given everything has to be made from scratch. \n\nI look forward to seeing your next research endeavor. :D Maybe going back and revisiting one of the topics you showed us when working at your previous lab like dye-sensitized solar cells? ;) /v In description\nThis video is generously sponsored by:\n\nGary Johnson\n*WAIT WHAT?!* /v Silly NurdRage. Big Pharma doesn't price medication against cost to manufacture.\nThey're all about treating us, not curing, so we buy more PILLS.\nI'm only razzin' you. Great job! /v Hey NurdRage, I would like to make manganese metal from thermite, but I would like to to use zinc metal instead of aluminum powder because you have a video on how to make zinc powder, and manganese dioxide from the video about getting it from batteries. I was wondering if this was even remotely possible or not at all. If it is you could try it and add it as a video for your thermite reactions. \n\nP.S. I love your videos they are very inspiring for me. /v This shit better be trending by the time I get back here. /v if I ever get malaria I'll give you a call..lol nice work. /v Next time what you could do when you screw up or get stuck on a step would be to order the chemical and go on to the next step and then go back and fill in the missing steps. I have been following this for the whole time and wish I could see all the failures. I am a chem student and would be interesting. I know that most people aren't chem majors but hey thats why we have youtube where we can see really specific content and don't have to worry about things being dumbed down so the average idiot who is afraid of math can understand. Thanks for the inspiration I plan on doing similar things with my new found knowledge. /v can you please make the whole procedure as one video, it will be interesting to see, even if over 1 hour /v Congratulations! You have earned it. \n\nAlso I just signed up for your patreon. /v Well done!  In my opinion, it's been worth all the effort you've put in.  I've watched each video from start to finish & have enjoyed it all.  Even though I haven't any background in chemistry - outside of high school - I'm still fascinated by it.  Keep up the great work! /v Congratulations for your achievements! You have been so inspiring to me that I have started to study chemistry in university :) Because chemicals here in EU regions are very controlled, it's hard to get anything like you have as a easily available domestic chemical and because of that, being amateur chemist in EU region is pretty hard. So it's nice to see real chemical syntheses and experimentations. /v *@NurdRage: You didn't do bad at all as far as price goes.* _According to Wikipedia: In the United States in 2015, Pyrimethamine was not available as a generic medication and the price was increased from 13.50 USD to 750 USD a tablet (75,000 USD for a course of treatment). In other areas of the world it is available as a generic and costs as little as 0.05 to 0.10 USD per dose._ *Something is seriously wrong, when your method described here is cheaper then it was in the US.* /v Congratulations, NurdRage! /v Make MDMA next. /v Your welcome /v Kudos!!! /v Congratulations NurdRage! You completed the pyrimethamine synthesis! /v good job bruh\n\nnow eat it ;) /v brilliant NR well done /v $22,000??? Holy shit! /v Congrats. /v Congrats NurdRage! /v Well done Dr. Lithium! /v VICTORY! /v Well done /v Congratulations! /v HOOAH /v Awesome congrats! /v What a journey! /v the true MVP /v well done sir /v Congratubrilliance! /v Congrats! What'll be next? /v Congratulations! /v rip /v It's doooooooooone!!!!! :D /v This video is unviewable in your country due to a copyright claim by Martin Shkreli. /v You can finally put this project to bed, well done man!\nSide-note: You might want to look at some interviews with Shkreli. I've personally done a 180 on the guy since you started this project, because his reasons for doing what he did are actually pretty legit. Daraprim is a terrible drug and he put all the revenue from it into new R&D for a replacement that wouldn't have so many side effects. /v Are you going to publish the sodium thing? /v Can someone explain why this is notable? \n\nThis drug isn't currently covered under a patent AFAIK, so have other companies (Besides Shkreli's) not made it themselves because they don't know how? Is the uploader the only person (other than people affiliated with Shkreli's company) to synthesize it?\n\nSomeone please explain. /v so on a danger diamond this would have 4s all around eh?? /v Made it here, cost me 2.7k US$. Will refine. TYVM /v Bannon is a hero. Not interested in watching the reporters gang up on their target 3 on 1 afterwards to create the illusion of majority opinion in the minds of the public they try to brainwash. Absolutely filthy behavior. Shame on you. /v that's messed up what CBS did to Bannon, they over saturated him to make him look bad, look at those red rings around his eyes. you can tell by the curtains. look at the curtains behind Bannon then look at the curtains behind the interviewer /v I'm voting for either President Trump or Mr. Steve Bannon in 2020 if he is going to run.  I strongly believe the educated Asian Americans like myself will do the same. /v Bannon is great. I hope he stays in touch with Trump /v Steve Bannon is a man, a real man. Fox hole loyalty and mentality is always saves the soldier fighting next to you. That's Steve Bannon and I would be proud and honored to have that kind of loyalty from a man like him. He's a true Patriot, knows what it takes to overcome obstacles. I am concerned for his safety though, we all know how the powers behind the scene hate giving it up, remember what happened to Andrew Breitbart, his very good friend and cohort. That's what cowards do, stab you in the back. /v worst thing about him is wearing 2 shirts. wtf? /v Bannon is the great and hope for our country. /v I've seen preschoolers come up with better excuses and better points than this....who is this guy? /v Another prime example of the master race.... /v Politicians fear the media, which viciously attacks and dishonestly smears candidates who don't do what the media wants them to do. Most politicians soften, back down, and appease. The American people have been watching this in anger for years. The media represents the interests of the globalist elite, not the interests of the American people. Trump fought back, and that's why the American people forgave him for a multitude of sins. /v Nice photoshop of Bannon .... CBS u corrupt Sodomites whos sons burn with lust for men /v He isnt being loyal to TrumF these guys are both Scumbags , he is just saying this so TrumF wont crush him . He is just going to get TrumF in the dark like the Weasel he is /v This guy looks plain evil but man, he's a great political strategist. /v George Clooney is a hypocrite.  Go Steve. /v The Access Hollywood tape did have one positive effect: it lead to the jettisoning of Chris Christie. /v I am not media and I am not even an American, but that locker room talk left an indent on my mind on how a US president view women. You can call it what ever you want, at the end of the day, that was a married man talking about groping a married women - yet some just want to dismiss it as nothing! That speaks volume about the character of a man at hand (Trump). /v Bannon is spot on. I'm so glad this guyband Trump are friends. /v People reflected back to what Clinton did to women! /v bannon people do care you stupid racist trump lost the popular vote and he is the most unpopular president in history he is one reason the electoral college  should go /v Its no wonder America & that whole WORLD want him DEAD...... /v I must say, I am disappointed. Though I am not surprised, he isn't any brighter than the idiot president. Demagogue, in the flesh. /v The more I hear this guy talk, the more I like him. I actually think it might help Trump and his agenda if he (Bannon) is on the outside calling it like it is. Time will tell. /v I heard he is slated to be the sexiest man alive 2018! /v Charlie Rose has aged, damn. Slurs words. Looks ready for a home, how sad. /v he sound he has accent. /v Bannon should be president, not Trump.\nJust being honest, don't hate me. /v So basically washington isn't a swamp, it's a cesspool! A city full of oath breaking traitors! /v This is the man who had our presidents ear? Seriously? Wow. /v Doubles down in shirts as well. /v Many of the things Steve says are exaggerations, armchair quarterbacking, or provably false. I do however agree with his assertion that China is in an economic war with the US while we sit back like idiots. /v What the establishment media keep trying to impress upon people is an emphasis on the idea of condoning groping women. What Bannon is focusing on is that in order to beat back the establishment, including those on the right/GOP, you have to not fall for the billy bush trap, you have to move forward and keep going. That in order to fix crisis you need not get buried in these assume the worst scenarios that do nothing but serve to defend the establishment through their media outlets pretending they care about anything but securing theirselves a position of power. And they'll use your social awareness as a weapon against anyone to achieve it when they could care less as long as the govt positions are secured. /v You can hate him but you gotta admire him. /v CBS just lost me with this evil deed of coloring Steve Bannon to look evil. This is horrible of 60 minutes we so trusted. Very dishonest. WHY?? /v Steve Bannon has balls.  And that scares the crap out of the professional politicians in the DC swamp and our mendacious mainstream media. /v Trump and Bannon are defending our great nation and its citizens from a system of corruption that goes well beyond evil.......the American political system has been planted with pedophile scumbag politicians who never were elected by the people but rather a fraudulent election system.... where voting equipment is hacked and Illegal aliens vote by the millions .... dead people vote by the millions....this to name a few aspects of an American election system gone totally left and corrupted to its core...created  to service and elect politicians that are willing to sell out our American values and heritage plus loot our great nation economically.....Obama was there super star .....elected by a fraudulent voting system and propped up by the fake news .......this scenario has been exposed .......Obama was a traitor and more over a terrorist !! We as Americans must now change the landscape in our election system.... root out deception and destroy the cancerous core that has produced so many false prophets in our great nation.........Thank you Steve Bannon and Donald Trump for exposing what many have died trying to expose for many decades.........We will make America Great Again and the Patriots are rising to this cause ..................In God We Trust and MAGA !!!\nShow less\nREPLY /v Overrated, unqualified, failed POS taking out his frustrations about himself with the world. Don't give this man a platform to voice his bloody nonsense. Did this piece of crap spawn? Disgusting with no moral bearings. Would sell his mother and daughter for his 15 min of fame. Wanted to look like a king maker but ended up being a failure. /v I like this guy. He looks really high. /v so he's Irish hahaha not even American lol. /v Bannon was right, because at the end of the day there's not a man or woman on the planet that can look back and honestly say that they haven't said something deeply inappropriate in private. Maybe Ned Flanders is off the hook, but that's about it. /v Hope you guys saw how Charlie Rose was very defensive in this /v Bannon must have learned a thing or two from Squealer (Orwell's Animal Farm). /v Why do I get this Dallas vibe from this man? He reminds me of someone that would go up against J.R. over oil lol /v Steve, Move to Whitefish for good ! /v This guy is really smart; that's why the Media hate him so much... /v Locker room talk. I mean he confessed to harassing someone. /v Still saying that was locker room talk...lol .i don't  think he was in a locker room /v Bannon really gets it. I wish he were still in the White House. /v YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE ABOUT THESE INTERVIEWS?  When they CUT THE SENTENCES AND FULL STATEMENTS to frame it the way the producers want you to see it.  You can CLEARLY SEE the EDITORS (if you are real news.....why edit my statements?) keep cutting Steve's sentences. /v Why does he look high? /v sounds like charlie rose is taking it personal. /v So glad the racial demographics are changing in the America. These white Christian terrorist need to go  /v I did not know much of Steve Bannon other than what the extremely left leaning liberal press had reported on him. That being said after watching this interview I love the guy. Keep up the good work Steve. I loved these quotes of his...Steve Bannon to Chris Christie - ...You're not on the plane you're not on the team, He didn't make the plane... Also ...I don't need to be lectured by a bunch of limousine liberals from the upper East Side and the Hamptons... A direct slap in the face to Charlie Rose and all the higher ups at CBS. Love it! What a pair of brass balls on this guy. /v Bannon has begun holding private meetings with insurgent challengers, vowing his support. Hes coordinating with conservative mega-donor ROBERT MERCER, who is prepared to pour millions of dollars into attacks on GOP incumbents. Bannon has also installed a confidant at an outside group that is expected to target Republican lawmakers and push the Trump agenda. The Mercer family is running the WH. /v Serious comment - does he have pink eye? /v *There's a side of Charlie Rose & David PacKman that's pure EVIL.* /v DemoKKKrats. /v Rose comes out smelling like a rose.. fertilizer. /v He's wearing a black suit jacket on top of a black button up on top of a black button up...why? /v Go away un-American Charlie Rose you belong in the swamp with Chuck and Mccain! /v This guy know how to handle the hysterical media you just don't back down /v Kills me how they talk about blind loyalty. It's was the msm is doing everyday! /v All of us off white people were abused by the Romans and the Turks. When the Europeans found out we were not pure white the beat us and nearly killed us all. Off White is out of sight! We need to be as violent as everyone else to show off white need special treatment too. Death to all colors but mine (and the green people of course) we hate racist brown, black, yellow, red, and white peoples of the Earth. What I hated most they would kick us and call us as the puppy word, I hate being called puppy and kicked by all the evil racist white, black, red, yellow, and the worst were the brown people. Sana Anna killed almost all of us who were in Mexico. Genocide' he was a tyrant killer. Up with off white down with the rest of the world. Oh yea we believe in raping and robbing everyone. It's just in our Genes. We do not have an ability to follow laws that were not written by any non-off white so we do not obey your laws. Can I get some money now? Some free housing? I just need bus money. Off White Lives Matter...More!\nWe once had a beautiful mountain kingdom everybody loved one another and we were seen as very successful by all the other kingdoms. The valley people wanted our riches, we told them we would gladly share them. It wasn't enough for the people below to share in our success and they invaded us killing everyone.\nAfter the valley people defeated us they dug into the mountain in search of our treasure, what did they find? /v Bannon was right on the money! Funny Liberals trying to play all moral, and high. You people talk about blind loyalty, what about supporting Hilary? You liberals are out of touch with reality! /v Irishthey should have just sticked to be in a bar drinking /v slime ball. these people got conned by a con man. tiny hands is a con man. /v Love Bannon. /v Amazing /v Real Red Neck /v Bannon is obviously syphilitic. Black-hearted, and dying. /v He looks like a character off The Sopranos /v I wish Bannon was President.  He wouldn't be flip-flopping like Trump. /v HERO! Working class, irish catholic, white, nationalist, and honest....ALL THINGS LIBERALS HATE! /v MSM snakes at it again /v Former White House Chief 'Tragedist' lol.\nClassic freudian slip? /v Charlie Rose's remaining corpse got rekt big timw by Bannon. /v Bannon a worthy successor to Andrew brietbart /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQF3Hi0VKs /v greatness /v Great job Bannon! /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgliVyV1WqY /v So Trump is just lawless! /v bannon is fantastic /v BANNON Rules!!! /v Lard /v Bannon 2020 /v Bannon the Barbarian!  /v I love Steve Bannons loyalty. /v Body Language Analysis No. 4057: Steve Bannon's 60 Minutes Interview - Nonverbal and Emotional Intelligence\nhttp://www.bodylanguagesuccess.com/2017/09/body-language-analysis-no-4057-steve.html /v People cared! Remember who won the popular vote. /v Bannon is a great American and has a far better grasp on history and reality then the entirety of our media. His thinking is exactly what this country needs and what liberals and the media don't get about our country. /v Gatling  Canon Bannon Rapid Firing Show.I  can see Political Pansies Melt Down.

Love This Song & You Both !\n All The  & Luck In The World On Your Continued LOVE STORY!! 20/40 years #BLAKE... HELL YEAH...!! GWEN ur BACK WITH A BANG GURL!!  /v omg whered all the good ole boys go?! Blake is gonna go get married like dis and i ain't even seen any1 hold door for me WOW\n\nPS: BLAKE GAY?!? /v Cool ! /v I've thought of building a playground for our dogs, but this is awesome! /v Hello /v What a great daddy! /v Who waching in 2017 /v some people seem to assume that this guy is making these facial expressions out of humor during very traumatic time. Exaggerated facial expressions are forms of grammar necessary in Sign Language to make sure those who need it understand the severity of the situation. It may seem funny to us but its fairly common for this to be done. I think its awesome and I can totally see the humor and if people take that, thats cool but understand this isn't being done to mock or joke about the situation. He is doing his job as best as he could and I feel he did it brilliantly. /v To all viewers who do not know American Sign Language:I am deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). This guy is doing a fantastic job of interpreting for the deaf! His facial adverbs equate with the spoken inflection and gravity of the emergency situation. Hurricane Irma is a serious threat and it cannot be taken lightly. This certified deaf interpreter just conveyed that. /v His facial expressions enhanced his explaining.....I thought he explained this dam good. /v He's a Cerified deaf interpreter (CDI). He does not hear the noises he's making. How it works is a hearing interpreter sits in front of the deaf interpreter and signs what is being said. The Deaf interpreter then interprets that into American Sign Language. Deaf interpreters are used because a native user/speaker of a language can convey the meaning clearer than a non-native native signer. Deaf interpreters are the best choice in a emergency situation (and many other situations) to meet the communication needs of the entire Deaf Community. There are different dialects of sign language. This interpreter interpreted the information in a way that any deaf person can understand...which is the point. /v I would like this guy to translate everything I say. /v This guy just made about 900 GIFs. /v This guy is the next internet meme. /v ROTFLMFAO - With all of the horrible news of the hurricane, THIS GUY brings forth a new way to watch these otherwise gloomy news conferences /v Oh my goodness, I know this is serious and all but they found the Italian De Niro Sign Language Guy :) /v adding some humour during a crisis lol love this guy /v ..You hoax people know nothing first  in some cause 's they use facial expression  like in Florida ..Know the  facts before you credits some thing that you know nothing about . sing langue /v You should probably amend that to Gov Rick Scott gives a warning with ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter, emphasizing the seriousness the situation for the deaf/hard of hearing audience. There IS a difference - putting deaf first implies that the interpreter cannot hear, which is obviously false since he is listening to Gov Scott and interpreting into signs.\n\nEdited to add: I saw Pam's comment. I stand corrected. /v Is this like Dolby surround sound for the deaf? /v People don't realize that he isn't being overly enthusiastic or anything like that. This is just sign language. That is what sign language looks like. You use facial expressions like a hearing person might use vocal pitch. I love ASL so much becasue of that! /v Honestly I never knew sign language includes facial expressions, now I know. /v This guy loves his job. /v It's funny because he's not trying to be funny, he's just trying to be as clear and expressive as possible. /v Yeah, I know that chick. Crazy in the head and crazy in the bed. /v He thought governor was talking about an ex wife. /v HE FORGOT THE 7 IN THE PHONE NUMBER- EPIC FAIL? /v Pause at 0:58, hilarious with his tongue out. Yes, I'm well aware that's the only way to emphasize in sign language, but still, it's funny. But what's even funnier is what is the point of all the men just standing around the governor like statues, it's pointless. Just have governor Scott and the signer up there. /v He's one of a few that caught my eye.  I agree, he's a great bit of humorous uplift in times of such gravity.  Highly likely that he signs this exact way every time he signs - no matter who is watching. /v Check this IRMA HURRICANE HUMOR ONE LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q04H0Z1L-zY /v i farted awww /v  /v That Face !! /v my 4 year daughter want to see this video again and again. More sucess than Disney's  Frozen. What is the name of this guy, i want his version of   Dunkerke and Star Wars. /v WTF did I just watch? How did the governor make it through his speech with that going on next to him? This guy reminds me of Mr. Bean. /v He is the real deal and he is good.  He is a CDI.  I recently took a workshop he taught. To the untrained eye, his facial expressions are funny or weird.  But to native signers, those facial expressions are the most important part of the language.  They are the equivalent of vocal tone and punctuation.  Interpreting students have to learn these facial expressions.  It takes months -> years to learn this.  You want funny, you should see a class of new interpreters practicing facial expressions.  Also, there is a lot of work here.  The speaker, the off camera interpreter (who can hear) signing to him, so he can interpret the msg. and sign it in ASL. W/O facial expressions he's like a monotone speaker who says uh every other word.  Chinese sounds funny to me too, but that's because I don't know the language. /v If you think that's funny, you should see the sign language guy for blind people! /v Thanks for signing the phone number so I can call and talk to....oh wait.. /v I don't know what's funnier, the mime guy or the gubner wearing a baseball cap. /v The interpreter is awesome. What's his full name? Does anyone know? /v this just needs some beats.  /v He was clearly mocking the governor, how can you guys not see that? /v Just like the global warming scam, this guy proves these deaf people have just been fucking with us all along.  *waves arms wildly* /v This has to be some nut that pretended to be the sign language guy or whatever they are. This is like a SNL skit. There's no way this was real /v I think this is over the top. It distracts the viewer from listening to the important message given by the Governor. How can a serious message possibly be 'translated' by such weird facial expressions? His expressions don't seem to match the words. /v Is the tongue really necessary /v I am deaf. His expression is not funny, it is the expression of seriousness of the hurricane and he is signing in true ASL that covers all levels of communication of the deaf. There are level of communication that come within the culture where there are spectrum of deaf level of understanding. It appears whoever post this lacks understanding of the deaf culture and it's situation. I assume you are hearing and do understand that you see only the expression and not it's signs that are visual and representable to the context of the language and situation that is happening that could save the lives of the deaf community. I hope this provides an insight to change your title of the topic of the video. /v This guy should do stand ups!!! /v Is that real sign language or is this guy clowning around making gibberish? /v Iam sure he is just making it up lol /v Fake. /v Just watching his facial expressions and the noises he makes are too funny!! /v I've got an Alcatel pop 4 .It's pretty good for 70 quid. This a30 fierce is markedly better. Better camera for sure /v My LG l Bello is horse shit compared to this Alcatel \n(it was also 120 more expensive) /v Austin Evans would you please tell me a price range of what you make on youtube? I would like to know because im trying to prove to somebody you can actually make money off of youtube for a job. And i am graduated and im getting in trouble for playing too much.

Stupid people - don't you KNOW by now Google records Everything? /v Hey Austin this is guys. But what do you guy Austin think? /v Try the ouktiel u20 plus, 1080 res. Dual camera and 5.5 inch display and fingerprint /v For some reason it doesn't look look like it's 80$ /v An 80$ Phone has more functions than a 1000$ Iphone /v Dude looks tired as fuck.\nGet some rest. /v TWO FOR$85!!

I've been doing the $80 phone challenge for the past 5 years /v A head phone jack!

OMG!\n\n\n\n\nsrsly. /v Austin Evans is a tech reviewer with a self-entitled youtube channel... /v All the tech youtubers these days only making sponsored videos. Thats both a good thing and a bad thing. We get to know about new stuff but we don't get to know the true faults behind that thing /v $80?

In the USA, it would be gone in *2-3 minutes* . Especially cellphones and labtops. /v Oh and another thing: just this morning I was taking the ferry to uni in Venice, sitting next to some Japanese people. They left for a moment, leaving on their seat their camera and their umbrella! They literally left their Nikon camera on an unattended seat, you don't do that in Italy  /v In Singapore we mainly use packets of tissue paper or namecards! /v In my city, those belongings are definitely gone in minutes! /v In my country if you leave your phone or anything on the table and go for 1 minute it will disappear like magic /v Try that in the Philippines I dare you! You don't have to leave your valuables for it to be stolen from you. Or your life as well. #Pinoypride #reality /v Could do a video about bicycles in Japan? I just looked up bike jail and it sounds like a very Japanese concept. In a good way. I just heard on the news today that bike theft has gone up by more than 13% in my region as bikes get more expensive and people tend to report more. /v I've had my car broken into once. Luckily I did not leave any items of true personal value in the car that day. The thief/thieves must have been pissed caused they grab every pointless thing in the car.  They were so desperate they even took my spare tire in the trunk...joke was on them though, that tire has been flat for weeks...LOL!!!!!!! I would love to have seen their faces when they found out. LOL!!! /v Its awsome that they dont ask to subscribe at the end of the video!! /v In Poland (and probbably in most other countries) it is common to save your spot by putting a shirt or a coat, an umbrella or a bag. Yet you should not leave any valuables (also in said bag) as they might get stolen. Also, the things that you leave still do not grant you that you will keep that seat as others may relocate your stuff to a different free spot that may not be as great as the previous one (views for example). /v In my part of the world , they have a saying : \n Gear adrift is a gift .... \n\nAnything left laying about will go missing almost immediately . \n\nYou are careful about showing valuable items when using them ... someone might rob you . \nEspecially high-dollar items like expensive watches , jewelry , cellphones , laptops , etc . \n\nYou never leave children unattended , as kids come up missing all the time . \nHeck , adults get kidnapped and held for ransom or murdered here . \nDrug cartel members have gun-battles on the streets . \n\n You keep a close eye on everyone around you . \n\nI have thwarted a couple of robberies simply by being aware and prepared . \nAvoiding being caught in what was an obvious set-up . \n\nScammers , thieves and robbers are a simple fact of life . \nYou watch for them like you would dangerous animals  , or poisonous spiders and snakes when out in the wilderness . \nThe wilderness is actually safer , and I spend a good bit of time out there . \n\nI've had tools and things stolen out of the back of my truck , and my house broken into . \n\nYou have to lock everything , all the time . \nI can't imagine living somewhere so urbane . \nTo us it seems careless . \n\nAnd no , you don't get to reserve a seat before you order . \nYou order , then find a place to sit , if alone . \nIf you are with someone , they hold a spot , with your gear , while you order for everyone . \nEven then , you watch out for each other . \n\nTrouble can start at any moment when you are out in public . \nYou have to be ready to grab your gear , and fight your way to safety , at any time . \nCertain groups thrive on causing trouble , it's entertainment for them . \nYour gear becomes their gear , if you lay it down , or they can take it from you . /v I kinda want to live in japan just for this... But I hate winter. /v I piss on the spot i want...my dog taught me that trick /v Lmao this is what we do in our school (though it's kind of dangerous to do this outside the school) /v In Singapore we leave a packet of tissue on the table. Anything else will probably be stolen or deemed as forgotten items. /v The lesson here folks is by all means, leave your valuables to save your spot in Japan. In fact, the more valuable, the better. That's why I always leave my kids to save mine. \nLOL /v This is why I love the idea of moving to Japan. It is the antithesis of where I live, quite genuinely and I need to be in that kind of environment after all these years. /v life would be complicated for the foodicted like me but love For Japan for their simplicity. /v I do the same here in UAE, never had an issue but I think its a bad habit /v I'm  sorry  but I think  saving  spots is rude on it self and unfair to others, unless a person is wanting  there I'd be ok with it. /v I'm natives american. From Minnesota. On our tribe you will find many tight knit families and close friends. Recent economic growth has led to entire streets of house's being reserved for one family with a common name. We are close knit. At event's the best seats are reserved for the elderly and accomplished. Besides that we share so well nobody would hold a thought that was stingy or aggressive. It's more about the activity.:) /v In South Africa, don't leave anything anywhere, it will be  gone in 5minutes. Also saving a spot is heavily frowned upon. /v I'd rob them /v That last line xD;;; /v in oldham you either do the same or have a m8 sit there and you auder there 4 therm /v How do you save your spot where you're from? ROFL! /v Probably because Japan has a 95% conviction rate and harsh environments in prison. /v In the US if you leave your stuff it gets stolen or someone argues with you saying you cant save seats like that or will probably push your stuff off the table. Lol /v we do it in turkey too :) /v in NYC, there would have been 10 cops with the bomb squad. we don't mess with unattended bags haha /v Beware if you see a small pack of tissue in Singapore food court table. /v Usually when I'm with friends or family whomever gets their drink first is tasked with finding a spot for the group. Not sure if ordering is the same elsewhere, but once everyone has a drink we sit and wait for the food. /v I also do that here in our country Philippines but I make sure that i only leave a less valuable thing in the table and look whose nearby my seat so if anything happens or if my things got stolen i know who to blame  /v Unfortunately, I think the video is sending a wrong message. Although Japan is considered to be generally safe, thieves do exist and I know people who had their bikes stolen multiple times. So no matter how safe a place are, it's your own responsibilities to take care of your valuables. /v Here in the USA......it would be gone .....even if you turn your head!    But in church ......no I can safely hold my seat with my jacket! /v Only Tokyo in Japan. Other cities in Japan are more relaxing. /v In america you dont /v We do this in the Philippines... but before you know it, it's gone. lol\nSo yeah... Japan... you seriously have the most disciplined people in the World. TBH /v I once saw a lone WALLET save a seat at a restaurant in McDonalds. Really? The literal EASIEST thing to steal and you choose it? /v We leave a bag or something ...I'm sure a smartphone or a laptop would be snatched up rather quickly /v Unfortunately since 9/11 if u leave bags around unattended for a while in Australia they may get reported to security or police because of bomb threats. Not that we have much of a problem in Australia with terrorists. \nI wouldn't leave my valuables to save a seat, better to b safe than sorry! /v Love the girls shirt at 4:00 /v In America you would never leave anything valuable unattended. It would get stolen in minutes. You would put your soda and napkins in the table. I love your video's. They are very informative. /v Lol. We also do that in the Philippines /v In Portugal, if you're with friends, someone sits at the table while others get food. If you're alone though, you're out of luck. /v I got four minutes of my life stolen by watching this video, maybe the next video could be on Japanese immigration policy? /v In Poland you'd have to leave behind a person, preferably someone difficult to move. /v Well.when I try to save my spot at school people move my stuff /v that's why i always leave my kids to save mine LOL /v I noticed a lot of Japanese men are wearing Fanny packs these days. Just not around their belt, but like a mini, one strap backpack /v It's the same in Singapore! They call it 'chope'. However if you do it in Indonesia, your stuff will magically gone in a few seconds lol /v Warning: Dont try this in New York /v How does someone forget to ride there bike home?  Is it just me or is that weird? /v My parents will either leave me and my sisters or our coats.  Sometimes I have to take off my shoes just save seats :/ /v by leaving your friend alone on the spot /v We sit on the spot to save it in Bangladesh /v In the USA if you leave your stuff anywhere be prepared it will be taken that is unless someone so kind with a good heart will return it to where someone can retrieve it easily. One day I was at a mall where I left my bag with two items I bought and thinking someone would return it to lost and found but apparently it was take so I had to rebuy. What I do is when I am alone I don't ever save seats because its pointless however if I am with someone then I have that person save us a seat while I take orders for both of us if its take out or if its order in than me and the person I am with whether it is with my hubby friend or family will take turns to use restroom. /v There is no such thing as, saving your spot in Los Angeles XD So sad /v Just because you can have faith in a chair doesn't mean you should jump up and down on it.\nCAN you use your wallet to save your space? Probably. Should you? No.\nEven if the Japanese were 100% trustworthy- and they are not, there are millions of foreign tourists there every year. Just because Japan is extremely safe doesn't mean it is 100% safe.\nLiving there for years, I became aware of some incidents of theft. However, I will always say that Japan is a great place to travel solo, as crime is extremely minimal. You can use backpacks or bags behind you without any real fear if being ripped off. You don't have to worry about someone rummaging in your bags while you get your wallet to pay. If you ask someone for directions, or look at a map, or otherwise be distracted, you are extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of. But you're still not 100% safe. Don't tempt fate. /v Holy cow. \n#41 on trending. \nWay to go Greg. /v What a blessing it is that you live in such a safe place!!!! I could never save a seat with my belongings. :( A great eye opening vid. Keep it coming!!! /v So basically what you're saying is Japan is the best country to steal stuff /v Some people in my country use their car keys /v We save spot in America with our NON valuables.... lol /v We do the same thing in Canada. I live on the east coast. /v Did you actually recorded dog poo? 3:08 /v In korea and japan, you can leave your wallet, purse, or cellphone on the side walk and no one will even touch it.\nThen, they go to US and get robbed at gun point. /v I move   the stuff and put it on another table. If people are not there then too bad. You lose the spot. One of the things I find really irritating about Japan. /v You take the whole chair where im from /v 3:17 That scene transition looked like your daughter was your wife... lol. /v Try to do it in the U.S and I guarantee when you come back your things aren't gonna be there /v We leave a person in London, UK everything would be stolen. /v I've often noticed how similarly priced Japan is compared to the Netherlands. Price to get your bike from a bicycle depository after the municipality had it removed? 22.50 or 2 925.60 at the current exchange rates :o\n\nIt's not just leaving stuff behind to save seats, you can safely leave your stuff unattended for a while. When I arrived in Japan my friend and I went to the shopping centre under Tokyo Station and because there was so little space in the shops themselves, we left our bags near the entrance as much out of the way as we could so we wouldn't be a bother to other people while browsing. /v So Japan is so safe, police have enough time to just sit there and spy on a bait? /v If you are a thief do not watch this video please. /v i left my janky old non-fuctional skateboard at a gym for 10 minutes and some took it.....(us) /v lol if you leave your bag at your table in Jerusalem the bomb squad will blow it up with a robot /v Wait, why am I watching this? I can't afford going to Japan. /v I accidentally left my hat on a train station. I have to ride back to the said station to get it at station office. Speaking little Japanese, good thing I've got a selfie of me with the said hat on my phone, making of retrieving it easier. Everyone at the station are so helpful and kind.:) /v I went shopping in kyoto and left my video camera and gimbal at checkout.  It was 20 mins later that i realised it was missing and rushed back to find it still sitting there.\n\nI love japan!! /v Japan have the lowest crime of all cities in the world /v This happens in my school's library /v Do any of your kids see hachisakama plz I am so srry if they get scared Google it /v Japanese tourists even do this in Hawaii. I saw this in a Waikiki food court, so I did it too. Mainland there is no way I would leave valuables at a table. Sometimes in a smaller place like a Starbucks, I will leave a jacket. /v *i would switch different left items so that when owners come back they will struggle to find them and will think twice about leaving them there the next time* /v Nice shirt /v With packs of tissue wipes.  /v  /v  /v Bike Jail! lol /v davao too /v What is Burakumin? /v  /v Ahhh typical dad joke. Laughed though so whatever- /v Congrats on trending!  /v Haha those turds thoooo  /v  /v In USA you go with more then one person. One person sits and saves the spot while other gets food, goes to restroom or whatever. If you are by yourself....you don't save your spot. When you get up you lose it. /v The lesson here is: move to japan. The way to save your spot or your belongings in London is eating at home. /v poor Aiko. /v next video: food you can make while driving /v I didn't tap on any YouTuber's who had anything to say about the hurricane I'm living through I felt most was just hopping on what was trending! But I said self not him self said hummmmm so I tapped on YOU! Thank you you really care! /v In the next video: How to watch youtube videos with no power. /v So many catchphrases /v Could have torched the cheese on the pizza. But a lot of those things need refrigeration like mayo, cheese and butter and most stores do not have even those foods once the storm hits.........no electricity. /v Watching just for being lazy /v CRAZY TAGGLER!!! /v Don't lie /v I'm from Saint-Martin, living in France and still haven't hear from my family. Thanks for this vid, love ALL your vids.. /v MAKE A FIYRE /v  /v barf inducing /v Thank you! /v Shit was week /v Thank you /v This video reminds me of my friend Thomas and our drunken college days. He would raid my cabinet and make a delicious meal with the random ingredients I had on hand. /v and congrats to your bro on the wedding! /v I had a hard time understanding how you'd be unable to cook without power. Then it hit me, electric powered stoves. I've always used gas fueled stoves my whole life so even when storms cut off power, i can still cook. /v Thanks bros! /v we need camera,.thumbs down /v Great advice /v you're awesome dude!!!! <3 God bless you /v Don't suggest the Mayo. If they don't have power then the last thing you want is spoiled mayo that hasn't been refrigerated or the power had been out for a few days.  J/s /v I have a silly question. How will they watch the video with no power? /v Sometimes I watch these videos and wonder if the target audience is high, and other times I find myself asking how I never thought of that /v How is someone in Cali meant to see this lol do they just have wifi hotspots set up in the eye of the storm along with free wireless charging /v where u from in north Carolina /v Just went through Irma yesterday and we ate good. Ice cream Sunday, steak sandwiches cooked in propane. And damm you can't forget the home made wine. /v Awesome video. Thank you! /v The second repice is very similar to that one which i learned from my uncle. You're cooking a pasta then when it's ready add some cane fish and some other things u have in the fridge like vegetables, mustard, ketchup if u like and u can eat it warm or just put it in a fridge and eat it later.\nBe safe and have a good one guys! /v God bless you! tip: umeboshi was widely used in old Japan in bento boxes to make the food last longer, so day one cooked protein and more will last you up to 20 hrs if you put several umeboshi in a box with it /v How are they supposed to watch this if they don't have power? /v just the other day some guy in an alley came up to me and told me I had to try these sardines. Then he reached into his pants so I walked away /v For mayo/ miracle whip/salad dressing Dollar Tree makes little jars. You could either buy before storms or buy & occasionally use them bc they have a couple of months self life. I think this video was an awesome way of showing support! /v i love how the background and his dressing is so appropriate for the theme of this video #attentiontodetail /v Did they both move out of New York? /v I wanted to say thank you for this vid, from the bottom of my heart. Sent to Mom in FL. She thanks you as well  /v Pause and be grateful because I have something 100% accurate! Love your videos. I've been without power for almost 20 hours and I really appreciate this video! /v Rofl. He moves his body as much as a rapper. Looks like he's dancing. Watch from 0:16 and for like 10 seconds. xD! /v How should I say , your channel it's just like cooking version of hacking. Keep up the work. /v How will they see the vid with no power /v My thought's and prayers going out to everyone affected by Hurricane Irma. My heart goes out to you all. Please be safe and careful. I'm thinking of everyone right now. Love to you all. <3 /v Things you can do in your car in traffic: pulls out a blowtorch. /v It's not meant to be fancy food. The food may look awkward, but it's not about how the food looks, it's about using your mind and what you have and use the best of it. In a bad situation people need to come together and try to comfort each other in the best way possible, ever if you make a meal with whatever you have. This guy has a good heart and good intentions /v Awesome stuff but man we will not be crazy like that in the event of a hurricane /v was that a bobo bar in the oatmeal alternative? /v This guy is hungry /v Thank you so much for this video! I looked on google the last few day and couldn't find anything this concise. I'm in Gainesville so the severity of Irma and how long we will be without power is unknown. We are about to get the worst in the next few hours and it's so nice to have some yummy recipes to look forward to that we can make without power. /v Just a little too soon brah? I don't think evacuees are concerned about cooking.  /v How do I cook with no power during an earthquake? /v How am I suppose to watch this with no power? /v Thank you. The first YT to acknowledge this major disaster (in my feed).  /v I had to pause your video to make the tuna dip and it's REALLY good. I would never have thought to add what you added, nor would I have thought to eat it with tortilla chips. \nThis is why I love you guys!! New AMAZING ideas. /v Food is definitely comforting. We had a fire that destroyed my kitchen and left toxic smoke everywhere and had to evacuate. Fortunately my insurance paid for a hotel. We got a suite with a teeny kitchen. My mother in law was with us and we went to a store to get supplies. We all went off in different directions and got stuff and we ALL came back with baskets filled with comfort food. Mac n Cheese, White bread, peanut butter puddings etc. It helped us through the first few awful days. /v Cooking implies heat is involved. Instead you prepared a piece of bread with debris on it. /v if there is no power now hiw the hell they will see this video /v Hahaha welcome to the amazing world of PRISON FOOD lmao.. and Im not being a hater. Im just saying this is the kind of crap prisoners have to endure all the time #empathy /v Anyone who tells you to refrigerate an uncut tomato is wrong and I don't trust them. /v sardine world 1/3 of the plot of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs /v Usefull ! I'm actually having a kitchen makeover so no oven no refrigerator ! /v Thanks for the suggestions.  I've pretty much batched cooked some items that we could eat cold to be prepared for the power outages in Atlanta GA.    I'm vegetarian and my son eats everything. /v Upload some more how to eat food with no food fam (   ) /v I wish this would have came out when the stores where open /v Massive respect to you from England. USA vs Hurricane you guys normally win everything else! Good luck out there. /v now this is what we call profting off of tragedy.\n\nHOW TO COOK WITH NO POWER. USE GAS CAMP STOVES. MAKE A SANDWICH.\n\nThanks youtube guy /v Hi from Tampa Florida. About to lose power soon. Thanks for the comforting video. I made sure to stock up on food and water. /v Excellent idea to make this video! Very thoughtful /v And here I'm sitting in Tampa ready to eat cold beans straight from a can ;) Thanks for the ideas!! /v I live in Ohio  /v THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS VIDEO!! I'm from florida and this will be very helpful especially when the electricity is out /v josh is a in colorado now :,( props to you though Josh. we love you and that seems like the perfect place for your zen lifestyle /v I just love your whole attitude /v This is so incredibly considerate. I recently subscribed to you guys, and I've never been happier with a subscription. Honestly, you two seem like the best. All the love to you for this, and to those being affected by Irma. Stay safe, everyone! /v Whats up with your arms are you itchy? /v You are so thoughtful to make this video. /v Watching while having my probably last hot coffee for a few days /v As a Floridian, thank you so much for doing this. This is not only helpful, but it's such a kind gesture. You are rad! /v Music in video??? Anyone? /v Thank you for doing this, very thoughtful. /v I'd love to smoke a joint with you. /v Only thing is by the time this was posted,  the stores already closed. So this might be more beneficial for other Hurricanes as opposed to Irma /v You look like you literally just rolled out of bed in this video lol /v Thank you for the love /v love this thank you <3 /v Im from sw florida and its just starting here. if i werent stuck at work the entire time this would be major help for me! Thank you on behalf of my state  /v Watching from Cape Coral.   Thanks, man. /v Would you do a video showing the alternative cooking products. You rushed through and only used the one. Where I live, we are more likely to lose power due to snow. Being able to heat up some soup, or hot drinks can make a big difference in keeping you warm. However, this video had a lot of great tips of things to have that don't to be kept cool. I need to grab some of the small almond milks for our storm supplies stash.  Thanks again for a wonderful video and helping us to thinking outside the box. /v How do people who dont have power watch this. /v wtf is with all that random sht in the background?   XD /v I live in The Netherlands and this video made me tear up.. i can't believe what is going on in the world right now. Best wishes to everyone in this rough time.. and thank you so much for this amazing video you uploaded. I knew that you were a very kind person /v Hey. I used to live in St.Martin and have loads of friends who survived  Irma. Trust me they don't need to cook there these days. Food is not what they worry about most. These people are not stupid. There are so many easily available kinds of food that don't need cooking or power to prepare. You Americans can only microwave stuff so you die without power. /v did he say he moved to Denver??? /v Really great tips and thanks for sharing your stories. I always enjoy your uploads. /v How do you watch this video without power? /v I live in California and we're just watching in horror what is happening in Florida and Texas! This is craziness... and then that freakin huge ass earthquake hits Mexico!??  /v I have a good tuna salad & some other ideas... I am just hoping this helps someone. I'm sure there's a TON of people on here who have family in FL, I know I do. My tuna salad goes great on any kind of cracker, bread, in a tomato, lettuce, or wrap. Especially for people trying to stretch a meal while packing in a lot of vitamins or just use up veggies. The majority of these things will last out of the fridge and even though there is quite a bit of prep, it's totally worth it. You can even just throw all of it on a sandwich in a pinch and get the same flavor. \n\nI came up with this about a year ago when my husband and I were down on our luck and I was trying to pack a bunch of nutrition, & bulk into an affordable meal.\n\nAnyways, I normally use 2-3 cans of tuna, if you only have 1 can, just use that! I've done it before, and it still worked perfectly. My cats usually get part of the can. It's also another way to feed your pets if you need to. Lol So I hit the drained tuna immediately with the juice of 1 lemon. If you don't have lemon, use red wine or some other kind of vinegar. Then add 1/2 - 1Chopped red onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1 seeded chopped tomato or a handful of cherry/grape tomatoes, both sweet & kosher dill pickles chopped, or relish, S&P everything and add a touch of mayo. You could even omit the Mayo if you wanted. The veggies and the lemon juice add enough moisture which cuts back on the amount of mayo needed. The acid from the lemon cuts through the fishyness as well. I have also added celery to this and have topped it with provolone. Could be a great vegg friendly item for people who don't like to eat tuna.\n\nAnother great idea with tuna and or leftover pasta. You can always make tuna salad for 1 day or meal, then make a pasta salad the next. If you cooked a couple days prior to your power being knocked out, it's possible that you already have cooked pasta. If you have frozen peas, add those in with a simple tuna salad made with something along the lines of tuna, lemon juice and zest or vinegar, red onion, and dill weed, or dill pickles. It's another way to stretch something you've already made or use up something you have already. \nThis pasta salad can go so many different directions. You could do a Greek or Italian style, cold/room temp pasta salad with different cheeses, deli meats and veggies. Adding things like spinach to bulk it up. If you add cheese, you should eat it asap obviously.\nYou could even do a veggie wrap with peanut sauce... /v Thanks to hurricane Irma I am with out electricity since Wednesdayso thank you for your video much love from Puerto Rico  /v I have been so stressed about losing power and had a hard time finding how we would eat if we do. Of course we have canned foods and bread but I didn't know how to make full meals with what we have. Thank you for this video and your thoughtfulness. Much love from Florida. /v People need to understand thy even after the hurricane has passed ppl might be without power for a while ... the way it looks is the last thing ppl will care about .. nutrition, nourishment is most important. These are easy recipes.. that ppl can make. Good video /v How r u supposed to watch this without power. Power = WIFI!!!! /v Welcome to here! Hope you're enjoying it :D I used to work 5 minutes from where you're staying. Now I'm 15 minutes away and missed my opportunity to glance a Green. Booo :P /v 2:56 you can literally see my apartment. So, you know, if you want to come by for cake, that's totally OK. /v that last bit isn't silly, hank! either that or were both silly XD I like walking on the actual dirt or grass or just land off new places I go. I dont want to just walk on the cement and man-made things, but the actual earth of wherever I go. /v Watching One Punch Man is always the right choice. /v Hello, beautiful chocolate. I'm sorry. /v So, in like a two week holiday, how likely would it be to encounter a spider larger than an inch in diameter in Sydney? Only asking because if I did, that would be the only thing I'd remember from Australia for the rest of my life. /v I hope all is well over there in Montana man. Those fires are crazy. Stay safe and great video brother!! /v This is such an accurate portrayal of my flying north america to australia monologues. lol /v Ahhhhhhh!!!  Welcome to my city! /v Not gonna lie, the title how to win Australia made me believe this was going to have something to do with the game risk. /v MOUNTAINS! More like NOTHINGS. /v Welcome to Melbourne! I hope you can take some time to go to the South Melbourne Market, Chez Dre, and Bibelot! /v It's interesting that you brought that up Hank, because that's pretty much exactly what's been in my head upon meeting you on Sunday.  I'm not sure that you remember me, but I was the Asian girl in the red beanie, the blue hair, I had a face full of makeup, puffy jumper and healed boots. Now already, I can feel the judgement/ analysis of the type of person you (the reader) think that I am... And that's okay, because it's human nature. It protects you from imminent danger and whatnot. The way I presented myself that day is not exactly what you would call the 'typical nerdfighter' image. It makes me wonder how different your perception of me would have been if I had my glasses on, I'd worn a hoody, and I'd come up to you barefaced (and here I am stereotyping the typical geek or nerd -.- see we all do it). Don't get me wrong Hank, you were lovely, but when you looked at me for the first time it was a look of suprise almost. Idk maybe that's just how I read it. It suddenly kicked in that you had no idea who I was, yet I knew so much about you (your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, your intellect, your status etc etc) and I can only imagine how hard it would be to be meeting all these strangers, hundreds in a row, and being nice to them and trying to make them feel welcome. I realised that your perception of me would be purely based upon this 60 second time frame. (In which those 60 seconds I freaked out, ran up and hugged you, acted like a complete fangirl and said exactly the things I had decided not to say to u when waiting in the line haha). But I feel as if we have this programming inside our minds that automatically works to act a certain way towards people depending on the type of person we perceive them to be or by how safe we feel in their presence. Its not a bad thing. It's just human nature and it protects us. But man, on the other hand, this is exactly the reason why some people are so self conscious and so insecure about what they look like (I know I definitely struggle with that on the regular.. Because I WANT to dress how I want, i want to be able to have fun with what I wear and make up my face so that if u made a collage of my face each day, it would be like a fluid mosaic) We can't stop the judgement, because it is innate, but we can go into meeting a new person with an open mind. I just think its an interesting topic...but I mean, socialising is harddd. Probability of u reading this: probably zero. But worth a shot anyway :) /v I have no idea what this video was supposed to be about... \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v Is somebody giving somebody a handjob at 0:30? /v Even though I'm still ~800kms away from Melbourne, just that he is in Australia, and a city I've been to many times. \nIt feels so much more personal. /v Brought to you by United Airlines! /v Low-pass audio filter is your friend Hank. You can filter out that high pitch noise using a low-pass (lower frequencies pass through) audio filter. /v Thoughts from places! /v I know just by looking at someone if they are going to put me in a category. /v Hank, I really loved that quiet feet-in-grass moment at the end there. There are too few moments that I stop and appreciate such quiet, subtle joys, and even fewer of those when the joy belongs to somebody else. So thank you for the moment, it made me feel. /v Aww, you are making me miss my home town!  Have a great time in Melbourne!! /v I'm so envious of my friends who flew from NZ to be apart of vid con Australia. Have fun! /v I do the same thing at airports, but instead I'll give in to imagination knowing that any info i make up is probably off base, and make intricate plot lines using people's faces /v When Hank uses the same music that Armored Skeptic uses in his intros... there's a hint of irony somewhere in there. /v could you make a video about maturity? how to be mature etc? /v I really like this style of vid /v Staring at people in an airport....what a creeper. Jk /v While you're in Melbourne, swing by Mrk if you can. They do amazing hot chocolates.\n\nOh, and the Aardman exhibit is on at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. You have to see that! /v Welcome to my town. Hope you enjoy your stay /v I thought this was gonna be about Risk /v Idk if your parents are still living in Florida, but I hope they're okay!! And I hope their home is okay! /v I don't really do it as you describe it. I usually just judge whether I like their outfit or not. Maybe if a group of people belong together and think what their relationship could be. Or they remind me of someone which makes me think of that someone. /v I'm so heartbroken that you're in Melbourne and I'm stuck in Perth :(((( /v 1:16 what game is that? /v I really appreciate how good Hank's pronunciation of Melbourne is /v Lol, oh how to win AT Australia, or perhaps how to win OVER Australia (by being as cute and charming as Hank).\n\nI clicked hoping it would be advice to Australia on how to win. /v All of these travel videos have really opened my eyes in several ways and made me realize how much I love travelling... and why. Thank you to the both of you for making me laugh, educating me, and enabling me to live my best life. <3 ~Abby /v Hank, how great is Australia!? I'll let you in on an Australian secret, the best-est and most great-est place in Australia, objectively, is the Northern Territory. AND if you ever felt the urge to visit the prettiest and least populated part of Australia, I know a born and raised territorian who just happens to be an enthusiastic nerdfirghter who would give you a tour for a very speacial price ($0.00!) (ps it's me) /v Ahh that sounds wonderful! I would love to go to Australia someday. My sister studied abroad there! /v NOOOOO HE USED AN O BIKE /v I'm a little confused by the sudden guest appearance of Hank's feet /v Thank you for pronouncing it Mel-bern, not Mel-born. \nI miss my home. I live in the UK now. Thank you for the shots of my favourite city. /v Wow, I didn't realise Melbourne skyline could make me so happy/homesick. I hope you enjoyed or are continuing to enjoy some excellent Aussie hospitality. Love from London x /v I've been to a nerdfighter gathering where we sat on that hill!! So weird... /v So, so, so expensive to fly to Australia, $1,200. I'll just fly to Thailand for half that and likely I'll find as many Australians there. /v Welcome to my Island, I hope you enjoy your time here. /v I have that same shirt! /v I totally wore those same socks this week. /v <a target=_blank href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GEW27DA?tag=doowanwest198-20&ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1504743295417&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&linkId=78c280dcf52ef99dbcfab24bde8de473>Shop Amazon - Save up to $25 on Amazon Fire tablets - Exclusively for Prime Members</a><img src=//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=doowanwest198-20&l=pf4&o=1 width=1 height=1 border=0 alt= style=border:none !important; margin:0px !important; /> /v What's with the foot thing at the end? /v Oh no! Now we will see Hanks feed on a foot fetish side  /v 'drops his VB'. Yeah. I'd do that too, and grab a Coopers' instead. Next time, mate. Next time. /v OMG y is hank at gay hill? 3:24 /v It was by a miraculous feat that you managed to get sun, in this weather, hot enough to melt your chocolate . Either that table was a heat mat mistaken for a table or you somehow concentrated all of the sun available to the  city onto your chocolate bar and quickly take a video before it reset. /v One punch man good choice /v Vacation by Rita Dove, 1952\n\nI love the hour before takeoff,\nthat stretch of no time, no home\nbut the gray vinyl seats linked like\nunfolding paper dolls.

You and I have the same weird pinkie toes! /v 3:38 Can't tell if lighting, tight shoes, sunburn, or vitiligo. /v That success KILLED ME /v hope u have the best time down here!! actually breaks my heart that i can't come by and see u /v Nice shot of the southern hemisphere of Hank's body towards the end. /v Just a couple seconds of Hank foot massaging Australia /v He didn't fall off. /v It's really weird seeing my home town in a vlogbrothers video, heheh /v I can see the building where I work! /v When one of the founders of vlogging does a Neistat style vlog. :thinking: /v It was bit freaky to see my dad's office building in one of the shots and to think that you've also seen it. Feels so odd whenever people I admire are in Melbourne and have seen the same sights I have, yet, it somehow brings greater unity. /v I hope I get to the southern hemisphere before I die. /v I'm going to Australia in thREE WEEKS ................... /v I hope you enjoy the Melbourne weather (every season within a two hour time span) /v I'm from the northern hemisphere (Germany) and currently in the southern hemisphere (Peru) and you just gave me a wonderful thing to do, Hank! I'll definetely do the barefoot thing! /v The sunlight is beautiful and also evil. Beware the sunlight and check the UV index.\n\nWelcome to Melbourne. Also, VB is gross. /v NO FAIR I HAVE FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA AND CAN'T EVER SEEM TO GO /v I'm guessing it's just generic, uncopyrighted music, but I couldn't help but be reminded of Armoured Skeptic. /v I swear there's mountains over there somewhere.\n\nYeah, not looking forward to that haze hanging around the northwest US for the next few weeks. Regards from Boise. /v I'm currently on a rewatch all the vlogbrothers videos binge, and I just got to the Isengard video yesterday. So when Hank said, Remember those? I was like, Yes, you were JUST HERE. Oh, no, that was 9 years ago. /v It's great to know about the way you categorize people. People watching has always been a fantastic hobby. Are you being paid to make these videos? /v I want to be where the people are /v Did the Youtube comment box change? It doesn't seem like you can space things out in paragraphs anymore :/   This is really inconvenient for having long, meaningful discussion when you want to make your messages easier to read. Well.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you copy and paste from somewhere else it works! But still.. this just seems inconvenient. /v Hank seems a bit high on this video! /v Stuck pixel 3:20 + /v One punch ! /v Daves head....Dave green??!??!??!?????!!? /v The description though... hahaha STRAYA /v If Hank Green made Casey Neistat videos. /v My annual summer marathon of Vlogbrother videos once again comes to an end...in September. Yeah, there's a lot of these now. \n\nStill good though! Although there's a lot of death in the later years, I must say. I mean, the videos are also much, MUCH more positive and optimistic overall and about the future as we go along but there's also a lot more discussion on mortality and growing older, as well as actual death (both good news, like how less people are dying now which is great and also the many horrible ways in which living things are dying...and Lemon).\n\nI think the channel is still great and perhaps more importantly, still greatly loved. The Green Brothers may be older, John may be greyer and Hank may have a sexy haircut now but it seems like they are happier and better people than they were at the start of the project and so too are we. \n\nI feel like Nerdfighteria needs a poem, like the Sherlock Fandom does, to encapsulate the wonder of it all, y'know? 221B is a great poem for the latter series and fandom. We need one too. /v Really enjoyed that. /v I thought he was going to do a video on how Australians can win marriage equality... /v Do they still have that old amusement park on the waterfront, St Kilda's I think? /v Who's that blonde woman at the bar? /v Good job watching One Punch Man.\n\nPlease talk about it on the podcast. I feel the discussion would better the less John knows about it. /v ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUNCH!!! /v YES HANK! SPREAD THAT SELF-AWARENESS! /v ONE PUNCH MAN!!!!

I love seeing beautiful black women slay business and win! I'm subbing.

You are funny! /v KKW WHO? lol I cant /v I subbed, you are hilarious /v 10,000 thumbtacks vs melons /v Anvil vs wood /v anvil vs anvil /v 28kg /v 168kg /v 3 stone /v 105.5 kg /v 6 kg /v 40kg /v does it weight 8 watermelons /v 125kG /v about 110 kg? /v 300 pounds /v Comtest: it weights 60.7kg /v 520 pounds /v Drop an anvil on a balystic gel dummy /v 565.5 kg /v if 1 watermelon=1 watermelon\nprobs would weigh \n7 watermelons!? /v Anvil vs ooblek /v I think it weighs about as much as 13 watermelons /v Guess the weight of my dick /v I loved the part with the reverse camera! I feel like each drop that has destruction should use it!\n\nAlso two drop ideas;   Drop an anvil on another anvil. And the other, see how many anvils it takes to split that log! /v Next time, Anvil vs tower of bricks! /v I guess you can call those water melons rock melons now seeing as though there apart of the ground now /v drop an anvil on another anvil, make sure yall have shields or some type of protection just in case /v Well if there is 14 watermelons in the pyramid, you need to realize that they are 75% water, so, given that information, we can use the circumference of each melon (which is about 34 inches) to calculate the volume of each melon. 75% of that is water, and 25% is less dense fruit. Now, our calculations may vary based on formulas, but once you get the weight of one melon you should be home free. All you have to do now is multiply what you got by 14 and you get the total weight of the watermelon pyramid. Pls read on to compare your results with mine.\n\nMy estimates put the TOTAL weight of the watermelons at about 6 trillion pounds plus or minus a few. /v This series of videos is full on awesome!  3 cheers for the guys hauling they anvils up the tower, your hard work makes magic happen.\n\nI still think anvil and/or bowling ball versus line-x melons and eggs is the way to go for the next level of gravity-powered excitement. /v Is 44 your favourite number /v I'm a watermelon weighing professor 274 pounds /v 72pounds 4ounces /v 235.3 /v 30 stone /v 49 Pounds /v Wow /v 84kg /v 100kg /v 101 kg /v 24KG /v Anvil vs pyramid of anvils.  And put an egg beneath them see if it survives /v You should drop a pavement slab onto things from the tower. (If you're strong enough to carry a pavement slab up there) But I'd also like to see you attempt to make a giant fruit smoothie by dropping fruit into a bathtub from the tower (If the bathtub might break, spray the base of it with Line-X) /v 15 watermelons heavy /v melons weigh 1.5 anvils /v 42 pounds /v Anvil vs 20 bags of marshmallows /v Andvil vs manakin /v Anvil v that wood stump /v 40 pounds /v 360 pounds /v 340lbs /v 87 tall glasses of chocolate milk (contest) /v Anvil vs baby powder! /v Anvil vs old car /v 44 club /v Drop an anvil on coconuts /v 59 lb /v Approximately equivalent to 14 watermelons /v 15.5 kg /v 164 pounds for pyramid /v 97 pounds /v 47,3 kg /v It weighs as much as 16 watermelons. /v 261.7 lbs /v i am guessing\n445 pounds /v Love the paint. /v Anvil vs anvil /v Anvil VS Police Riot Shield /v 16.5 KG /v That's just insign! /v The melons weigh 256.5 lbs /v 8 stone /v guys do coconuts /v 102.9 Kg /v 14 water melons /v You can speak indonesian? /v You guys should drop a deli meat slicing blade on stuff. /v You guys should drop a whole load of paper aiplanes off the tower would be sick! /v 1:53 Australia summed up in 1 sentence. /v The true definition of weight is the force applied to an object. I estimate the watermelons to have a mass about 7.13kg each. Earth's gravitational force has an acceleration of 9.8m/s2\n(7.13kg multiplied by 14) multiplied by 9.8m/s2\n=99.82kg multiplied by 9.8m/s2\n=978.23 Newtons /v Weighs about the weight of a pyrimid of water Mellons /v Drop an anvil on a pyramid of basketballs to see will it bounce off them or not /v I suggest anvil on trampoline (obviously a coated anvil so it doesn't just rip through but it actually bounces back up) /v I'd say the stack of watermelons is about 280 pounds /v The sound it makes flying through the air is terrifying and satisfying at the same time /v Was there sand caked in the watermelon LOL? 10:56 /v Children in Africa could have eaten those\n\n\n\n\nSpray paint cans /v Drop an anvil on a stack of the parade snap popper things. /v Could you guys throw things from the Tower on bulletproof glass?? /v It would make my day if u pinned this /v Play a game of darts from the tower. 501 to 0 /v Idk how much do you thank it ways /v Nevermind dropping an anvil on a fridge... Drop the fridging fridge itself! xD Would be epic I bet /v I think it's the weight of 14 watermelons /v I say it would be 150 lbs /v the weight of the melons is 10 donald trumps /v Drop the anvil on 50 lbs bags of flour. /v id recon it is about 280 pounds. Which is 20 stone and 127.006 Kilograms. /v Tie the anvils together as string with rope, that way they don't spread that much. /v you should do anvil vs. mannequin.  like this comment if you want to see that /v 280 /v PROPANE TANK WITH ROAD FLARES TAPED TO IT! /v Peter thanks for having me on, this was a lot of fun and of course it was a pleasure singing with you!

I don't care Kane Brown  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com* /v shit gay real men dont hear this shit /v Wow, this was interesting.  It is trending and I clicked on it thinking I was gonna hear rap or hip hop, but instead I got watered down pop country.  I haven't listened to country music since the 90s when country sound was full of Reba, Shania, Trisha, Patty Loveless, Garth, Pam Tillis,  Sammy Kershaw, Lorrie  Morgan, Tanya Tucker, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Brian White, Dwight Yoakum, Wade Hayes, Doug Stone, Collin Raye, Mark Chestnut Terri Clark and any more that I consider the golden age of true country music.  Now country sounds so blended with other genres of music that I would rather listen to classic country then to return to listening to modern country. /v Love his music and him!!!! /v Oh I love your voice Kane!!!! /v 0:47 .....this is pure class..hats off Bro /v 0:47 didn't expect that  /v Here before it gets viral /v Why wasn't the list of names part said by arya? /v 0:47 /v Arya isn't the one saying I've got a list of names, but that's okay...  /v pissed myself laughing at the whore girl going aaah and then Tyrions oh right after! /v Ros was the best part /v Tyrion: OOOOOOOOOUUUU /v Taylor Swift will want to to an Ed Sheeran type cameo after seeing this! /v inb4 this ends up on an Instagram page with a massive heading saying who did this?!  and no credit will go to the original creator /v I absolutely LOVE this beautiful creation!!

Amazballz /v hahaha amazing! /v Awesome ! lol /v Omg..i love this.. /v brilliant /v Brilliant!!!!! /v Brilliant ! /v It's cool ! Wow! /v This titled me /v  /v QUE HINO /v Does anyone see Ros /v where to sign up to help w his revolution/campaign? /v ive had private care, no care, medicaid, and Medicare, and Medicare has by far provided the best medical care and i pay a deductible, premiums, and copays, but it's affordable ($120/mo out of a $1200/mo income, so ten percent). I'm so grateful. /v Sanders is ALL substance! Truly a model politician. Set him up for a joke, gossip, bickering; and he brings it back to policy! /v Like a boss! /v Bernie gorgeous being /v Colbert hosted a dying show until Trump hate gave himself more time and money. Too bad he cant do something actually funny, productive or at least humane in an hour, rather than the nazi salute. /v Something nice about Trump: Everything he has tried to do (and will continue to do: including ending DACA) has ended up becoming a failure. /v Is it just me or is the audio REALLY tinny sounding on this? /v How about saying something to the effect of thanks President Trump for withdrawing us from the disastrous TPP which I campaigned on myself. Or thanks President Trump for attempting to correct our trade deficits which is something I campaigned on myself. Cant't believe I ever supported this fraudulent sack. /v Holy shit all these liberal snowflake bernie and Hillary cocksuckers. Just admit that you lost and stop crying /v i wont pretend like i know shit about politics but this guy just sounds like a president. trump sounds like a fucking dumbass. am i right or am i right. ivanka says 'daddy can i come too'....... /v Even if universal healthcare isn't a human right, it doesn't mean that it's something that we shouldn't have. /v Bernie could of been our president but he sold out and joined killery and has the damn audacity to be on a late night show.\n\nbernie... you failed us.. /v I could care less about Colbert's political opinions, but its clear that he's milking his entire show now off of Trump and his presidency, and has been for months now. It's very unoriginal at this point. Matter of fact, I bet most celebrities don't even have any clue what they're even saying when speaking out against him: they probably only say it to get attention. /v The book : Bernie Sanders guide to political Karl Jewish Marxist revolution. ....yeah because the bolshevick revolution and the gulag archipelago by Alexander solzhenitzin needs to be repeated again!.....Ron Paul was way better. If he had been elected in 2012 we would still owe 13 trillion in debt instead of this 20 trillion that oblamo caused. Also we have 200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Bernie is insane.....and I'm Mexican....Smh... /v Sanders is lying in this interview, Trump scrapped the TPP which Sanders wanted to do as well. Also, Whoever the fuck was smashing his head on the piano in the last 5 seconds of this video needs to be fired /v Populists think alike; of course some of us how the world actually works. /v Ass. Hurry with the bank fraud case. Knock this pretentious liar, FRAUD down a peg. /v Melania is socialist so Trump must love socialism. /v Corpratists own America and the only hope right now lies in Bernie but there are all these crazy uneducated racists getting in the way. The people that really care about america are almost being drowned out by stupidty and ignorance fueled by the president. /v I will say something nice about Bernie.  He is better then Hillary.  But not by much. /v The way Bernie refused to attack Clinton in their debates, I wonder if he was in on the fix from day-1. /v I wanted to feel the Bernnnnn!!!!! Come back to us Bernie Sanders /v I see a lot of hate in the comments for both parties, so I'm going to be really blunt here, both parties are massively corrupt and the only real difference between the Democratic and Republican parties is which specific industries purchased them.  Can't we all at least agree on that? /v Raise minimum wage? I make 26 dollars an hour and bust my balls for every penny but McDonald's employees want 15 an hour so I can stand around for 22 minutes for a precooked burger fuck you!!!!!! /v Bernie is the perfect grandfather figure <3 /v My duck senses are tingling..... I sense a quack /v Jesus I love this man! /v Who left the door unlocked at the nut house, Bernie got out. /v I'm sorry Bernie but are attack helicopters covered by this medicare? Because if not I'm deeply offended and glad Clinton cheating and stole the candidacy to only lose to the easiest opponent. /v I love you, Larry David! /v My list was \n1.)ben Carson\n2.) Donald Trump \n3.) Ted Cruz\n4.) Bernie Sanders\n5.)my own death\n6.) Hillary Clinton /v Of course he loves giving away free things.. Oh wait he likes getting free things.. My bad /v I'll say something nice about Bernie...\n\nBernie Sanders in 2040!\n\n(Let that sink in for a second) /v DAHAHA TRUMP POO POO HEAD /v Liberals in their playground /v Socialism fucks /v Bernie and Hitlary both need killing. /v Crawl back under your rock communist traitor scum bag  /v Focus on the issues? Bernie why don't you sell out your voters for another Clinton deal and new house again. /v Islam is ful of bloodshed or have you not noticed stop maki no exxuses /v lol... that awkward moment when the embodiment of hope in America points to you as a member of the filthy media obsessed with the drama instead of the important things in the world.\n\nColbert used to mean something and stood for issues, now he's no better than the very media he used to make fun of. \nJon Oliver is the only one still carrying the torch from the daily show. He informs the people, causes real world change even if its small, and is damn funny doing it.\nStephen Colbert is just covering garbage and making fun of trump. I don't usually use the term sold out but its the only thing that I think applies. /v The one that got away. /v I hope he runs again. I would vote for him /v Healthcare is not a human right. /v He has good ideas but if he were real he would acknowledge the real problem in America and large swaths of the world is J$wish supremacy and their omnipotence. They are the banking and pharmaceutical giants exploiting America he talks about. And anyone with a brain knows that voting for this guy would mean controlled opposition and the anti-White bias going even more through the roof it broke through long ago. He wouldn't bite the hand that feeds him, his own tribe I you know that much. He would overtax working class and ultimately keep the ridiculous power imbalances the same or make them worse. The worst thing he would have done is open immigration as a genocidal divide and rule and Europeans as the eternal scapegoat. He would likely recruit directly from antifa and BLM for supreme court and other critical institutions. His own Black campaign Spokeswoman came on CNN and outrageously shouted a sarcastic boohoo poor White people at an old man getting dragged out of his car and beaten only for supposedly voting Trump. And then they are surprised these people DID vote for Trump and call them stupid for doing so. When Blacks attack White people in the streets 24/7 without the politicized, monopolized, J$w run anti-White media or politicians giving a crap rather jumping on any opportunity to brand White people racist and persecute them as if responsible for all that strife. /v I would love to see nationalized health care for all. However, what a lot of people may not realize is if nationalized health care went through everyone's taxes would sky rocket. Additionally, for those who are healthy and take care of their health through wise choices who don't need to see doctors their wages would be garnished tremendously for a service they would not even see. I used to live in Canada and let me tell you while we did have nationalized health all the rich left the country because of the stupid high taxes and it left the middle class picking up the poor. It doesn't work as well as you think it would unfortunately. /v Colbert doesn't really like Sanders, does he? /v This comment section is a minefield! /v I like Hillary, but I can't understand how she blames everyone and everything but herself. you ran a crappy campaign!!!!!!!!!!!! /v Bernie is a cuck that committed bank fraud. it'd be more interesting to see if Trump could think of anything Bernie has done that doesn't involve breaking the law or getting cucked. At least he'd be respectful and actually mean what he says 100%. /v Fuck You dictator Trump!! 2020 the year's of Bernie!! /v He has nothing 'nice' to say, although I dont really believe that is anyone's focus. He continues to disparage Hillary while cloaking it in treacle. So glad he is relegated to a minor position now. /v How does it feel to be Trojan horsed by Bernie for Hilary votes??? /v Donated 1 mill of his own money to hurricane Harvey victims. Beat the entire political establishment with his first real bid for office. Oh, but he used the words Mexican and rapists in the same sentence, so I guess none of that matters. Also created 1 mill jobs, gave up his salary-but what's this? He used the word pussy 12 years ago? Clearly an irredeemable human being /v Ah, two millionaires complaining about another millionaire and a billionaire. Interesting times. /v When people get old, do their necks just completely disappear? /v I dont understand why he doenst just start his own party, then all the progrssives can join and get rit of the 2 party system. This way you have a real alternative. /v Bernie is a FUCKTARD & SO ARE A*L*L THE ASSHOLES WHO VOTED 4 HIM /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Make health care affordable, or we kill every CEO and share holder responsible for keeping the prices high.\nNext day: Affordable health care for everyone. /v He's my President /v OMG a guy who actually understands and applies Humanity! /v Homeboy has way too much makeup on /v burnie is the truth /v ...says the guy who built his campaign railing against Wall St. and the monied interests and then after being screwed over by \nHillary  (the wall street candidate who made hundreds of millions by selling out) quite docilely bends over and plants his lips firmly on her backside, giving her his endorsement.  And we are supposed to take him seriously? /v Please fix America, we need help!! /v please run again Bernie and save this nation from trump destruction !! /v Does the Late Show pay for this spot on YouTube or do they advertised for free ? /v You would think Bernie would have more sympathy for Trump, since both of them have been railroaded by the Democrats.  The DNC conspired to prevent him from winning the Democratic nomination, just like the Democrats in Congress have conspired to prevent Trump from enacting a single policy during his presidency in a successful attempt to convince idiotic liberals that he is a bumbling moron. /v Bernie Sanders is like that old crazy creepy uncle at Thanksgiving that is senile as fuck and just ends up sneezing in the mash potatoes and falling asleep in the chair /v When Steven says hurry say something nice burnie just talks about free college and healthcare /v We could have had this man, but instead..... Thanks, corruption. /v I miss you Bernie  /v Still feeling the Bern! /v Man it sucks being perfect. /v Just croak already /v He looks weird /v Medicare sucks. Trust me, I know! /v Not a contender /v Fuck both Clinton and Trump. Bernie 2020!!! /v fuck this socialist /v #Bernie2020    #FeelTheBern! /v Help me /v Both Him & Colbert are total KIKES. Bernie never had a full time job, he ran for a political platform that would take care of a loser like him, & after selling out to Hillary he fully rooted for her. So he's no different. Fuck that socialist KIKE & all of his supporters. & isn't his wife under FBI investigation? /v Love you Bernie! Keep spreading your light & your truth! I'm a Canadian and enjoy free health care, and couldn't imagine it any other way! In fact, it's one of the reasons that some of Canadians I know will never move to the states. Free healthcare is not a socialist concept, it's a human right. I hope that more Bernies will be born from his leadership!! Sending my love to all my American friends :) /v I feel like just explaining to Trump that health care should be a basic human right would be too much for him. As soon as he hears free health care, he'd make up his mind and stop listening. /v I used to like Bernie Sanders, but he sold out and got run down by Hillary.\n\nNow there's Trump....\n\nThere's some pros and cons about Trump, but I'll give him a chance regardless.\n\nAmerica needs a business man not a politician. /v I wasn't scared of the new movie IT cause he look like Bernie Sanders /v Why isn't this man our president again? /v Bernie Sanders still fighting for the people even though the people let him down. /v I catch fire all over again every time Bernie speak. /v Wish Bernie was our President!! /v Socialism, democratic or otherwise, DOES NOT WORK!!!!! /v We need a latino president not this white people.. they should all go back to England  latinos will control everything.. /v who cares what this old bag has to say /v i dont get it why the USA is still not having healthcare for all\nits not lke the USA can not afford it\ni mean, come on\nits not to hard and it pays off\nit creates jobs, it makes people healthier\nwe have a system (i am from Belgium btw) where everyone over the age of 18 pays 70 ($72) every year for the basic healthcare\nour doctor visits and hospital bills get paid for the biggest part by our healthcare (we pay 1-4 per doctors visit), plus when we get sick our salary is paid by our healthcare to\nif we need more insurance then we are free to take an extra insurance\ni pay around 15 per month for a 100% coverage including private room when i get in the hospital, even when you need expensive artificial replacements like a new hand, new knee...\nand to think we are not even a rich country, even we can afford it /v This is just more media brainwashing.  Everytime there is a Republican president the media goes into overdrive trying to destroy him. /v This man should be our president this very second but instead got stuck with a Russian spy. /v Does anyone really care what this washed up 1960s commie has to say? /v He went from hello, sir to she calls me daddy too /v The long wait is over  it was worth it! Welcome back Sam  I don't care Sam Smith  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com* /v sam smith songs are so relatable and this song hit me so hard, I cried listing to it the first time /v John Saga just made a cover of this and it sounded just like Sam Smith!

Shame /v You are SOOO BEAUTIFUL! And unbelievably strong!!  /v You inspire me so much. I need to stop worrying about the small issues in my life. I can't even fathom going through what are you have went through and and what you're currently going through. You are an amazing person. Thank you for sharing your story so openly with all of us. By the way your speech has improved soooo greatly since the last several videos. Your family and friends must be so proud of you to see you recover the way you are and how strong you remain even through the tougher times.  sending so much love your way. /v You are such a strong woman and just so inspiring. God bless you! /v Court, your speech is getting so much better!! It makes me so happy for you! I wish so badly that you didn't have to go through all of this! You're handling it like a boss!! Hang in there, we love you!! Sending you all the positive vibes, and tons of prayers. <3 /v Two steps forward and one step back.  It's a tough journey, but you are making great progress.  You have so many fans in your corner, cheering you on.\n\nYour posts are very inspiring. /v is anyone else proud that she said radiation? /v You are truly an inspiration. Such a beautiful soul inside and out  /v I know you mentioned you had the issue with the medication that caused your speech to get a little wacky but I just wanted to say that you really are improving!!!! Very quickly I might add too. Keep it up! You will get where you want to be soon! You can really hear the improvement in this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!  /v Glad your doing better. We need to get you a Tennessee Volunteer hat though.  Lol. That Tiger hat doesn't go with your background . /v That sucks! Glad it wasn't a severe reaction. I also have issues with most meds, so first I try a natural approach and if that doesn't help, I take the meds lol. Not sure what you can do for anxiety, but when I'm really stressed or can't sleep, l use a headache balm from Badger (I massage my neck muscles to help with headaches) and it really helps plus it smells good. Hope you feel better! /v Modern medicine, too bad the pharmaceutical industry has been keeping the real cause & cure for cancer hidden. \nDo people even look for natural ways to heal themselves anymore?\nSorry for your plight, please stop the drugs in a controlled way. /v Beautiful lady, stay strong!!! Blessings for you /v You are my hero. /v You go girl!! Love from Canada!!! /v Sending prayers that everything continues to go well for you. Beautiful as ever and anyone who doesn't understand can flop. I have to take Xanax and watch what I take with it. /v I love u girl and all my prayers go out to you always your so strong and an inspiration to everyone around the world  /v THEY CAN TAKE THEIR 6% Chemo remission and shove it up their ASS. MY cannabis oil has been 10000000% better and All Natural and Organic.... /v You are inspiring. Sending love and prayers your way. New sub, thank you for sharing your journey. /v Your such an insiprationn to people going through something like this !! Im currently going thru what your going through and yes its hard but we will get thru it /v please watch my latest video and then do your own search about it\nwatch?v=IMunJYEkbkQ /v I just want to say that I've been following your journey for some time now, and although I know some videos are edited, I want to applaud you for how far you have come. Although I've never been in your situation, I couldn't imagine how strong of a person you have to be, and I know that you have times where you get disappointed in yourself, I want you to know as an outsider how grateful I am of to share your story and to let other who are going through similar events that they're not alone and that we cannot allow these events in our life to stop us from doing what we love. So, from the bottom of my heart thank you!!P.S sorry if I seem like I am rambling, I just want you to truly understand how much of an amazing woman you are! /v : : I have an allergic reaction to anti-depressants so in order to sleep well I take gabapetin (seizure medicine) which doesn't effect hormone/chemical levels but more neurons to sleep well at night and reduce anxiety. It is the only medicine that doesn't have an adverse reaction for me like you mentioned. I totally get it. I'm still thinking positive thoughts & prayers for you.  ; ): : /v I know you like reading comments so I thought id leave you a sweet one! You are such an inspiration and one of my favorite youtubers. We can tell that you love what you do and im so proud of you for beating this cancer! Stay strong, ily!! /v It's probably the mix with the xannax and the chemo pills. /v Keep fighting girl!! You're AMAZING!!! /v Every time you touch your chest you get a yellow mark then it goes away! Is that your skin type or a cemo thing? Xo /v  /v Your speech is amazing. Proud of you girl. X /v You could try medical cannabis oil and also turmeric as it has many health benefits. If you inform about these things, maybe they can help you. /v You should try medical marijuana for your anxiety  /v Courtelizz1 is the female version of Leonardo DiCaprio /v I thought you were going to say that you would not take the chemo and the zanex at the same time. But maybe at least for the year that you still have to do the chemo pills. Hopefully after the year you won't need zanex anymore anyway. Remember to get your support systems going for when you're feeling down. I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. ;)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too. It was an awfully strange feeling and very scary. /v Hey girl glad you're back to normal and your speech sounds great!!! Glad you got things sorted out! Xanax is super strong and does crazy things to a lot of people so don't feel bad! xo /v Your speech is amazing in this videoit's come on so much and you speak so quickly it's so brilliant to hear!! If you're still feeling anxious maybe you could trying practicing CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) obviously just a suggestion and I definitely haven't gone through anything as traumatic as you but it has really helped me feel better and get my anxiety under control /v Hey just found your channel. Much respect for sharing your story. I wanted to extend myself as an outlet to answer any questions you may have about other people in similar situations being helped by medical grade tinctures derived from the cannabis plant. Sending positive vibes and a big hug! Keep fighting. /v Good luck to you.  It's a shame Xanax didn't work for you, but good you figured it out so quickly.  As you said, everyone handles meds differently.  I was on anxiety meds throughout chemo and found them helpful, but I guess I was lucky that the particular med I took didn't interact with the particular kind of chemo I received.\n\nI can't believe the jerks saying not to take chemo, or that whatever snake oil they read about on Facebook would cure cancer.  Nobody without an MD has any business telling someone how to treat their cancer. /v Your speech is amazing! You are doing so awesome! stay strong girl!! /v This is why you should have to get a certificate to have any child... /v Thanks for sharing! You are doing awesome! /v You are amazing  /v Please research gcMAF.  It's a real cure for any autoimmune disease.  Just do the research before you dismiss it.  I've known ppl this has worked on.  It's been tested many times.  The only way it won't work is if you've had to much radiation already.  Peace and much love. /v Your so brave!! Amazing!!! Be strong and keep up the determination!!! /v Chemotherapy = poison to your body.  So yah. It will damage you. /v Your speech has got better! /v You're speech is so good in this video- you're doing amazing love!! Always praying for you  /v Cancer is bad. I don't have cancer though or anxiety. Healthy privilege! /v Thanks for sharing all your experiences its really interesting! Hope you get well :) /v thank you for sharing this! thank you for making us aware about the negative effects of xanax. i also learned a lot from the comments. i have not taken any drugs for my mental health but it's better to know the possible side effects in case i will be needing some mental health drugs in the future because who knows... anyway you're such a strong beautiful girl! i will pray for you! God bless you!  /v you are so pretty with out make up and with make up be strong i will pray for you   take one day at a time  that how i live my life that all we can do   much love to you /v Your speech is so dang good girl!! You're such an inspiration  /v ur such a positive person. u give hope to those that need it. My mom is on hospice care from cancer. I love comin to see your good vibes /v Omg currently im scared i have a tumor because my head feels fuul an i get throbbing right before bed and just noticed i have a flating dot in my vision but cant imagine yiur situation so prayers and thx for you and your openess!! /v Ugh such natural beauty. Why this girl would think she needs makeup, idk! So jelly! :) /v I'm also a young person who ended up getting cancer, and I can't believe how strong you are to put these videos out. You're helping a lot of people, and also yourself because these videos are obviously great practice for your speech because it's coming back really quickly!! Hopefully your reading is coming back soon too so you an read all of the supportive comments everyone has left you. /v Your speech is actually sounding really good to me! /v Have you looked into herbal alternatives to the meds and or herbs and teas for memory like goldenseal and such? I'm only saying because the human body tends to accept herbs instead of rejecting them, like there are natural alternatives to xanax and all ... Maybe worth looking into  stay strong /v CBD oil and some strains of marijuana  help with anxiety and may help with chemo side effects. /v <a target=_blank href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GEW27DA?tag=doowanwest198-20&ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1504743295417&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&linkId=78c280dcf52ef99dbcfab24bde8de473>Shop Amazon - Save up to $25 on Amazon Fire tablets - Exclusively for Prime Members</a><img src=//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=doowanwest198-20&l=pf4&o=1 width=1 height=1 border=0 alt= style=border:none !important; margin:0px !important; /> /v You're such an amazing person x /v Best wishes to you as you're going through this struggle. /v Omg you poor thing!

It could change your life. /v does she remind u of the blonde girl from good lucky charlie /v Get better  /v I have 24/7 vertigo (rocking and swaying sensations) and just had an MRI to make sure it wasn't being caused by a tumor... It is truly horrifying what people have to go through (both young and old) due to medical conditions, some of which people don't realize affects very young people before they even have a chance to live and enjoy life... I am wishing you the best recovery! <3 /v Wish you the best. Gotta be so hard to go threw, not fair at all. /v Glad you are feeling better stay strong /v im with you and my prayers go's  out to you , i have some sored tumor cancer in my chest so is weird /v fuck chemo pills, that just gives you more cancer /v This is so sad that so many still asleep about how bad chemotherapy is. /v THIS IS NOT TRENDING!!!!!

It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube. /v I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden. /v Cannabis helps.\nChemo pills sound dangerous. /v Hello everyone\nSubscribe to my channel please ,,,,,,,,,,, /v Chemo?

I's scattered blood pattern is slanted but resembles an letter I. E's blood pattern on the right side is a slanted E. and A's blood pattern on the right side, the upper is a triangle, and below it is 2 legs, which combined forms an A.

There's loads of good ones and that can actually DO Irish accents. /v The main actress is perfect for this role. /v This is what I'm talking about!, when does it start??? /v so it's basically a mix of The Sinner and The Handmaid's Tale ? /v i love Sarah Gadon. she's like my second Khalesee /v I really liked the book, so I'll probably check this out /v visit this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAYIMaOc2UbqVF9c1-sPZZw/playlists?disable_polymer=true || join and enjoy your favorite tv series /v Anna Paquin is why I'll watch this /v Geez does there have 2 be sex in everything including pilgrims?

Can't wait for this , the Punisher and Mindhunter /v This look good as fck /v Does anyone know if I'll enjoy this show? /v The style and tone seems The Handmaid's Tale-ish (which is a good thing). /v Looks good Netflix. This means season two won't drop until 2021 /v I've read the book, its interesting but nowhere near as action packed and epic as the trailer. They kinda went full action movie to sell it to the crowds. /v Does anyone remember her from that Disney Channel movie The Other Me? lol /v Looks really good/interesting. Not sure about the casting of the psychiatrist though. Looks like he should be on a daytime soap. /v I'll be watching it. /v I have a nun fetish. /v How is it inspired by true events but also based on a novel? /v Sarah Gadon us very talented and beautiful, but sadly atwoods stories don't interest me /v when can we see it? /v Lol looks like netflix realized the mistake they made by rejecting handmaids tale, so they probably bought out rights to every margaret atwood books now. /v (Christ answers Judas. If you love Jesus you WILL keep his sayings/Commandments.):\n\nJudas saith unto him, \n(not Iscariot),\n\nLord, \nhow is it that thou \nwilt manifest thyself unto us, \nand not unto the world?\nJesus answered \nand said unto him,\n\nIf a man (love me), \nhe (will) (keep my words): \nand my (Father) will (love him), \nand we will (come unto him), \nand make our (abode with him).\n\nHe that (loveth me not) \n(keepeth) (not my sayings):\nand the word which ye hear \nis not mine, \nbut the Father's \nwhich sent me.\n\n(John 14:22-24).\n\n***(Loves me...keep my word): In response to Judas's question, Jesus explained that his manifestation to the disciples would be in response to their love and obedience.\n\n***(Make our home with him): If a believer loves and obeys the Lord, he or she will experience fellowship with God.\n\n***(Not love...not keep): If a person does not love Jesus, he or she will not obey him. Disobedience is a serious matter for Jesus words are the words of God!\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Jesus will manifest himself unto you, if you LOVE HIM by KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ):\n\nAt that day\nye shall know that\n\nI am in my Father, \nand ye in me, \nand I in you.\n\nHe that hath my commandments,\nand keepeth them,\nhe it is that loveth me:\nand he that loveth me\nshall be loved of my Father,\nand I will love him,\nand will manifest myself to him.\n\n(John 14:20-21).\n\n***As the believer lovingly OBEYS Christ Commandments, he or she will experience a more intimate knowledge of Him. /v wait is this horror?? /v What's wrong with netflix with this whole male are fucking with women. I believe this shit should go and stop making a remake of the handmade tales. /v She looks like Ellen Page in the thumbnail /v the Background music sounds like cw's the flash. /v First saw her in 112263 and thats where i fell in love with her /v I'm going to watch this. /v A submissive girls wet dream. Sorry the internet has shown me to much /v Seriously thought it was the one girl from SNL in the thumbnail and I was thinking what dumb parody did they make now. /v Looks good let me guess she has split personality /v MMMMM FUCK  HORNY AF?  OOOOO SHIT FUCK MEE TILL I CUM AND JERK OFF ..FUCK MEVIEW MEHURRYFUCK HARDERFASTERm /v Sarah Gadon LOVE ! /v Netflix rocking the Mystery/Crime genre. <3 /v Will definitely watch! /v Soooo.. The Sinner. Gotcha on the premise. /v great trailer /v serendipity: https://youtu.be/BEMaH9Sm3lQ /v Sadie! /v THIS LOOKS AMAZING! /v +mylist  /v Is that David Cronenberg @01.21? Awesome /v Her accent is brilliant. Probably one of the best by a none Irish actress but there is also so many talented emerging Irish actresses that could've been cast. Still watching /v Interesting. /v Gonna watch this for Anna Paquin! /v Sookie!? /v Damn handsmaids tales new season looks odd?? /v  /v Leave Atwood alone /v This looks superb... will definitely watch. /v Yawn /v https://youtu.be/IPlJV-0zGZg /v fake /v I like... /v so the competition begins with Disney... /v Obviously Margaret Atwood likes to focus on class and societal structures, the divide between the wealthy and the servants etc. Not sure how people are struggling to understand that concept. As for the choice of music in the trailer, I think it works. Some people just have a lack of imagination  /v This looks great.  Can't wait to binge on this /v Ooh looks interesting! /v NETFLIX, TOTALLY KILLING IT!!! XD /v Period drama?I am all for it,YEAH! /v Grace Marks: Canadian Psycho. Can't wait for this. /v Wow day 1 /v Looks fantastic /v Mind blown... Whoooshhhh /v LOOKS GREAT . /v Chuck Bartowski! /v Whys this getting so much hate /v More bullshit feminazi propaganda from Netflix /v Why the fuck is this on the trending page?!?!? /v APENAS EM CHOQUE COM A NOTCIA SOBRE ALIAS GRACE. AT QUE ENFIM NETFLIX.  /v Oh my lord, somebody get this woman a dialect coach & quick. /v BOR-ing.  I wanna see a multi-racial lesbian vegan couple (one is blind, the other deaf) sail their Pakistani-made authentic Muslim boat from Papua New Guinea to New York.  They join forces with a militant African-Chinese non-observant Jewish interior decorator 'Maurice' and travel Canada, distributing hypodermic needles & condoms to those in need. /v Trailer should've ended at 1:20. Netflix, you're trailers are waaaaay too long /v This is not on netflix i checked /v Soooooo when is there going to be a show that says Hey I'm fun, cool, interesting, suspenseful, Annnnnnnd I don't have a love interest /v Looks awesome :) /v Fucking scum, all these Hollywood actors/jews are scum. They'll all be dead if Islam has it's say. InshAllah!!!! /v When I've said I'm a cat person . . . I often prefer cats to people they would usually turn off! But, after all these years, she's 'come around'! /v ? You can't date me, that's the only advice I have.? /v yassss, I like it.I love you now  /v I've had enough of females playing mind games, they're mostly sociopaths. /v i date at low expectations /v You can't be yourself if you haven't established to yourself, who you are, so. Who are you? /v lol in the shower all naked and stuff /v I mean I'm 14 so I definitely know everything about boys... /v ...another self professed know it all who thanks to easy access to social media can annoy and irritate way more people than her tiny circle of friends... /v what if being yourself results in a guarantee you will not properly romantically connect with a person? i think 'be yourself' is terrible dating advice and needs more to go off. you need to change yourself and find yourself within that change. my bluntness will always be my downfall in dating, but i'm working on understanding how i should speak what i feel or think.\nside note, you're the prettiest person i've ever seen. you look like god shat you out personally from his asshole /v I think the fear most people have, though they might never realize it, is What if I am myself and no one falls in love with me then...? /v It's funny that you'd post this as well as peomoting Matt Husey.  /v Did she have surgery? If so, for someone who's very transparent, I thought she might mention her breast implants? I guess it's none of my business. /v Instead of being yourself, I like the idea of striving to become a better version of yourself everyday. I struggle to love and accept myself. So what I had to do was think about all the important people in my life. I realized I want what's best for them. If I want whats best for them, that means I should want what is best for myself because they want what is best for me. Wanting what is best for myself = self love. If someone is at the point where they haven't fully explored who they are, why wouldn't they want to hide who they are and compensate by following some strict guidelines to human interaction. If someone takes on this kind of responsibility the self acceptance will come much more naturally. /v Guys, only one thing works. Doesn't matter if your're old, fat or ugly. Money. have tons of it and the girls will break your door down. Boom. Problem solved. Myth confirmed. /v The only dating advice...? So you haven't wondered why you fall for the wrong guys? And why you don't like the guys you should? \n\nI'm completely with you on finding someone that you connect with, but there's a bit more to it than that. If you want to understand why you choose the guys you do and how to find the right guy let me know. I bet I can do better than Matthew ;)\n\nOh yeah, and love your videos. Very funny. Great animation. Great style. Keep it up! /v Hey! When will you be getting more sizes in the ghost and starts appeal?? /v Your sponsors are the only ones I don't skip, it's presented so nicely. /v You ever see the movie Hercules? Where he was so over powered that nobody wanted to play with him? I'm trapped, in human form. /v Anna. You need to tell us where you get you're awesome outfits you wear in these videos. /v Yeah then you keep being yourself, they fall in love with You, then all the sudden they say they don't love you anymore because of who you are. Maybe that means they never really loved you in the first place. Which is fucked up and horrible. /v Just Be Yourself is the Best and Worst advice at the same time. \n\nIts the best because it boosts your ego and helps you sleep better at night.\n\nIts the worst because you dont find a partner you actually want. You may find someone eventually, but it will feel like you settled. \n\nThe dating game is something your not entirely forced to play. But it is necessary if your standards are little more than just like me back. /v Very much agree Anna. You don't need to pretend to be someone in front of your date. He/she should like/love you for who you are. /v This would be applicable to me if dating was replaced with friendship /v I tend to think Anna is right here but what about the abusers hiding behind people with fake reputations and lies that are designed to hurt people in the most unidentifiable way going.Sneaky liars and deceivers.\n\nYou can try being yourself but if when you do others want to get back at you as they see that you're progressing somewhere and they hate it, they hate intensely. They move to more covert methods and hide in groups.\n\nWhat then Anna? How do you go against the masses that are designing your future around you and you don't know that they are destroying your life?\n\nWhy do they do it, I know that it is to hurt individuals they are scared of and others that they don't want around them anymore. Money is a motivator and power is another but there are plenty of others also.\n\nThey picked off old families in posh expensive schools. rich in old lives, rich in the pre-adolescence and plenty of others. They drive them mad in other ways in a end effort to make them strike there pain in some bloody way, can you register the blood baths at schools here? Do you see now why you might be having dreams of death, there is a negative power working around you Anna. Thankfully, you have a lot going for you and your offsetting it. Am I wrong I do wonder all the time about this, do I see the signs or not?People do not see these types as they come across credible and have power, or neither.Where does being yourself go then? /v What's up chicken butt? I don't know you but I love you, Anna. /v So do you agree with Matthew hussey or nah /v That is very bad advice if you happen to be a lazy, fat, dirty slob. If you don't make an effort, you deserve what you get. /v This is why im still single /v Anna, in a non perverted way, and more so in a, Hey, I noticed that kind of way, the rainbow colored shirt you're wearing does a really good job of showcasing your breasts. Way to go. /v Thanks Anna! Keep up the good work! :) /v i love the self call-out at 0:35 lol /v damn girl your views are going down /v Don't date a worthless liberal don't date a college student don't date someone with a nose ring don't date someone with tattoos specialy a woman YUKE. /v Anna K would you ever date an Australian man /v This would be really great advice if you explain how one is to be themselves when we've spent our entire lives hiding who we really are from strangers. /v I don't know how to be other people. Also I am married. :D /v Ironic that Anna is talking about falling in love based on who people really are and to just be yourself, but that clearly must not have been good enough for someone or she wouldn't have felt the need or desire for the boob job. That's not a judgement, she can do as wants as it is her body, but the message and the actions are not consistent with eachother. /v Being asexual, why am I watching this? At midnight? /v Great advice, I think, the only problem is I've pretended to be so many different people I don't know who I am anymore. /v Dam I clicked this accidentally and now I'ma prob gonna like make up tutorials and garbage like that /v Tip #1 don't date this head case. /v Best dating advice: Be yourself*\n\n*and don't be an asshole /v I don't date, im ugly , i dont have a single chance, im probably gonna suicide /v Or they'll like you for your boobs. Boobs are awesome. I like boobs. I am a boob. /v What if I just want to have sex with a woman and have absolutely zero interest in hearing about her vapid, uninteresting life? /v the only advice I can give you is stay away from American women I married a Ukrainian lady best move I ever made. I provide for her she takes care of me. plus she's a very hard worker and helps me with all the chores inside and outside all with a smile /v Would follow this advice, but I don't really know (or remember) how my true self is. lolol. /v Her dad was my sub at victor valley high school on Friday /v I got the only dating advice you'll ever need.....date a clown...BOOM. You're Welcome. /v Well there's phycology behind some of those dating tips /v Yeah. Be yourself and get fake tits like Anna. /v The last time I was being myself, I made a girl call the cops on me.\n\nI think I'm good /v This is the worst dating advice I've ever seen lmaoooo /v I was in the shower all naked and stuff lolz /v LOVE THE SEX EMPOWERMENT THOUGH. YOU GO GIRL... /v still have a crush on Anna. Lowkey cause she has nice fashion sense /v All the advice you'll ever need is in pornhub. /v I think I saw her in that ant man movie.... /v I had to stop sleeping with women on the first date. It was ruining the relationship before it started. /v be yourself...... groundbreaking /v  /v Anna is soooo fun! /v So, girls/women: NO MAKE-UP!! Just be yourself, because you put the camouflage before bed down :) Use natural enhancement only - your smile ;) /v My mom doesn't want me to date just yet, but I wanted to watch this because a guy that can't date yet either and I have a thing, he and I can start dating once he turns 16 and when I'm 16. Watching this, he likes me for me, I can get super excited and jealous sometimes, but he's okay with that. We've never really fought, we get along well, I'm glad to have met him. /v I like your 3d animation on the couch /v Your graphics are  lol strange compliment but I love them  /v saying whatever is on my mind no matter how dark? no thanks, i prefere to stay out of prison.. /v I agree with her. If all you put out there is a false representation of yourself, all you're gonna get is people who are drawn to that fake person. But if you be yourself, you know you're getting true friends/relationships because they're attracted to you for being you. /v SUPER.Anna, U R amazing. Please don't ever change.  :) /v Ok but heck yes to tchakovskys nutcracker in the background /v I love her illustrations incorporated into her videos. that magazine type sponsor bit was really cool /v Clickbait /v i love your videos /v your grandma must be a millenial if she gave you that advice lol, such a millenial advice /v All you have do is hit her back head with club. Then you drag her by hair back to cave. Love easy. /v Is that a stuffed kitten in the background? /v You put my thoughts on the matter into words, thank youuuuu /v Best dating advice ever: BE YOURSELF. It's that easy. I tell all my friends this, and they still ask me to explain it to them. /v I mean if I show women my actual personality they just think I'm super weird and don't like me. So I pretty much have to hide and put up a farce. /v Even I have come to realize myself if kinda depressing. Of course being in a state of depression doesn't help but trying to find the light in every tunnel makes it seem darker for every wrong turn I make. Also I was thinking I should just go to a bar by myself just to sit there with a beer and observe people without looking as creepy as possible, but I get so nervous just thinking about going to bar by myself, or even with a friend. If my friend gets a date, will I just go back home being more depressed, and how will I over come something like that, also if I happen to get someone to like me, how will I contact them, should it be the next day, or should I wait a few days for them to remember what they did, and maybe call me first. If I call with I seem clingly or will she be waiting for me, also if I did call first, I have the thought of will she remember me? Was she too drunk at the bar and gave me her number by accident? Thinking I was better than I was and being drunk only made me seem better than I was. \nI know I just need to have the courage to take that first step but because I have so many doubts and have been rejected so many times in the harshest ways before, how will I over come that fear of being rejected over and over? /v Do people not know all of this already in the first place...?  This is common sense right? /v The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus! \n\nHe LOVES you! Believe it! Don't listen to the lies of the devil. Jesus loved us so much, that He died for us! His Love is clear! \n\nTime is so short, friends. These storms, earthquakes and all the wars and rumor of wars are signs Jesus taught us that will happen before that Day. \n\nPlease call upon Him today if you have not already. Tomorrow is not promised to any of us, however, salvation in Christ Jesus IS Promised. He will save you from your sins! Hallelujah!\n\nShalom! :) /v Being yourself is bullshit.\nBe the best version of yourself.\n\n- Based Zeus /v Anyone got a good Rengar build? /v Yasss there all bs /v We want stay awesome gotham!!!! /v Honesty is the answer! /v Just be yourself yeah thanks like that ever works. Lol im joking i love Anna and her advice /v The best dating advice is Stop giving a crap about what women think and start ignoring them. /v being myself has kept me single for 20 years. heres to another 20. /v Omg! She's a snack. /v Hahaha send this to Matthew Hussey /v Total B.S. /v You are beautiful! /v Stay awesome Gotham /v Super beautiful  /v She sexy /v    18+  http://tinyurl.com/yc7jf5j2 /v    18+  http://tinyurl.com/y8tfaahm /v Chris.

It just didn't appeal to me. /v I'm glad you saved me from spending my money on this movie! /v He hit a million subscribers CONGRATS!! /v Nice shirt. Is that cowboy Bebop? /v That ticket booth guy reeeeeaaally wanted to save you....... /v I bought this ticket trying to sneak into IT but then there was bouncers at the door. Then I tried to sit through this movie with all of my friends, but we all slowly faded out of the theater with intent to off ourselves. /v if you take chance on us there's like an 80% chance that we will not let you down.\nthey've done studies Chris, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time. /v This is one of your funniest reviews so far. I love the bits where you imitate the rom-com silent montages & you read the dialogue.\n\nThis movie sounds like a mess, but I'm glad the review for it is so entertaining! :D /v Less then 2 weeks till Kingsman The Golden Circle /v So Im kinda  pining for the Stuckmann romantic comedy top five extravaganza. Please? It's a genre that gets so many bad movies, but I could really use some help expanding my horizons. I can only watch When Harry met Sally SO many times Chris!! /v I love that you've made the effort to type down the quotes. They're so horrible! /v Chris' face after reading some of the movie dialogue is my aesthetic. /v This guy is a fuckface /v Anyone else see that title and think X-Files? /v That dialogue makes me want to snap Zod's neck. /v 4:30 Oh God. I fucking hate those. That's about as bad as the awful heart to heart conversations in shows like Full House. /v Home Again F u l l M o v i e 2 0 1 7 ( h d ) Available\nClick to Watch  https://plus.google.com/102944905970659999676/posts/SVJb4HWPT6G /v Wow.

Idk backyard appliances or something /v You must review mother! /v WARNING!!! Avoid the trailer of shape of water at all cost. It is full of spoilers /v Do a hilioracity on tomb raider 2 /v Thanks for watching this type of CRAP so we don't have to, Chris!

They never give us a realistic look at the subject matter. /v Haven't fucked with her since freeway /v Movie theater employees must have a ton of anecdotes to tell. /v In the movie freeway her acting is the shit (by the shit I mean good) /v Oh my god I'm so weird the whole time he was talking in the room part I was thinking about grabbing a massive wide knife and just slicing that sleek shelf and whispering to myself slice, slice after a while ._. /v This looked like a shitty movie /v The dialogue bits sounds a little stupid, but I have to go with what Max Landis said in an RLM video. He basically said, if the actors are great and the scene is set up well, you can sell any stupid line of dialogue and maybe even make it iconic. Just read out StarWars Han Solo this way. Anyway, the movie still looks bland and boring. Thanks for the review. /v 0:30 holy fucking shit America! It's called ASSIGNED SEATING! /v I wish I had seen you review before going to watch this movie tonight. It was so so disappointing. I completely agree with everything you said and would add to it that the acting was horrible. /v 27 year olds just screw up proven wrong by Bill Skarsgrd who is 27 and killed his performance as Pennywise /v Stoooop! /v except pico alexander is cute /v I would normally think Reese Witherspoon in a romantic comedy is all u need for success. Maybe this movie should have started out on Lifetime or Hallmark. /v I have a similar experience when I got my ticket for it I walked in the theater and home again started playing and everyone was like what the fuck is this shit /v Can you review ordinary world /v Chris grew up with RomComs /v Lmao when you drowned out the audio and used music over it to make the similar point I was dying laughing, Stuckmann. You still got it /v I kind of dug Home Again.\nI gave it a 3/5 stars, I liked it, just didn't Love it \n\nBut If You want to see something more terrible, watch 9/11 with Charlie Sheen. /v Hi Chris just  a question, why do you make time do see home again but dont take some time to make a review about The Hero that came out this year with Sam Elliott? or the Shot Caller with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. You know it would be some great quality movies with some great moral values to your audience but you decided not to see those movies and went instead to see Home again? Weird buddy, dont you like cinema anymore? /v I am surprised you review this movie.  Didnt know this movie existed /v can you review heroes season 1 just first season /v Don't know if you watch it but a Bojack review would be appreciated /v Aren't you glad real human beings don't talk like that dialogue he read? /v The intern was one of the worst films ever made. /v Hi guys.

I just hope that Jordan doesn't have Spike change any of the dialogue just cause Spike is not the best at writing film anymore. /v Jordan Peele say he tired of y'all talking bout he a sell out!! /v Bruh its Bad Boys 2 /v I'm sorry i'm confused because i thought the Police Force is the KKK. I mean they kill Black people like Deer every other day. Didn't the FBI make a statement saying that All  Police Force all over America have been 100% infiltrated by white caucasian supremacists KKK members /v Two Pisces making a KKK FLICK... they finna expose all that occult sex shit.

He made a few movies with Denzel who made the movie great, not his directing. One of his underrated movies is probably 25th hour. What else, Kobes documentry on espn? It's KOBE. Any old Kobe superfan can put a Montage together and talk about how great Kobe is. FOH  Spike Lee, you gonna ruin this movie. /v First it's Ku, not Klu. Second, why does it seem like all the films that address race recently are about division and not unity? #nothelping #unitedwestand /v Can he do anything but the race baiting movies? I guess he knows his auditory... /v OMG I WANT THEM TO TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY /v Hopefully spike don't do no weird shit to fkk this movie up /v Logic shoulda played the black cop since he's bi-racial /v They should make a slave movie with the role being reversed black owning white slaves would be interesting lol /v if you know the full back story to the realife story. you know this shit finna be fire, although a Lil bit more laid back compared to get out. /v My boy Jordan not playing /v This gonna be good /v Don't make this shit /v When I read Spike Lee and Key Peele team up I went to this vid af, both talented individuals that can express their art beautifully /v Kind of reminds me of mafia 3 if u ask me /v Tell spike Lee he's a goddamn nigger /v Man Will Smith and Martin Lawrence already did the undercover KKK shit Martin even got shot on his ass...But I hope Peele is the brains of the movie cuz Spike Lees last couple movies were garbage ass shit like that Chi raq shit was garbage /v you're the best Natasha /v If Get Out was fantastic, than this one is gonna be better  /v Another big movie for peele and spike gonna be the most profitable movie whenever it come out /v That harry potter guy made a movie last year doing the same thing. /v This about to be the best movie in uh ever /v Somehow flight took a W /v Bro that pic of Jordan Peele got me dead. Nigga look like he constipated as shit. /v Who watching with their dick out /v YAAAASSSSSSSSS /v 0:16 Could've jus said Denzel's Son /v Some shit to watch /v Clayton Bigsby ??? /v Natasha looks better than Nadeska /v damn she fine /v that sounds fire /v Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey /v Ayyy /v Jordan Peele burn in hell you fucking bitch /v Rep Peele /v Dope. /v (-).* Illuminati confirmed /v The Clayton Bigsby story /v Gonna be great /v More natasha /v Watch 'Accidental Courtesy'..This dude Daryl Davis is a musician, played with Chuck Berry, BB King and Jerry Lee Lewis..He knows hella KKK n becomes their friend till they change their mind n give it up..he know so much about KKK that a few of em go promoted n called him on the low to ask him whats their new role about ..hella interesting tho /v ON SOME REAL SHET THIS REPORTER LOOKING NICE TODAY EVERYONE TELL HER TO LET ME SMASH GANG SHET #LETSQUIDWARDSMASH GANG SHET THO  /v I knew as soon as i saw the title that there would be comments about infiltrating Natasha /v Omg I'm so dumb I thought Michael Jordan and pele the soccer player were going to be in a movie together. /v 0:31 she slipped her inner demon. It's confirmed, not only they're hiring annoying people (like Frazier) but they're also hiring demons /v For the culture /v Soo bad boys 2 /v Well this is gonna make white people mad /v Racism is krazy I don't know who made racism /v Flip the script Blacks would feel offended and riot /v I can't way to see this one. /v Ya'll had me excited thinking peele was directing when hes just a producer, spike lee aint anything special /v it happened when i was just a member in the KKK now im one of the leaders. it will not happen again. /v Bet they will wear white face and meet a group and white friends. Then they will go shopping together and bust a huge drug syndicate /v A movie about a black cop who joined the kkk, welp /v Is it a comedy? /v Racebaiting in full effect /v Thats DENZEL'S son for those who dont know /v Spike & Jordan should save there time & money this will be a flop at the box office /v What about creating a fictional story starring Black men and women outside of racism narratives? Bet it wouldn't bomb! /v FUCK SPIKE LEE !!! Quentin Tarantino the GOAT !! /v As a black man fuck get out. \nBut I'm gonna see this one. /v You millienials doing shit in reverse... so much progression in the 60's 70's 80's 90's and even early 2000's.... thanks a lot for nothing u bunch of pussies... Go listen to some emo mumble rap with your politically correct asses  /v Why do ppl have to keep pissing racist white ppl off? Yeah, let's make a movie about a black cop who infiltrate the KKK. Right now with all this racist shit going on it would be a hit!. More backlashing shit we got to deal with. /v We are done with spike after chiraq. His black card has been revoked. /v Tbh I really don't like the idea of spike lee collaborating with Jordan Peele. Spike Lee is just scavenging for relevance, he thinks he's a know it all for black people worldwide. /v anything serious with spike Lee will always be trash /v All I care about is Akira? Wasn't Jordan supposed to direct it? /v Stop making race films black people!!! It's all trauma /v Fuck lee he's a hater trash /v ah what a shame, Peele almost had a chance at becoming a huge director, too bad now his career will become shit after working with Spike Lee and he'll be typecast as that one black guy who only hires black people for his films. /v Sounds sad that spike has to do a collabo wit this nigga to seem relevant \n\nSpike been on blk awareness since .....\n\n\nWell his whole career /v After chiraq im done with spike /v sike lee is garbage. jordan peele shouldnt be working with anybody and he should stop race baiting /v I don't mind peele but I'm kinda iffy on spike lee, I really want Jordan to get another major W /v Waiting for people to have something smart to say, ppl like to throw Spike under the bus but I feel like he's always try to uplift black ppl in his art /v LeAve spike Lee out of it none of us forgot about Chiraq  /v Spike lee boutta fuck up the movie /v Hope peele doesn't lose credibility getting involved making a movie with spike Lee since chiraq is trash /v i didnt know get out was gonna have a sequel /v Have a nice day!

I predict a major hit for her! /v Taeyeon brought me here because of her insta story I LOVE THIS! /v Yes and damb she got fatter..but still hot I guess /v Is Kelly's body actually big in the US? I just Googled that the average dress size in the US is 16. I'm not familiar with American sizes, but what is her dress size estimate? I don't get why her being big is a problem but I'm just curious why lots of people make a big deal out of it. /v i am so sorry kelly. i am huge fan of you but this is not mind-blowing /v She got sth in common wit Britney, luv both of them :* /v what note did she hit at 2:15 thats so high this woman is legendary /v I don't know how I feel about this... /v I always love you, Kelly! /v This is one catchy song and I love it! Kelly welcome back baby girl. /v Fell in love with the song! Now I'm in love with the video! Slay Kelly! /v This is the kind of woman who is in the industry every young girl should look up to. Always a fan of her music and her as a person  #lovesosoft /v YES KELLY CLARKSON IS BACK I don't care Kelly Clarkson  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com* /v Yellow suits her a lot /v WOW WOW WOW!!!!  KELLY YOU ARE SOOO AMAZING...LOVE THE NEW VIDEO IT'S BEYOND AWESOME!!!\nBJ BROOKS /v I watched the video & think it is awesome. Her voice is amazing! Way to go Kelly, well done  Saddens me that so many people are so rude & only focused on her body. Maybe they only watched to body shame...why don't they try again if her body bothers them with their eyes closed. JS /v Kelly is back. 90's are back! This song is damn good, bitch! No need sex, booty, etc. To show how music good is. Breakaway kelly! Haha /v OMGGGGGGGG I LOVE HERRRR SOOOO MUCH. I love a curvy woman who still can rock her confidence in any clothes. Kelly, you still have that voice OMGGGGGG lady, come by singapore, have a acoustic session with few fans and i'll be there. :) Love so softtttt /v Omfg people stop complaining about Kelly's weight ...\n1.she just had 2 kids within the last few years and it might take her longer to get that off. \n2.she is a singer /songwriter not a fucking model. \n3.just because she's not a size 0 does not mean she does not have issues Kelly has even spoken in the past that she has had weight problems and its always been an up and down thing with her .\nStop acting like you are perfect , if you don't like it then go watch someone's else's video , Kelly has many fans who care about her and does not need judgemental people. /v People keep talking about how obesity isn't healthy...but models starving themselves and throwing their food up is something we praise? To contribute to what we call body goals???? Smh. /v I watch because taeyeon instastory but honestly this song so so good /v Kelly was born with a fat Black gospel singing woman in her heart. That girl can SANG! I love this and I'm so glad she's owning her full figure - she's ALWAYS beautiful. /v She is the only current successful artist that has come out of american idol it is amazing n she was season one winner. she had two kids bac to bac n Reba is her step mother in law. She is happy n thats all that matters not her weight! She is very talented! /v I love how the backup singers actually have representation in the video. /v Its saddens me to once again see so much negativity towards Kelly and her weight.  She's so beautiful inside and out.  Why does anyone feel the need to say such things???  When Kelly looks back on her life she will see nothing but love despite her father.  What will you see?  Someone that leads a negative life with judgement, /v WOW! \nAmazing and beautiful... I Love it!  /v wtf..... she looks awful and the song is garbage... /v I'm very like this song that I listen to this every day. /v Yes im sure her fat rolls are soft /v I voted for Kelly on American Idol in 2002!! Always my fav /v 2017 has been such a great year for music /v She should ease up on the makeup. She looks like a clown. Looks like she has lost weight though. Good for her. /v starting today i will be addicted to this song till i die!! /v Wow the architect of that house /v Omg amazing song and video  queen is back finally  /v This reminds of Nelly Say it right for some reason /v WHAT??? THIS SONG AND SPECIALLY KELLY CLARKSON! DESERVES MORE VIEWS!!!! /v Yes!

Whooo weeee, sing it Kelly! /v Have questions for us?! Ask them over on Super Carlin Gaming! /v i bet newt is hagrid's father /v I always wondered\nWhat was hagrid's house when he was a student /v YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR INTRO /v Caffeine. His shirt is the molecular structure of caffeine. /v Answer. He got another wand....... Harry's wand broke. He just used another wand. I'm sure Dumbledore was able to pull some strings and get him and somewhat ok wand. /v Try connect all HP theories in one vid. Do they line up? I have no idea  /v Wait wasn't Hagrid in his third year when he was expelled? Shouldn't that have made him 13, not 15? Or did he start school at a later age? /v personally i like the thought that Hagrid is just accidentally amazing at wandless magic.\n\nMagic is all about intent. Because Hagrid THINKS he wand still works, it does.\n\nBit silly yeah but i find it amusing /v why was hagrids wand snapped in the first place? newt was expelled for basically the same reason, and his wand is fine. /v So I haven't read the books and I was wondering, can magic users do magic without wands? /v What I always wondered; what did Lilly see in Severus? /v Newt should have been Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts  /v This is an amazing theory and I really hope you're right. I would love to see Hagrid under Newt's tutelage. It would create a perfect connection to everything. /v Yea, right... But damn, I need that Slotherin pillow so bad!! /v The books tell you what happened this isn't necessary /v I literally didn't even notice the umbrella was pink... /v Ben, caffeine belongs in your coffee not on your shirt. Lol /v Hey! Did you guys know that sir Cadogan (or whatever) CAN actually be spotted in the prisoners of azkaban(movie) when the fat lady portrait is broken. You guys should make a video about it! /v My question is why do they even have umbrellas in the wizarding world in the first place. In fantastic beasts we see them use a spell to produce an ubrella and fantastic beasts is a PREquel. So the fact that his umbrella does nothing and that his umbrella can produce an umbrella baffles me. /v  *mind blown*\nYou have No idea how happy watching this video made me. It filled in so many blanks n got me super pumped for Fantastic beasts!!! \nUr awesome! /v Please tell me the truth about OLAF in FROZEN /v in case you didn't know there is a place in Switzerland called Grindelwald. just if you wanted that, then your welcome. however if you already knew it then... just checking. /v How is Hagrid fifteen when he is in his third year? 3:54 /v Why do we never see any magical patronus animals throughout the series? We see a phoenix from Dumbledore, but how come no students or teachers have magical creature patroni? /v This is a great theory and I definitely hope we will get to see the duel in the movies, hopefully in the last one, but you have made one mistake, or rather not explained an apearent mistake by the books. If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldnt even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY! /v You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers /v Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it. /v If anything remotely close to this makes it's way into the fantastic beasts franchise, you should get paid. /v Cool theory, but unfortunately you don't know transfiguration. First of all, no matter how good the transfigurator is, the transfigured object can't stay in the new form forever, sooner or later it'll change back. Second of all, magic objects are non-transfigurable. /v Am I the only one who says duel like dew-e-l not dool /v This is a great theory!!!! /v thats truly a great and exciting theory !!! /v I got a cherry wood wand, 14 and a half inches, phoenix core. I'm quite happy with it. =) /v Assuming that it is Rex, can you do a video about how he ended up in Wall-E's collection? It could make quite the sad story. /v Have you ever thought that your theories are correct until you post a video out the theory? Exec producer: Well we can't use that idea any more because someone just figured it out. /v can you please please please do a video about how tom riddle wasn't an obscurial!!!!!!! /v I was wondering do you reckon a basilisk would make an appearance in fantastic beasts and where to find them /v I want this to be true so bad /v Also a friend of mine ask me this how is cars born  after watching cars3 /v I used to really like these videos and then realised then I that you just use the material right off pottermore.... /v I love this theory!!! /v You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella. /v I remember the yellow ball with the star on it, I remember seeing it in a show I used to watch. I just can't pinpoint which episode it is. Which show is it from? /v To SCB's defense, i saw Seamus' video 2 weeks ago and the theories are not exactly the same. I think it's a coincidence that they made videos about similar topics and I seriously doubt they would watch Seamus' video and purposely take the idea. Seamus talked more about how Dumbledore might have mentored Hagrid and SCB talked more about his wand and how it would've been fixed and predicting his role in the next Fantastic Beasts movie. Y'all are getting upset over something that's not a huge issue. I hope they come out and say something. /v Maybe Newt is a relative of Hagrid somehow? /v the real question is who should play Hagrid\npersonally i say The Mountain from Game of Thrones /v Do you hear that? I think it's the sound of all of your viewers minds simultaneously\nexploding! /v Hey Brother ! I need to presentate myself for my class. I'm a nerd and I think the most of us here (what is awesome). I was searching on YouTube, but I couldn't find a really good clip of it. So I thought that you could explain in a clip how awesome and cool it is to be a nerd.thumbs if you want to see this happen.And please comment on this. /v Ok. Ready. Harry didn't get the elder wand from Draco. But he got it in the cave from the half blood prince. When Harry makes dumbledore drink the potion that makes him relive his worst memory. He drop his wand /v When I was young I thought Hagrid was weird for hanging out with little kids but now that I'm older he has become my favorite character. I wish he was my friend lol /v i wish the cc did not fill the whole screen. /v Love this theory guys, I hope the theory appears to be true in the upcoming FB movies. /v Hi Love this video  I have an amazing idea for a new series that you should both watch Once Upon A Time which is on Netflix  /v Hagrid was 13/14 when expelled. Not 15. He was a third year. So unless he was held back... /v Harry didn't win elder wand from voldemort... he won from draco malfoy /v If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99) how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^ /v It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand. /v Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way /v I just thought that Dumbledore secretly fixed Hagrid's wand with the elder wand because he knew that Hagrid had nothing to do with the incidents. /v I just realized Quidditch teams could just go to the room of requirement and get a bunch of steroids and firebolts. /v If your names not j k Rowling hen your theory is bs! And her and warner bros sue any one who tries to monetise off of Harry Potter /v What a cool theory I hope this is right /v Fantastic theory! I really hope it's right /v Are you guys Christians /v omg this my first vid watching a vid of yours in 2017 /v I've thought Dumbledore repaired hayride wand for a long time /v what house was Hagrid in? /v 3:58 Wasn't Hagrid expelled in his 3rd year? I'm pretty sure he stated in the first book that he was expelled in his third year. /v I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character. /v As much as I like Hagrid, and as horrible as it was that Hagrid got blamed for Myrtle Warren's death, I agree with his expulsion because he did have a dangerous monster in the castle, even if it wasn't the one causing the attacks. Acromantulas eat humans, and having one in a school... yeah, Hagrid deserved to be expelled and should never have been a teacher. /v Harry did not win it from Voldemort. He won it from Draco Malfoy /v That would make so much sense /v Pausing at 42 seconds.\n\nDumbledore it's alwayse deus ex dumbledore.\n\nI so hope I right making this WAG. /v I came up with this theory like 2 years ago I mean you just had to connect the dots in the books. /v But if newt has already beaten grindlewald with his beasts could that mean newt is the master of the elder wand and neither Harry or dumbledore have ever been the masters /v Could you do another zootopia video? /v OI!

He was very good. Very factual no drama, no apocalypse I appreciate this kind of reporting. /v Hi, from Ecuador en South America /v he is the best /v I would like to replicate this man for ALL local news anchors and broadcast meteorologists. Wouldn't it be awesome to get education from news like this guy gives? Way to go weatherman! /v Amazing that this video went viral not because there was some massive fuck up, not because something hilarious happened, but simply because this guy is so damn good at his job. /v I don't know why people are freaking out saying this is so amazing. This is like every severe weather report I've ever seen anywhere. /v This Guy is Handsome. /v Im lucky he's my local newscaster /v R.I.P Gulf of Mexico. Continental drift to 2017.\nAfter watching the whole video I realized how amazing this dude is at his job. I would rather have him on every news channel than those fake people with the 10 pounds of makeup and those ugly smiles hat make then look like clowns. /v Wish ALL news was reported in such a straight forward and scientific fashion. No opinion or innuendos. /v I'm going to offer a Pepsi to stop this hurricane. Guys gimme some time /v Dis nigga be all true and shit bout da wehtha!

I'm glad that he's getting this wide recognition because it is much deserved. /v And the mainstreaming media was saying that we have never had so many hurricanes together and this chief meteorologist shows proof that we have had a lot like this in the past. /v Alan Sealls is his name! What a great, informative piece of weather reporting! Really like this guy! /v Alan Sealls, You Could Sell a Pot of Steam Babay  Highly Knowledgeable and Well Spoken,\n#TheGreatElucidator /v Alan just came thru with the word  very thorough /v I'm dead for sure....i flippin live in MIAMI !! NEAR THE BEACH WITH A SMALL DANG HOUSE I'M FUCKED FOR SURE >:( /v Said like a true professional, Alan. Very clear and informative and CLASSY. Wish you were in my viewing area. Much success to you. /v this was incredible!!! I learned a lot, it was well detailed and now I understand why hurricanes can change course over time  /v I hope he becomes the next Al Roker, because Al was always a bit of a putz and this guy is an incredible science communicator. So many people need to hear the news like this again. Maybe then, people would stop thinking every damn thing is a conspiracy, but I doubt it. /v This reminds me of watching the news when I was a little kid. Before everyone had cable, internet and phones we were much more pragmatic as a whole. /v 1:08 Now, the models don't control the weather. Only an American weather forecaster would have to explain that to his audience. /v Incredible, simply one of th easiest and best foecasts /v I love how he assumes that we might think his weather models could control the weather. He says it multiple times. That's why this vid went viral. /v THE best explanation of the current hurricane situation I've yet seen. Thanks to Mr. Sealls for a sober, clearly-articulated presentation. /v OMG what a fabulous forecaster!  Mr. Sealls is the 'only' weather forecaster in my 73 years of life who has not used severe weather to spread unnecessary fear and anxiety throughout the land only so that he accumulates ratings.  He is extremely factual and informative with the calmness necessary to assure viewers that they need to be aware and take his information seriously due to the fact that this hurricane is very destructive.  He should be made a national forecaster immediately because of his calm demeanor and factual content without scaring the bejesus out of people, especially old people such as myself.  I want to thank him for being the BEST WEATHER FORECASTER - BAR NONE. /v ALAN SEALLS IS A LEGEND /v i like how this is basically a weather lesson ... \nand the fact that he has to emphasize the projection doesn't control the weather is just hilarious cus it shows how many people think the forecast is THE route the hurricane will take LOL /v Trump paid irma to attack the us so he can take pr pics /v Dude is the first weather dude that is clear in this explanation. /v This man is the best weatherman and meteorologist I have ever seen /v might as well get rid of Florida /v I said it before and I'll say it again........ This is gods way of saying that you have to have state income tax. /v The ONLY weatherman to watch /v bitch i live in hernando county just north of its suspected landfall fucking help shit shit shit /v Hurricanes, Tornado Warnings, Tsunami Warnings and Earthquake Warnings.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end is near /v THE WORLD IS GOING TO END /v The bible says that at the end weird things will happen on the earth reade Luke 21:25-27 if you done believe me read. This is a sign from God along with all the hurricanes to get right with God. You have been told the truth you can either accept or reject but both ways you know it's true /v This is the eye of the storm, can you say that? E-Y-E of the storm? Sure, I knew you could! I love this guy! /v Alan Sealls is a geography prodigy. /v Finally someone who can stand against USA! /v The solar eclipse was something huh? /v Ok there was some hurricane drama here irma and hurrvy where dating they broke up and katiea was with harrvy irma got mad then jose said dont leave me irma i love u then maria said wait jose.. i love u come back jose. Seee  credits to -Me my dad and my aunt who made this story up. /v So many gays and lesbians in America . Now god I think is punishing them. /v Thank you, Alan, for your down to earth explanation of hurricane Irma and the path she may take. Your calm demeanor emits calm and confidence. /v Best. Weatherman. Ever. /v The man. The myth. The legend. /v It said 666. Big enough for the world to see at once. Kthulu rises from the sea. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n.badass. /v This gentleman is superb and a master at his craft! I was actually fascinated and engrossed in his presentation. My compliments and thanks for his enlightening instruction! /v Mfers runnin a train on us /v Thumbs up for Alan :) /v he is good /v I live south Florida \n\n\n\nwow Irma /v Wow great explanation sir . /v vandamme /v 9/11 tomorrow. /v More niggers talking /v Another one and another one /v Haarp /v very lowkey like hurricanes /v Is it Gunna hit Houston /v Imagine Irma and Jos combining /v Go Alan! /v Guy gives it straight, no bullshit. /v Omg  https://youtu.be/JYKWUR-hb08 /v Damn, Adam Sealls. Great job /v Aye he reps my state!! /v D: Fujiwhara Effect /v ALAN SEALLS THE DEAL #ALANSEALLSTHEDEAL /v Good weatherman!  Excellent explanation. Delivered the facts. /v *hurricane harvey* Me: wow..I hope they are safe\n\n*hurricane irma* Me: Aw jeez. \n\n*hurricane Jose* Me: wtf America \n\n*hurricane Katia* Me: wELP /v Irma is cheating on Harvey /v Brilliant teacher. /v I really like this guy.  If I am not mistaken he is out of Mobile, (my hometown).  I wish he were my local weatherman here in North Carolina.  Of course he belongs on The Weather Channel as their chief meteorologist. /v I live in Houston not in Florida they got prepared and we didn't we went through a whole bunch of shit Florida not really  y'all just saw what went down in Houston and got y'all asses prepared before HIT  y'all we some some somesoldiers WE STILL STANDING STRONG!!! /v all niggers belong in the zoo\nexcept this guy. he's alright /v this song reminds me of an end of year school dance I've never gone /v Me gusta mucho su musica /v Is it just me or the first part sounds a lot like we belong together? /v Here before 1 million views Squad???? /v  /v Baby makin' music /v enjoyed it  /v Before a million peeps.. /v Love this album /v  /v La bamba vibes! <3 /v omg,love the retro style,,nice sound. /v  /v 50s vibe /v Beautiful song...it /v YESSS this is so amazing /v flesh illustrate existence shine philosophy prosecution compensation tall leaf /v Beautiful  song  dear /v doo wop remake /v LOOOVVVVVEEEEE /v Here before 200k views /v msica linda ! /v ok....

But each one is a different beat etc. He's good for being so young. Maybe he inherited part of his talent from his dad. All I know is that I listen to all of the songs everyday. /v I love the old school Doo Wop=esque feel of this song.\n\nIt's a real throw back, stylistically, and it reminds me so much of the type of songs that were on the Grease and Dirty Dancing soundtracks. /v This kinda sounds like Christmas music /v I looooooove the old school vibe this song has! /v anyone who sub me i am sub him back /v If I ever have the pleasure of settling down with a good woman, this will be played at our wedding. /v THIS is the kind of music that needs to make a comeback!!! That classic, intimate, Doo Wop style sound!!! Props to you, Rhett!! /v I love everything about this ! What can't this man do ?! /v I see he likes Ritchie Valens music, considering the background beat is identical to We belong together not knocking it, I love the song. Just admiring his taste /v I can name a thousand songs that sound just like this  /v Back to the 50s and 60s....Love it..... /v love how you're making my blood sugar rise the only part that doesn't make sense to me. (yes I know what it means when your blood sugar rises, but still.) /v reminds me of a man once I lost /v OMG!! I LOVE THIS SONG! PUT IT ON THAT RADIO BRO!!! /v Let guess... Its wify again hahhah... Where is the other hot country girl? Its like were watching the same apple tree every music video of you. Not good anymore. /v Is it me or 50% of Country singers of today don't sound Country-ish ? :( /v The struggle of wanting to listen to this song all day long but also not wanting to overplay it /v LOVE THIS SONG!!!!

I guess the entire budget for this movie went to Matt Damon and paying off youtube to put this in trending. /v (Christ answers Judas. If you love Jesus you WILL keep his sayings/Commandments.):\n\nJudas saith unto him, \n(not Iscariot),\n\nLord, \nhow is it that thou \nwilt manifest thyself unto us, \nand not unto the world?\nJesus answered \nand said unto him,\n\nIf a man (love me), \nhe (will) (keep my words): \nand my (Father) will (love him), \nand we will (come unto him), \nand make our (abode with him).\n\nHe that (loveth me not) \n(keepeth) (not my sayings):\nand the word which ye hear \nis not mine, \nbut the Father's \nwhich sent me.\n\n(John 14:22-24).\n\n***(Loves me...keep my word): In response to Judas's question, Jesus explained that his manifestation to the disciples would be in response to their love and obedience.\n\n***(Make our home with him): If a believer loves and obeys the Lord, he or she will experience fellowship with God.\n\n***(Not love...not keep): If a person does not love Jesus, he or she will not obey him. Disobedience is a serious matter for Jesus words are the words of God!\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Jesus will manifest himself unto you, if you LOVE HIM by KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ):\n\nAt that day\nye shall know that\n\nI am in my Father, \nand ye in me, \nand I in you.\n\nHe that hath my commandments,\nand keepeth them,\nhe it is that loveth me:\nand he that loveth me\nshall be loved of my Father,\nand I will love him,\nand will manifest myself to him.\n\n(John 14:20-21).\n\n***As the believer lovingly OBEYS Christ Commandments, he or she will experience a more intimate knowledge of Him. /v George Clooney is a cunt. Expect massive boycotting. Believe me. /v a tone deaf movie that will continue to set back race relations. /v A7X Rules! /v I really like this.... thanks for releasing, it makes me happy /v what is the brand of m.shadows cap that appears at the beginning of the video? /v Nice to see them continually evolving and growing. That's something that The Rev would have loved. He was always trying/doing new things and helped pushed them in a lot of new directions.  For the people complaining about this, this is what AV7X has always done. It's not all always metal. You haven't been paying attention if you're just realizing this now. Brooks Wackerman seems to be a big help in their continued growth. No disrespect to Arin Ilejay, a monster drummer who stepped in when they needed him most but I was worried it wouldn't last. His inexperience and lack of a broad musical background would make it hard.  Plus that was a very hard and trying time for Avenged. This too is probably part of the healing process. /v They covered  the rolling stones /v Syn has a fuckin beautiful voice <3 & with Matt are an awesome duo!! the whole band did an awesome job! Beautiful Song <3 Love you guys!! Greetings from Costa Rica (*''*) /v Is Matt wearing a McDonald's hat?lol /v Nice cover guys miss the grunting but it is really gooood /v Anyone else hyped by the Chris Jericho cameo in the video?? /v I am a big fan of a7x for years, i enjoyed this cover but you know... i do miss city of evil, avenged sevenfold, diamonds in the rough etc. This sounds great but paradigm, nightmare, 2nd heartbeat will always be missed and remembered /v Beatles cover please /v Will be good if the rev still there /v Is that chris jericho(y2j) at 2:31?? /v When are You coming to indonesia? /v I am getting a REO speedwagon vibe here,agree?? /v this is really music:') /v why a7x dont do metal songs now? /v after watching 1 min of video my modem went offline, i had to go to my friend's house just to finish the video. /v The kid still hits harden than Lars! /v These guys grew up. I like it. /v I really love to be part to this family  #DeathbatFamily /v W h o l e s o m e /v This song is sooo touching my heart /v go to the portugal please I miss them /v This video clearly confirms this: \n\nJohnny Christ is the leader of Avenged Sevenfold. Johnny Christ writes all the songs. Without Johnny Christ, Avenged Sevenfold would be nothing.  hahaha /v i think this song about they found happiness in the end of the day. this song make me feel like im old. great chilling song. /v THE CAMEO OF JERICHO LOOK FOR ME MAAAAAAAAN /v LowKey this isn't to bad /v I think I can see now where Avenged Sevenfold is going... Nice Rolling Stones cover. Tho, I hope the new would still be as epic as The Stage. /v Awesome! imo syn sounds great acapella at the end but during the song (especially last chorus) he is overpowered by shadows to the point of sounding flat. Just my 2cents. Incredible band nonetheless and I would watch ANY cover ANY day! \n\nWhile we're on the topic of covers, it would absolutely blow my mind if a7x/m.shadows did a cover of Geoff Tate/Queensryche. Their voices are 2 of my favorites and I feel they would compliment each other beautifully. More specifically, to hear Geoff Tate cover Brompton Cocktail...no words  /v This cover is beautiful /v Holy shit!!!!, now that is bad....asss. /v What song that you sing, it always beautiful,.  /v I like the music /v I love this song ... so beautiful ! I cant stop sing and listing to it ! Thank you A7x /v Hope WB doesn't completely steamroll these guys in court.... LWYRUP /v this song makes me smile /v Lve from Myanmar /v It would be very interesting to see you guys do a cover of Live and Learn from Crush 40. Since M Shadows is a fan of gaming, and since I think the guitars sound similar, I think it would be awesome. /v I'm all about a7x moving forward amd not back words, if you want them to sound like insert album name here go listen to that record /v I love you so much! Thank you for being such an important part of my life. Come back to Brazil <3 /v At the end i thought charlie kelly was singing. King of rats! /v Christ Jericho 2:22? /v WOW i love this side of a7x i will be a fan foREVer and always love you guys xoxox /v 2:32 You just made the list! /v This sadly has nothing on the original :/ /v Is there going to be a deluxe cd of The Stage with all these bonus tracks? Because I am 100% ok with buying this amazing album again! /v The intro of the song reminds me of Ramona by Beck\n\n\nAny Scott Pilgrim fans will get it /v Ppl say bands are never the same once they make a vevo.. That statement is accurate although the 60s covers are nice to roll up to /v I hope they have some new stuff of their own coming out. /v how lucky these guys are not because of how big they got, but because the family they have there, how much of a family they are, most of the big bands fight between them and their members and end up in bad terms, these guys grew up together, married, had their children and continued being a family to this day, you can notice just by watching their reactions and their pranks that theres brothers love /v at the end when Synyster Gates dumpster the water on Johnny lol /v OMFG no one's gonna mention that Matt (Da Kurlzz) appears in minute 1:52?!  /v Such pure music! This is porn for ears! Love from India.. /v Well. I'm gonna need a minute! Poor Johnny :') /v At first I thought this was decent but after a couple listens I love how they captured the classic vibes. It's a stones cover with a hint of gnr topped with that unique A7x sound. /v I love you guys so much /v Those kids are gonna grow up to be just like their father, I hope to see that one day /v I really love it!! \nWell I'm a classic song fan /v Love it.. One of my favorite bands covering another of my favorite bands. Can't get too much better than this /v thanks a7x fbonus bonus song for fans   /v Amazing /v 30 second ads I cant skip youtube know just what I want /v why do i hate vevo so much /v ... all of their songs been cheesy so lately to me /v Avenged Sevenfold....is... Jericho!! /v Johnnys! Beard!! Mmm! Yes!!!,,,,,!!! Good /v HOUSE M.D. anyone?! /v Congrats Avenged /v Rollvenged Sevenstones :) /v this song warms my heart everytime /v A7x indonesia fans /v Subcribe back...ok /v Guns sevenfold /v Cool /v Cad os BR? /v COME TO MEXICO!!! /v Who else saw Chris Jericho? /v hi from mexico cabrones! !!!! /v shite /v The best /v Masterpiece /v Love (Hadomi) From Timor Leste... /v I love you Synyster Gates <3 /v Me encanta A7X Zacky /v Sound 's fun /v R.I.P A7x /v Fuck off /v Perfect /v 1:51 Da Kurlzz in the camo shirt /v Chris Jericho in 2:22!! /v 2:22 and 2:32 Chris Jericho :D /v Chris Jericho cameo! /v 2:32 hey its chris jericho haha /v Nice cover guys /v Y2J /v mantapp a7x... from indonesia /v Uffffff man, loved it /v I know they wanted to go in a new direction but......what is this? I love this band. Lots of their songs have helped me through some tough times but this song I can't get behind. It's like alternative rock meets country meets soft metal. /v Christ...Shadow's voice is more annoying than ever. /v WHAT IS GOOD #TeamSuper fam!?

You were talking and it was so bizarre. /v Has anyone seen that weird video of a guy who put mash potatoes on his entire face and hair?

I can't find a good white paint that doesn't go streaky and would love to try the one you use but don't know what it is! :( x /v OH MAN THE BEEHIVE IS BACK IN FASHION /v For the longest time I couldn't understand what you were saying about the products listed somewhere around the video. Like, for years! And you just now realized you mumble the whole statement. /v I've never watched American Horror Story and after this I can say I'm deffiently NOT watching American Horror Story.

You're my inspiration and I hope to be as good as you /v I don't know why but this look kinda reminds me of the little babies ice cream commercial......if you don't know what it is please look it up /v If you did an Asylum look that would bee amazing  Preferably the people who were made to live for ever like the ones with blisters and all that on them /v u are amazing /v KANEEE!

Great job. /v GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME !! THEN HE THAT IS IN THIS WORLD!!! RIGHT NOW THEIR ARE FALSE SIGNS AND WONDERS EVERYBODY  THE WEATHER IS JUST A FEAR TACTIC OF THE DEVIL  TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD IS COMING, HOWEVER THE ANTI CHRIST IS GONNA APPER BEFORE JESUS AT THE 6TH TRUMPET WHICH IS ABOUT TO SOUND!!! REPENT THERE IS VERY LITTLE TIME!!!!REPENT!!!! REPENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nREMEMBER AS FAR AS THE HURRICANES THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW \n\nTHE STORY OF JOB !!\n\nSatan was allowed to use his authority over the weather to cause an unusually powerful wind to blow down a house that resulted in the death of ALL of Job's sons and daughters (Job 1:18 - 19). He also used this power to produce fire from heaven in order kill all of Job's sheep and the servants that were tending to them (verses 16). Some commentaries believe this fire was actually lightning.\n\n\nTHERE FORE THE LYING SIGNS IS THE WEATHER!! \n\n\nREPENT REPENT REPENT !! SURRENDER TO CHRIST /v Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  So is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   Jesus Christ loves you. Thank you God bless /v If this is 'gospel' music then I'm a skinny white man. And I'm a fat black man so...... I hate to see him turn this way but the warning signs have been there for years. Literally for years! This music industry is not what people think it is. It's setting a lot of people up to fail spiritually. /v I feel this video is a bit hypocritical, he's a Christian but he's got girls wearing short shorts dancing like that? I love his music but I don't like the dancing or the clothes /v I can't keep track with their dance moves. Smotth /v I love this video /v Let's Get IT! This is Awesome! /v Super Dope! Way to go ya'll! /v You are leading the young astray. You think JESUS wants them dancing like that? /v I love this song AND I LOVE THAT SHIRT can you get that shirt somewhere?? /v Please do listen here also https://youtu.be/9QNRd23I4l0 /v The dancers should show up to my next birthday party. /v  y'all keep this up God bless /v Nothing but . Favorite song of the year, and the video was dope too! /v Where can I get one of them shirts?! /v Where can I get one of these shirts God is Dope I would be wearing it all the time #Unashamed /v Big boss moves never had a small place   /v They look like they had so much fun with this!  So much joy! Thanks for sharing your gift! /v Lecrae is dope! Also make sure u guys check out my mixtape for something new in hip-hop.  https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA /v Love love love, the energy, the song, and the vid, wish the choreography was a liiittle bit better, but other than that /v Im not really a fan of rap in general, but this, this I can do /v This might be the stupidest thing I've seen today /v I'm loving the growth and relevance. /v I like lecrae but this video sucks there not dancing to the music /v Why there is written  God is dope  /v Who's the second young lady from the left @0:56 ? i think i hear God calling /v Why doesn't he have more subs?! Like wat?!?!?! /v Disney's Shake it Up! /v & this is how they get everyone caught up. So know one sees whats goin on!?where's lacrae havin seen him in a long timethe real lacrae!!! /v Those shirts are sick... Want one for myself /v Heard this on the local rap station and I freaked  /v Start the video at 1:50 seconds, girl Goes HAM! /v Get it y'aaall! /v How many accounts does Kevin D Jimison have? lol /v How I feel when im off from work !!! Like hamemer time!!! /v Aha Gazelle would've killed this beat. /v God's People are Dope and Gifted! /v Hey,Hey HHEYYY!!!;;\nI love it thats why I'm so glad christiab rapper are making it a whole lot easier for my teen to serve the Lord and be able to do it on their level /v Thank God... For  the Dancers, Lecrae , 1k Phew, Metro Boomin' , and for everybody tuning in and the ones that's not...Lets get it!!! /v God is dopelove it ..great talent to a great song /v I love this song but this video is kinda disappointing. I was hoping for a music video of Lecrae and 1K Phew performing the song like he did with Tori Kelly and the I'll Find You video. /v Dope lyrics..dope production and delivery..all around dope video! Lecrae is a savage that stay on cheat mode beast mode all day! Fire! /v Used to be down bad. Boy... Now I'm up like... Did he?  /v I need one of those God is Dope shirts. /v Lecrae is one of the most talented rappers out right now, no matter if you care about religion or not, but this song is 100% garbage. \n\nWhy the FUCK is he making this autotune, mumble rap bullshit?? This type of music has no longevity or replay value. Stop wasting your talents bro. You're better that this. /v They can't touch me Hammertime.  /v AYE!!! We lit! Atla Entertainment Casting IV is the greatest. Thank you for the  experience Lecrae! One in a million opportunity  /v I didn't like this video, sorry.\nI like to see you Lecrae!!! Love to see you singing. /v because you put God, it's dope? /v This is so lit!!  /v God is Dope!!!!....ayeee /v I really hate this style of hip hop that has become popular in the last couple years and I resent that my favorite Christian artists seem to have fallen into this hole as well.  When rap legends are coming out being vocal about how AWFUL this style of hip hop is, perhaps artists should listen instead of mass-producing this boring auto-tuned garbage. /v J vou ver mil vezes, pra aprender logo  /v Ficou zuada muito seco o beat tem que ter armonia /v AWESOME I LOVE LECRAE /v GOD IS DOPE *but got on couchie cutters* /v What is this 2012?? Christian or not that dancing has never been cool. /v Like SHHEEESH /v awesome /v BRAZILLLL LOVES YOU <3 /v Looks like flexin /v KEEP SLAYING DAWG /v Lil kida choreography?  /v Yeaah. Its Hammer time! Love me some Lecrae! /v https://youtu.be/iu0orqfyv8M /v Atlanta?! My city  /v GOD IS REALLY DOPE /v Clean! /v kiiiiilllllllin itttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v God is dope /v WTF happen to lecrae? he fall off? /v God I'd Dope indeed /v Yay /v yo its hammer time /v Editing was nice /v I want this t-shirt   /v Song is lit /v I've been waiting /v https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7LCnjUxBTts /v  /v God is dope. /v God Is Dope! /v It finally came /v GOD IS DOPE! /v Dat bass doe(insert fire emoji) /v  /v sigan aai impactan el mundo con la msica /v is God a dope?? lecrea music now is for making money not like before his music used to touch the lost soul  /v I'm Christian, but I can easily say that about 99.9% of Christians who listen to music are trippin. If music boring, then it isn't Christian according to most Christians. People like to say lecrae sold out and that he isn't Christian anymore just because he's starting to make fun music. I honestly don't get why ya'll cant just enjoy the music. /v DOPE!!! Thank you Lecrae for looking out for the dance artists too!!!\ncheck out our Jr Squad video to Hammer Time on our page. let us know what yaw think\nhttps://youtu.be/4PR3D2QiJHk /v Lecrae you broke my heart u came from gospel rap to being a God gold digger u now do it for the money u were my favorite /v GOD IS DOPE.....AND SO IS THIS VIDEO!!!!   Need these young people to teach me those moves:-) /v Really??? I like the somg and it has a good message but u cant call God dope. Thats disrespectful /v that is not the s8 plus but just the s8 /v Anyone know if they are going to release the larger internal storage capacity versions in Europe? /v Maybe wait for the note 10 /v resolution is for vr........simple as that..... /v wait a min.. you have kids? /v The music you put in this video is aids. The volume is just quiet enough to make it obnoxious. /v Still, if you don't need the S-pen easy pick, S8+ is 350 euro's cheaper /v I'll just stay here with my c9 pro /v chinese fans want to see xiaomi mix2 /v still love my note 4... upgrading time might take the S8 plus. really dont use the pen that much. /v Now what? Even this clown is reviewing phones? He basically collected all negative side of it and made a video.\nListen, S-Pen has more precision then a finger. Ask people who used it since the original Note. People do a lot other stuff with it, not just to open apps.\nIf your finger is so small that you don't need an S-Pen. Most of us find it useful. \nFunny when a pc builder review phones. He hated the phone before he even put one on his hand. Just search the August 23rd video when he's with other reviewers. /v I am not going to pay over 500 $ for that tho... /v 5:09 I just realized that I might be racist. /v i have a note 4 and its still the best one they made, 4k pictures, never lags, removable battery, 64gb sd card + 32gb hdd, no bixby and some come pre-rooted, its great :P /v I love this new style of review video you put out, Linus. :D /v It has a smaller battery but many people have uploaded videos showing the Note 8 out performing many other phones including the S8+. \nEveryone has been hating on Bixby but I was blown away after seeing a Siri, Google and Bixby comparison. Bixby is smart and is growing more intelligent every day. /v you should stick to computer/it tech rather than phones,,,\nps:dislike for using you friend unfortunate event Austin Evans as a joke or what you thought would be funny.... /v bxActions still works to remap really well. I have it set as a flashlight button. /v Thank you for the honest review, instead of just jumping on the band wagon and saying it's awesome. I have a Note 5 and much prefer it over the Note 8. Samsung also downgraded the camera by 4MP. Note 5 has a 16MP camera! That curved displays are just plain stupid, makes it way easier to break. /v OLED, AMOLED, Super AMOLED, Super AMOLED HD - I just wish they had a universal language - this is the first time in years I have heard a Samsung screen be called OLED - most recently the LG V30 - if its AMOLED just say AMOLED why confuse the words jezzus /v Well, the Dual Sim is a pretty big deal for some people :) /v Soon you'll praise the iphone 8 for no reason ... /v They are not gonna change everything for you. At the end of the day it's their phone.  They keep the s pen cause that's the main purpose of the phone and to have big specs..not battery. What do you expect if it does it almost all? And they aren't gonna do everything right away. They did pretty damn good, you aren't getting good speakers right away so calm down, they had other things that were needed more. /v Wow this sad af just buy a s8 /v Nice implimentation of Austin's burned flat :'D /v I want this phone just to make masterpieces in snapchat /v Something about this review doesn't feel genuine... /v I have hands as small as Donald Trump /v Did you just wink at me sir? /v Now I dnt find something unique in ur videos bro ,,,,  use to be fun to watch ur video /v Almost $1000?  I could buy like 500 Amazon Fire Phones for that. /v Love your work sir.. been watching you for years now. /v Dam was this a note 8 bashing I'm glad when I received mine I love it, and didn't listen to some of yall reviewer's /v I'm confused... what wouldn't you give up 200mA hours of battery life for, the S-PEN?   That's nuts.   200mA is insignificant compared to the value the S-PEN brings to the device. /v You are tooo harsh on Note 8 \nSpecially when it has all the features which even Flagship phones don't \n. \nThat way you should roast normal phones \nI don't see you harsh on normal phones /v Adjust my grip and start writing? What? Dude you sound like a female OMG! Just whining and whining and whining WTF dude! I dont care about Apple or Samsung I'm just saying you nip picked your ass off on this one brother! Oh & there was no Note 7 recall remember?? Soooooo???? Just saying man. /v I fucking want it /v Wait what?! Linus can 540 kick? O.o well done sir! /v Too much knit picking dude. As an all in one gadget. I think this one tops it ! /v I'm sick of dbrand ads /v Note 8 has long lasting battery due to its software optimization /v Is that a set or green screen? /v Not an impressive review, but then again opinions are what makes the world go-around I guess. If you can replace the s pen with your finger, boy I would love to see that one...lol. The dual camera is a plus for me, IMO. Too much clownish batter Linus,  but then again some people like to be entertained....You missed this one Linus, thumbs down! /v Hahaha you are very funny... very bad video... you tried to much to make this video... dislike of course /v I like the Note line but this #8. Way crazy over priced IMHO. I also think the S8 is over priced as well. These phones have just gotten too expensive over the years. /v Holy cow your entire staff has tiny hands. I'm a 17 year old Asian kid. I'm average height and weigh under 130. My note 8 (got it a week early thanks Best Buy) is perfectly sized for fingerprint. So either I have big hands or you have Trump hands. /v Linus, you are like the morning dosage of caffeine I can't get through my day without it. We love you, we need you, we are addicted, don't you dare quitting on us! :) /v Wait....Squeeze input? You've held the U11 then! /v Fuck. The price fucked this up. This video ALMOST made me buy this phone. /v What's with the two sexually ambivalent Asian dudes? /v Linus....I personally respect your unbiased option.  I appreciate the review and I wont be upgrading for a few gimmicks /v Small penis /v Trash talker!!!! /v Im fucking crying at that gta 5 mod.. /v no RBG lighting /v Definitely should've been 6 inch. Fail Samsung. /v cant find sRGB on mine! /v This phone needs @ungripyourphone /v Austin's house burnt /v shut the fuck up! /v Don't you think holding a movie in your hand is a bit of a stretch? /v The part when the note 7 was a sticky bomb in gta was funny /v Your reviews suck !  did not even heard any tech specs /v Mmm galaxy note pro 12.3 or something like that.... not that good at maths but I think that means that the screen is bigger /v 0:07 wth, i did not know that Linus could do crap like this /v My mom has a s8 and the finger print was weird  at first but after 2 days it was normal and weird for me when I use my s7 egde /v I was told that if you play a YouTube video on note 8, it won't be in the full screen! It will be the same size as Iphone plus. Is that true?!! /v I prefer the Note 8 because i don't really like the curved screen on the S8+. Otherwise it's basically the same as the S8+. Think i wasted my money but whatever /v Remember IPhone Users... if it wasn't for Samsung deleting the home button, there wouldn't be a Iphone 8 /v can't ask for more, this phone is perfect\nfor the artist, jot an idea or painting everywhere or even serious work with a smartphone are great,\nbut other manufacturer didn't even take a glimpse on bringing the digitizer stylus to smartphone\n\nI didn't even ask for that dual camera and that zoom\nbut the idea of jot some semi-professional photography idea straight from the phone are like a Christmas gift\n\npeople are bullying the idea of having an active digitizer on a smartphone,\nbut just respect it, many people are willing to pay 1000$ and more just because the idea of getting productive everywhere, /v Still can't wait for the Pixel 2 /v I agree with Linus!  I have the s8 .I say Samsung should just add an s pen and dual camera to it. And put some stereo speakers too! There's  nothing special about the note 8 except that's it's as big as a buiding. I need to also say Bixby sucks . /v 0:06, does linus have martial arts experience? /v Just don't buy the phone /v    18+  http://tinyurl.com/y78nxrsz /v Bring back Note 7 _Kreygasm_ /v J /v Now THIS is the type of content I want to see; serious, but with a hint of humor, no flashy stupid milenial memes across the screen, and an organized point-by-point format with comparisons to past hardware.  WELL DONE.  If you can keep this up I'd be happy. /v I don't care mate, I'm getting the phone because it's a better Note 4 and I love the Note 4. Simple math mate. /v Wanna hear a samsung galaxy note 8 joke?\n\n\n\n\n\nthe price.... /v 1:32 kiss shot acerola orion heart under blade /v Hahhahaha Bixby doesn't recognize iPhone /v Garbage review. /v (1) In-Screen-Fingerprint Scanner tech (2) Dual Stereo Speakers, etc. /v Awesome ! /v    18+  http://tinyurl.com/y7mnafgz /v Small hands means small cock lmfao /v Iron much? /v Nice kick Linus /v Under 600k views club. /v Get ready for huawei mate 10 /v 5:09 *close eyes* /v So basically an S8++ /v $1300 CAD. Haha, what a rip. /v If Samsung is gonna take away removable battery, then at least give us a bigger one! /v Remember when most of those idiots out here didn't want a Note phone because it was too big? Now everybody wants a big phone. People don't know what the hell they want. Linus just sounds confused. Why is everyone in comparing the note 8 To a phone which most people do not have because they were waiting for the note 8? nobody's going to basically downgrade just for a little bit of battery life. Bullshit review /v Already ordered both my Note 8(with Note 7 owner discount WOOOO) and a fresh mahogany DBrand skin to go with it. Cant wait to mail them this S7 Edge and be rid of it forever. /v And I'm still here with the Galaxy Grand Prime, Samsung's first x64 phone. /v bro u r iphone fan so dont try to compare it with iphone7 plus /v Quit hating on the phone. The Note 8 is super dope. I have it, and it's great! /v Hii, sorry to bother but I've just uploaded my very first video, if you want to watch it https://youtu.be/NbrGWnJb5lo thaaanks  /v noone ever likes to tell where they get super low deals. so here, ill share mine\nwww.dealbubbleinc.com and some of the prices are negotiable if you contact them. make sure u share the blessing! /v What brand/style of lashes are you wearing? love it soooo much! /v Your makeup is different.

Please bring back the old R3hab /v I make interesting cartoons and I need your help! Go to the channel, rate my work! /v When my cat was still a few months old, we had to give her milk (the milk they sell in pet shops) because she couldn't drink water... she tried to, but since the water is transparent, she couldn't see where it was and she would always end up shoving her head inside the water and run away ahahah... damn, she was so cute... /v Fact No.1 THEY ARE OUR INTERNET OVERLORDS /v ...was that a Quake I sound... /v        ? /v NEVER adopt a kitty only 6 or 7 weeks old!!!! They should be at least 10 or even better 12 weeks old before separated from their mother. They still get nursed  and need the socializing with their mother and siblings until then.\n\nI think it's horrible that this 6 two 8 weeks advise is given here. /v my little sister nude https://yadi.sk/d/MNh4E8vU3MkqG7 password sexy /v  ?\n,   . /v I've rescued three! Two when they were kittens (12+ years ago) and a rehomed cat, 1-2 years old (the previous owner couldn't remember exactly how old he was...)\n\nI remember getting my kittens. My other cat had died a year earlier and I missed having a cat so much. My mom would drive us to the Humane Society every week to check for kittens. The third week they were there! A little older than I was expecting (12-14 weeks), but the Humane Society probably waited to put them up for adoption until they were a little older.\nI'm definitely a cat person. They're awesome. /v Subscribe To My channel for the Coolest Vids!!! ill return /v Wait. You mean i have to feed it regularly. /v I'm surprised this channel has not died yet.\nGoodjob /v Poor Kittie /v My arch enemies. /v 1:37 fuck you pines /v Nicky  /v I love this!  /v Soo cute!!!! /v TRENDING!!! :D /v Somebody is jalou! /v Uh oh. Someone is jealous! /v I think it might be interesting to see a video with Nicky talking about why cats sit in boxes drawn on the floor sometime. Hopefully she's got some idea ... /v I wanna! D= /v  /v Mew. /v Lol hehh lol ! /v zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz /v lol, I love cats and I love this channel  <3 /v *_ahihi_*  /v  /v  /v Socks is adorable! /v thank you...lol /v My dad actually got a kitten! OMG! /v Best cartoon ever. Keep em coming the best you can. So adorable. I've watched every single episode so far. 10/10 /v Could you please please please do a video on preparing your cat for a newborn baby coming home? I'm so worried how my cat's going to react when I have my baby in a couple weeks  /v I have A Question. One of my cats (female) is in heat. And I have another Female cat who has started following her Around. What does that mean? /v MMMMM FUCK  HORNY AF?  OOOOO SHIT FUCK MEE TILL I CUM AND JERK OFF ..FUCK MEVIEW MEHURRYFUCK HARDERFASTERmo /v =^..^= Mew! /v and please don't forget the grown cats! They need love too! /v My kitten has a obsession with trying to climb out of the 3rd floor window! He pushes it open! It's so scary! /v You should also tell people about the juvenile stage /v Lactose free milk is an ok treat, but remember it should be a treat only! it should not be given every day for meals, and DO NOT REPLACE KITTEN FOOD WITH IT!!! If you find an stray and hungry cat(kitten) meats like bologna and tuna can be a good temporary meal, remember that KITTENS need specialized food because they are still growing /v Ok so you guys live somewhere because your all British /v I may can help you some people those who have cats: \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc65cmyl - Ultimate Cat Secrets \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y7c953cv - Brand New! Cat Language Bible (tm) How To Finally Speak Cat!\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/ya8zlknb - Cats Spraying No More\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yayxackq - Cats Spray Stop /v My kitten was weaned young. If you have a kitten like this buy it a bottle (even though it doesn't need it) and every few day give them about a 1\2 tablespoon of milk. This will make the kitten feel more at ease with not being around mum. I did this with my baby boy until he bit through his bottle. It really helped him relax and he quit crying. /v CATS RULE!!! dogs drool... \nWhy should everyone on YouTube suffer for a few dumb things PewDiePie did? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v In Pawtrait, there was a cute pic of the baby Simon's cat on the wall. :) /v I absolutely love kittens.  After the kitten is... 'dispatched' and skinned, remove the head and tail, trim out the larger meat fillets, dip into a mixture of beaten egg and basil, coat lightly with breadcrumbs, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  Serve with mini red potatoes, asparagus with a drizzle of lemon-butter.  The me - yow factor is off the charts! /v I hear everytime that appartment cats have to have another cat as a playmate. Because as i was young we had a cat and he didnt had a playmate. And my cat doesnt have one either. Just me and my family. But a friend says everytime that my cat needs another cat as a playmate. Is that true? /v Adult cats are pretty awesome choices too if you are looking for a cat. No potty training, they still bond to you, they are chill (most of the time). Even when I adopted the really mean older cats, they turned into cuddle bugs after a few days because they are out of a stressful environment. :) /v and this is why you set up the camera first. Simon never learns. /v Oh you quickly learn not to give your cat milk even if he loves it so much and meows so desperately when you have milk in your hands - cleaning the litter box of cat diarrhea is not my favorite. /v Nicky gives so much of wrong information away. No good for anyone who really relies on that information. Many people have already written about the information:\n- no milk (kittens and cats are lactose intolerant)\n- leave the kitten alone when it just arrived and allow it to settle\n- adopt at least two kittens, not only one\nWhat I haven't read yet is about the age. Adopting a kitten when it's only 6 or 8 weeks old, is way too early. Kittens must not be separated from their mother until they're at least 12 weeks old! And please make sure that neither you or a family member has an allergy against cat hair before adopting. /v Flagged and reported this video as hate speech. /v Where are all the black and white cute vids and higinks /v What about don't tickle a cats belly unless it's learning as it's not really something a cat wants nor accepts most of the time. It shows its belly as trust not as a sign for a belly rub. /v You can give a kitten goats milk it doesn't have as much sugar in it to upset the kittens tummy. All your vet. I use it when many cat isn't feeling good. I warm it before feeding it to him. He's 19 yrs old. /v Im going to do cat animion soon but I'm lacking. A cat /v If I had known this was a Nicky video, I would have clicked immediately because I like the way she says port of call... /v Nicky 3 /v 2 me there are 2 things about kittens to know. I love kittens.(adopted a blind on that was weeks from birth. Sadly died falling from a high spot. Sad sad moment.) 2 my landlord is antipets and he is evil....(it makes sense though pets can cause some issues.) /v There are 2 cats in my neighborhood that I feed.  The boy enjoys leftover milk from my morning cereal.  The girl will generally leave it alone- unless the boy is around to drink it. /v I like the way she says Kitten! /v Milk no no cuddles, love,  playtime, and sleep ( with or without human) excuse me, my kitten is halfway up my curtains!!! /v what pisses me off is people dumping kittens on the side of roads when shelters cant keep kittens there always adapted out. its fully grown cats and dogs that they have issues finding new homes for. /v Good points. I like the presentations with Nicky. Lots of good information for cat parents or people thinking about becoming cat parents. /v Good job recommending the shelters and rescue facilities.  They have so many cats both kitten and senior that need good homes! /v I love Simon's Cat videos.  They remind me so much about my own four mystic moggies who, sadly, are no longer with us. /v so are nicky and simon hooked up??    she's a diamond.........and she has an engagement ring on /v Can you do What Things You Need To Know About Adult (or Senior) Cats? /v You should probably say another animal's milk or cow's milk. It's strange and unhealthy for any being to drink the milk of a different species  Not to mention the cruelty involved in obtaining milk from the mother. /v can you do a video on feral cats? /v I prefer 1+-year-old cats over kittens.  Sure, kittens are cute, but older cats are more level and easier to train (*less* distracted).  Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice creamwhen we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.  You could tell that it was a power issue because he NEVER did that with Sue (15), our late Heeler mix. /v That was very informative and very entertaining to watch good job Simon /v I do find some of the narratives helpful and I learn something new everytime I see an episode!! /v She's a cutie. /v Loving this! I am the proud foster mommy of 5 tiny tumbling tigers.  It's so much fun to watch them learn and relate to my 4 adult cats, who have stepped in to help care for them by disciplining them, washing them and of course, playing. Trying to get staged photos of them is exactly like this, the minute one poses beautifully, one of their siblings or an adult cat steps right in. /v Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them. /v My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too. /v The end was Savage as fuk /v i love the cats  /v My cat is highly lactose intolerant lol when she was a baby she used to get sick from her mums milk but she's healthy strong and beautiful /v I just said goodbye to my senior kitty. The last thing I really wanted to do was bring kittens into the house but I was alerted to 16 kittens desperately needing homes. I took 2 home. I  am nursing an injured leg and need to rest it a lot.  The kittens insist that my face is the best place to lay down and sleep. I realize how bored I woul be without these 2 kittens!  Figaro and Octavia. /v Is it true that, for a kitten, playtime is just as important as a good diet? I don't remember where I got this information from. The kittens that I've ever had, when they wanted to play I did my best to provide play time. When they wanted to rest, they were allowed to rest. They grew up to be fine cats. /v I have a kitten named Zeus and each time you cuddle with him he'll start sucking on a blanket or Whatever he can reach, i know this is from him being away from his mother too early, but i was was wondering if there is anything i should do? /v We recently got a beautiful black kitten from a rescue shelter. If anybody wants to see her then there's a video on my channel! /v You can buy Cat milk :))) /v Cats are lactose intolerant, like me. My cat loves yogurt and ice cream, like me. We fart together /v Do yourself a favor and get an older cat from the shelter. Kittens are super cute but older cats are less likely to get adopted so they need you more. Plus they are much calmer and you will know exactly what kind of character they have. If you have ever experienced the havoc a kitten can wreak on your home, you know what I'm talking about. /v my cat sometimes goes on the couch, stick her paws into the cushions, then whips her head around meowing before doing flips and turns. If anybody is wondering she's a tortie calico mix. /v It's a common misconception, that cats need milk. Is it? I always thought everyone knows, that cats WANT and LIKE milk but as all mammals they don't really need it. I was mislead by my brain... O.o /v (Christ answers Judas.

She's so strong and I know when I watch this film I'll cry for her and with her. /v Gaga is so inspiring. Im a victim of bullying and broken family.

Doesn't this mean once when I masterbait it'll be watching me /v Hey you just made very critical comment about face unlock. Image if we have annoying friends who always want to break our lockscreen code, but with iPhone EX , they just simply hold the phone to our face then unlocked instantaneously. Wow big no no for $1,500 F EXpensive gadget.  /v Should have taken advantage of that bezel and stuck a camera into it. So thick on the sides. /v I prefer touch id, mainly because you can unlock your phone when you're reaching for it in your pocket... Usually, the phone would be unlocked before you even look at it. I personally think apple is overdoing things just for the profits /v Wow so an apple version of the s8??? /v The iPhone X has a face recognition so these girls aren't gunna be able to unlock their phone's when they take their makeup off. /v I saw an add before the iPhone commercial..

Well I'll stick to my Samsung S8 Iris Scanner thank you very much. /v boys don,t sleep with yr phone outside of yr pockets or you see your girl turn to hulk with yr phone in their hand. /v IPhone 7 8 IPhone 9 that's why they skipped it /v Remember when samsung got all of this in 2013?? /v I don't like it /v im just gonna stick with My 7+ /v In short: iPhone X, lots of features you weren't looking for, none of the features you wanted to return. Pretty af. Expensive af. /v I dont care, a phone is a phone. /v You know they out of ideas when they bring up snap filters. /v Looks like a bad version of the galaxy s8 /v I'd rather go back to a landline then buy one of these. Just not worth the price. /v Nothing special with this. Looks just like a damn Samsung. Nothing caught my eye with the iphone 8+, and X. Ill be keeping my SE since I enjoy the 4 inch and the design of it. /v Does this phone still have a password thing? So you enter your password like usual? /v People hating on the new iPhone cause they want it but can't afford it cause they're lazy slobs  /v I have all of these with my S8 /v It looks ugly when compared to Samsung. Nothing new and not worth $999 /v Where the iphone 9 at? /v Then you just have the s8 which has face recognition and     mostly the same camera stats and its cheaper. /v Looks like a repackaging of regular old iPhones. /v They bouta clone you with that face I'd /v Welcome to the iPhone x it's an s8 but with Apple software enjoy /v Welcome to capitalism where people will spend 1000 dollars the same exact phone they got last year because of a name /v Super beautiful phone?

Based on the Danish book The Snow Queen.\n\nThis movie being similar to The Book of Life would just be a continuation of the tradition, although this seems to borrow a little too heavily, visual-wise... /v Where are my people who were at the animation panel at D23??? /v Wow Book of Life 2 looks amazing /v They got the *FUCKING MEXICAN CHANCLA JOKE IN THERE IM SOLD.* /v Book of life 2 hmm ok /v Looks similar to the book of life. /v The Book of Life looks a bit different /v Boycott this movie . It's the book of life knock off . /v The next TOP Animation movie all the time.!! /v What's the background song? /v Am I tripping or has this been a movie before??? /v It is lowkey like the book of life not gonna lie  /v I really want this movie to do well, but I have a feeling it might go the same route as The Good Dinosaur or Cars 3 :/ /v Hopefully this movie is a lot better than the trailer. I'm Hispanic but Pixar has not been putting out hits and misses /v This movie will never play in my country illegal movie /v Man, this promises to be a stunning work of visual arts. /v When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!? No! Its when they are forgotten.\n- Dr. Hiriluk from One Piece\n\nThat's what I came to my mind when watching this trailer. :) /v i just want to watch the short i dont have time for this /v We all are still waiting for incredibles 2 and toy story 4... -_- /v It be nice to see a movie about something other than dia de los muertos when doing a movie about Mexican culture /v I got REALLY excited when I saw find your voice. Only to scroll down to see that it's not by Chip Skylark and get immediately disappointed... /v I love this, I can't wait to see it /v Reminds me a bit of Spirited Away /v they literally wrote this after me...  /v Half of the people will be there just for frozen /v I know this is the worst place to put this comment but im 12 and is it weird that instead of masturebating i dry hump pillows are there others or is it just me /v cough Book of life knock off /v Very similar to the book of life /v I thought the dog was named Coco..?? /v That... almost seemed like a Beetlejuice reference. /v Man this is a pretty big meh. /v Man, what an original movie that is totally unique and isn't a carbon copy of a movie whose name rhymes with The Book of Strife. /v I don't know if I should bother seeing this one. After watching 2:09 I'm pretty sure I've already heard the best joke of the movie. /v Kubo and the Two Strings + The Book of Life = Coco /v Book of life and kubo and the 2 strings but not as uniquely animated /v Now the beaners have a movie... Way to go Disney.... Fucking Inclusive /v Kubo and the Book of Life /v I'm not feeling this one.\nSorry Pixar. /v Not really grabbing me. Then again, Pixar always makes crappy trailers to great movies. Still going to watch it. /v Can we just acknowledge the chuncla swinging that happened. A+ for authentic use of a flip flop. /v I have to watch this movie. /v This would probably be a movie that I would actually like from pick star /v This is such a cute movie. /v The book of life on steroids /v Please tell me this isn't disneys attempt to have a political voice in the border control issue in our country. /v Lol bro don't use my culture and play with my sympathy. For profit lol as*hole /v Basicly a remake of the Book Of Life /v I hope this movie does not get deported /v Book of life rip off?\n\nBring on the Disney USA brand racism! /v PUTA MADRE (the only Mexican word I know lol) /v it's, it's just, it's book of life /v Don't let this distract you from the fact we about to shell out 1k for a phone /v Wasn't this already made? /v We won't be seeing this on NETFLIX  /v This is a book of life rip off /v Why do all the Mexican pixar films involve guitars? /v The Book of Life didn't live up to my expectations, the animation style wasn't my favorite and there were some scenes that didn't sit well with me. I hope Coco is different, the animation looks worlds beyond BOF at least, and I like the idea that it follows a young boys adventure in order to follow his dreams without the romance plot. /v The child acting seems pretty bad in this movie... /v Man i want toy story 4 /v A Disney movie with a Mexican protagonist, finally /v We promise its not\n the book of life /v Sooooooooo damn exited for this.....  /v Suscribe te y me sucribo /v Whats with this diversity trend nowadays? /v Kubo was already done /v Tim Burton and Spirited Away vibes  /v Beaner Spirited Away /v lA CHANCLA /v bitter sweet symphony /v Who else got some Beetlejuice vibes at 1:09 ? /v Song /v not very interesting /v ALEBRIJES!!! /v Also known as lame Spirited Away... /v disney be promoting some diversity lately. /v Disney here to exploit another social dynamic... \n\nSigh... /v Book of Life 2.0 /v Tim Burton's Corpse Bride anyone?? /v Filling the Mexican quota? /v hmmm...Book Of Life 2? /v Book of Life + Kubo /v XD  /v Looks dumb /v The trailer looks wonderful /v Something worth watching /v shimmy shimmy cocobop? /v Looks good 'Book of Life 2 ' \n() /v Dis gonna be best movie, guaranteed /v Looks kinda cool /v Y para todos ustedes que *Viva Mxico*  /v I just hate how every movie based in Mexico is about the same things and uses the typical stereotypes smh /v They all got deported /v Please tell me the Grandma doesn't die. /v Very impressive Vedio so nice /v So expensive . /v Aye. /v #9 on trending /v a laur, tern. /v i,m hart aplle /v I have iPhone SE /v 11 minute I phone ad /v 7:58 iPhone ex smh  /v I like= 1 iPhone 9 feeling loved \n\n\n#7ate9 /v Airpower looks like a maxi pad *facepalm* /v ijustine how do you use Siri now /v Ridiculous /v I have an iPhone 5s /v wow i'm still using iPhone 5s /v cool /v  /v Your awesome  /v The iPhone x sucks /v send me new iphone justine /v PASS!!! /v Gotta get this  /v newer phone, still not as good of a screen as s8, s8+, note8. Iphone x doesn't even have as good of a screen as s7 edge. S7 edge has wqhd 2560 x 1440p and 538 PPi density STILL better quality screen than apple. Apple os? Still shitty. No customization everyone has the same looking home screen. It's just trash dude. Only reason iPhones are fast is because of the simple Operating system. And it's still not that much faster. Just now catching up with wireless charging,just now catching up with fast Charging, just now getting an OLED, doesn't even have a headphone jack and they couldn't make it ip68 water resistant? Pathetic. Worth $1000? Absolutely not. Forced to use face id? Trash.they force you to use their ecosystem, stupid. Still no external storage? Ridiculous.  Simple phone for simple people. Just my opinion but I don't get how people can pay that much for a you can't use to its full potential /v Im going to buy the iPhone X but first Im going to save money /v Dont drop the x .. or shall we run a pool for how long it will take for you to drop the x .....  /v Remember when she was with toby Turner /v Honestly that part about the aluminum replica of Apple Park amazed me. What a day we live in. Incredible technology on display. /v I have an iphone 6 right now, and ofc am going for the iphone x. I havebeen waitng so long for this and i can't wait. I'm also really wanting the nes apple watc. I have the first version and it's just not good anymore compeard to that. I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO START SHIPPING /v Nice camera hump, what is this 2014? /v I want the 8plus and I have a 6splus right now /v Im only on an iPhone 5s  I cant wait till the x is released /v I really like the new iPhone but I think I an gonna wait because I love iPhone six\nBUT the face id is a worry because what if a teenager gets an out break of acne and forgot there password and if they are wearing a full face of makeup and they look way different without makeup\n\n(just saying) /v I have the iPhone 7 plus but I'm going on have to wait until next year for to get an upgrade. I'm leaning towards the iPhone X. I saw the presentation in the Apple Store yesterday online /v I am getting the 8+!!!!!!! /v Am I the only person who thinks that sort of looks like a Samsung? /v i'm getting the iPhone x as a gift from my brother ! /v The price come on now that's crazy /v umm iphone X or 3 months  of rent ? /v Planning to get the iPhone se /v Can't afford one /v Not worth the upgrade from iPhone 7 plus /v It's called the iPhone X , check the apple website /v An iPhone isn't an iPhone without the home button.......WHY DID THEY REMOVE IT???? /v iphone 10 is coming up..... its time to buy an iphone 6 /v OMG I NEED TO BUY THIS! /v Wait so the air power won't be able to charge a series 2 or lower watch? Smh......  tf Apple. /v Could an identical twin trick the machine? I suppose the answer is yes, said Mike Shultz, founder and CEO of Cybernance, an Austin-based cyber risk management firm. http://time.com/4940176/apple-iphone-x-face-id-facial-recognition/ /v What if you have a twin?? /v I was so crazy about apple  i phones but i think im good with my 7 plus .. /v i just got the product red iphone lol /v I am sorry but Iphone X is more beautiful than you Justine.\ntoo bad I cant afford it. /v I love how they say only $999 nigga just say 1k!!!! /v Subscribe to my channel TRAP BEAST iPhone X Giveaway on hitting 500 SUBSCRIBERS /v I hate the new iPhone X  /v My only question is  if you can raise to wake your screen or tap the screen for it to turn on, what do you do to turn the screen off without the sleep and wake button! /v Actually I wasn't Listening i was just watching you!!!!!!!!! I Fall for You Girl /v The iPhone x looks just like the essential phone /v Will the smaller iPhone 8 have the portrait mode?? /v Can I use a password instead of face ID? /v Oooh been holding out on the Apple Watch. Finally with cellular support...Great reason to upgrade to Apple Watch series 3!!! /v It's like a damn galaxy or android. It's nothing new. I'm pissed. I'll stick to my 6+ . These new ones keep getting trash and more trash . /v Says perfect marriage like ten times /v Its not edge to edge. Not even close. /v i want an iphone SE 2 though /v Welcome to 2009 Apple. Your still behind in the tech world. /v You would buy anything that Apple releases. /v It is X, but it is also 10 Justine. It's what some call a Roman numeral /v I have an iPhone 6s Plus. This is my first iPhone from being an android user. Had the phone for about over a year. This phone has actually lasted a bit longer (as far as malfunctions or any serious damage) than I was expecting. Glad to see people get excited about something and yes the price tag sounds expensive but if you think about these phones are pretty much miniaturized computers that allow us to do business and personal things. Some people have started their careers on YouTube or other media. And also you look familiar like you been on tv? /v The new design and colors are the only things I'm interested /v I'm happy people are excited, but I will keep my compact, inexpensive, headphone-compatible iPhone SE, thank you very much. ;) /v The iPhone X is a rip off. It doesn't offer IP68 water resistance like the Note 8, or Galaxy S8, or heck even the Galaxy S7 for that matter. It doesn't have a headphone jack and instead requires an easy to lose dongle and gives you yet more stuff to carry around that a $1,000 phone should not require. Yeah that dongle screams premium. /)_<\n\nThe iPhone X does not support fast charging out of the box and requires you to buy two more adapters to carry around in addition to your headphone dongle just to get it to work and yet even more money spent. \n\nThe iPhone X now supports wireless charging! Yea! But unlike the Galaxy S8/Note 8 does not support fast wireless charging. \n\niPhone X starts out at $999.99 before tax and offers no MicroSD card slot for expansion, instead forcing you to spend $150.00 more for 256GB, which is still less memory than what you would get had the 64GB iPhone X just supported MicroSD cards. You could have popped in a 256GB card and had 320GB of storage for that same $150 upgrade. And it would be removable! Just pop it into your desktop for simple copy and paste file transfer to a hard drive and your done. But nope, you need to wire up to your PC and use the cluttered iTunes program, or the incredibly slow data munching cloud service to transfer files. \n\nSo who wants to take bets that the new improved camera on the iPhone X will still record all audio in mono sound when shooting a video, instead of Stereo like every other phone. (In 2017 the iPhone 7 still records in mono.) \n\nAnd so much for that OLED screen. I said that Samsung doesn't sell their best AMOLED screens to competitors, as the Galaxy gets the best of the best. I was right.  \n\nThe Note 8 has a Super AMOLED display that produces over 1,200 nits of brightness and has a 2,960 x 1,440P, 6.3 inch display, with a pixel density of 522. The Galaxy Note8 is certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium. And it has full 100% DCI-P3 Color Gamut. \n\nThe iPhone X has a 5.8 inch display (5.15 usable) with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,135 (Apple calls this a Super Retina display.)\nThe display has a nit brightness of 625. (It won't be as viewable on sunny days in comparison to the Note 8 which is 2X brighter.) \n\nThe iPhone X screen has a pixel density of 458 PPI. \n\nThe iPhone X uses very cumbersome and likely not truly reliable face unlock tech for mobile payments and access to your phone. It also has support for traditional pass words which would be the wiser of the two main options. \n\nThe Galaxy S8/Note 8 also have face unlock, in addition to Retina unlocking and passwords. Plus they have very reliable fingerprint scanners unlike the iPhone X for access to the phone and for mobile payments.   \n\nAnd finally the Note 8 and the iPhone X both support Augmented Reality tech. However only the Galaxy S8/Note 8 support proper VR.\n\nSo is the iPhone X worth a $1,000.00??? Not in my opinion. Especially since the iPhone X isn't a $1,000.00 when purchased. You have to figure this  $999.99 + say Wisconsin sales tax of 5.1% for example if you just happen to live in that state. Now the phone costs $1,050.99 + those spiffy adapters that you need to purchase for your fast charging, which brings you up to another $75.00 or so. Plus now add $200.00 for Apple Care+ and finally you may need a case, so there 's another $35.00 ~ $75.00 for you. So realistically your spending about $1,400 for the phone. \n\nSo should you buy the iPhone X? That's up to you. It's your money. To each their own. \nShow less\nREPLY /v The real question and I hope you make a video of is Face ID vs Touch ID. A lot of people such as myself feel like they should've made Touch ID an option and implemented either on the back or power button (which is no longer the name of it.) how can people like myself look pass Touch ID and learn to adapt to Face ID. I like being able to go to the bank or shopping to use Apple Pay and not worrying bout looking at my iPhone and swiping up to active Apple Pay. /v I don't know, I am honestly still deeply thinking about whether I should get the iPhone 8 plus or the iPhone X. I mean I like how the 8 plus has a big screen which I'm used to but at the same time I love the design and concept of the X. /v Thoroughly unimpressed as I type this from my S8 plus. I wanted to be excited for the new iPhone too. The fact that they are asking $1k+ for it when you can pick up an S8 for under $600 now is also laughable. Sorry to say but Samsung has had the smartphone game on lock the past 2 years and it doesn't look like that's about to change anytime soon. /v I'm going to wait next years iphone, and next year iphone x will be cheaper.... /v Why isn't the iPhone 8 named iPhone VIII when the iPhone X is called iPhone 10 if that's the case.  Was OSX called OS 10?  Apple makes good products, but they take the naming and terminology used for marketing of their products too far. /v I have iPhone 7+ and 6s and 5 and  iPad Air 2 and i will buy the iPhone x I mean 10 love you baby /v It is the iphone X. Not the 10. Its the 10th anniversary edition. Which is why they went with the X. /v Omg a new phone when half of kids a week ago or somethingim just joking I know it wasn't last week got the all new iPhone 7+. That is how mac makes millions, and kids are in streets, lol /v I have that same necklaces !!! /v This Girl said worth it  /v They didn't address identical twins... /v Remove headphone jack \nRemove home button \nRemove charger port\nRemove screen /v Will I be able to preorder the iPhone X? /v apple propaganda ijustine - this is far more secure than touch id 6:00 , FACE ID MORE SAFE really? i think not !!! what if i'm sleeping and someone grabs my phone and puts it on my face?? you are reading a fkn script from apple . /v I dont like the new gold color it looks girly /v Now people don't have to torture people until they get their passcode just show the dead persons face /v I don't even have a phone /v Those f***ing android users whose comment meh meh meh android is better than apple meh meh meh android did it first WHATEVER! They only say that because they are to poor to afford an iPhone or they just want nude ads or viruses on their phones, if you hate apple, then just dont watch these videos, go back to your explosive phones and stop making jokes about headphone jacks.\n\nCmon bring the hate cuz I dont care  /v I thought the iPhone 8 had a glowing Apple logo at 3:03... /v I have an iPhone se and I'm not switching cause I like the small phone! /v Honey, I want to buy this 2k skirt!\n\nNo!\n\nOh, come on ! Take a look at it !\n\n\nFine!\n\n\nBing, ur order was place -Apple Pay /v I'm hopefully getting the iPhone X in April cause that's when my contract end and I currently have an SE /v So... how are we going to screenshot /v Well they can be /v Gonna buy the iphone x and 8 for sure /v All the haters out there can suck it and shove up your note 8 up your ***. This is going to be the next big thing. /v When I roll over in the bed at wee hours of the night to check the phone I have to wake up the phone, put it to my face, then swipe up on the screen? Seriously? I understand being biased, but DAMN! /v I find it funny how no one is asking about the force touch... Does the iPhone X have force touch?... /v And no one cares what happened to the Nine, for some reason. Apple jumped the gun here. /v It's okay Pewds, you still my nigga <3 /v Everyone is a little bit racist. /v But you are making an excuse.?\n\nThere is no heat of the moment in gaming. Your sitting in a fucking chair for hours. This so called enheated moment isn't an excuse for racism. Lol. Fuck this guy. Shut him . /v Honestly everyone who got mad is a snowflake /v F@#k the Wall Street Journal. /v No one would of battered an eye-lid if Felix had dark skin pigments but because he doesn't it's offensive, having one rule for one race and another rule for another is racist. The word should not be publicised by rappers or anyone, it's the reason why people don't think twice when the word comes to mouth. 95% of the time when people say the word it isn't to cause offence, so can we ban the word all together or make it not an offensive word. /v Felix control your crazy fans instead of having them childish tear down a beautiful game like Firewatch /v You are part of the problem. /v This clip was just on the news here:\n\nJust a one and a half minute video, you can really tell he does'nt mean a thing, he does this time to time /v Felix is such a sound guy he the type of guy to borrow a COD game and give it back no scratches 100% condition /v Out of all the horrible shit going on in this world, y'all gotta hop on Pewds for saying a single word that most of y'all have said at least once in your life time /v Hi pewpeipie: You make a lot of money on youtube. Your apology was awful. There are several instances where you failed to acknowledge the severity of you behavior. If you cannot, on your own, address your public presence and your own actions, you need to employ someone who can. The next time you fuck up, find someone with more sincerity than you to write your copy. I will do it, for money. I am more sincere and apologetic when I don't do the dishes. It is not hard to express real shame and ownership of your actions. If you need help, I can help you. For money. /v I personally forgive you I have been there before but with only one person who knew for you to take ownership for something like this in front of almost 7mill ppl is amazing and keep up the good work :) /v Words are neutral, it's the intent that matters.  People get more offended over words than they do actions these days. If this is what causes the world to standstill for a day then people are going to be in for a rough time in the coming decades. /v Damn it sucks when you're white /v Come on pewds we all make mistakes, you are a good guy , see ya bro ;) /v Thanks Pewds for Making this video. We keep support on you bro! Brofist  #BroArmy /v lost 2 mill in 5 days every done before. /v Whoever killed bootypie and made him say bigger must die /v He's human guys .... let it go /v Why is the n word held to such a high stander  no, no one should be saying the n word and being black does not give you the right to say it and quit acting like all whites are racist, it's more racist marching around calling whites racist cracks that need to be burned /v I'm behind you 100% pewdie. I'll admit I didn't like you very much back when you were just a let's play channel, but since you've opened up more, I find myself clicking on all of your videos. What drew me to you is your decision to just be yourself, rather than trying to be what you thought everyone wanted. I know it gets tricky when it comes to the n-word, but I personally prefer the uncensored pewdiepie. Don't let it get you down, you do you man. /v Apology & acknowledgement of accountability aside, you have to face the music buddy. The racist accusations prior to this blunder is why it is being blown out of proportion as per how your loyal subs are putting it. I don't think ppl are butt hurt at the fact that you used the word. I believe the resentment lies in the fact that you have been rebutting claims of racial bigotry for some time now & your use of the word, more importantly, the context in which it was used, has legitimized said allegations & has discredited your defense in the entire situation. A person who feels lied to will look at you sideways. Good luck Pewdie. /v We live in a world where 'literally' can literally mean the opposite of literally. Words means nothing, it's all about the intent. He was angry at a person and chose the worst word he could think of on a whim. It wasn't meant in a racist way, obviously, so people making this about race are just being stupid. But that's not what some people are freaking out over, most of this hate is from people who want to live off of youtube money, because it's easy and fast money. God forbid they have to get a real job. /v It takes a man to apologize for something that big. It was just an accident and he regrets it. /v Honestly, we all know he didn't mean it in a bad way. It's not like he poked fun at the history linked to it, he just said it as a curse word. like fuck and everything else. Why are people getting butthurt over this? Seriously. People just wanna make drama out of nothing. /v You wouldn't of said it in anger if you dont regularly say it. It rolled of your tongue like nothing. /v people is making a big deal about felix accidentally saying the n word we all make mistakes and try fixing it thats what makes us human /v What is sad, more than anything is the amount of young black suburban kids defending you. So low in self worth they would accept your bs apology. /v 90% of people hating on pewds probably say the n word more than he has. It's all about money and exposure, sparking up any drama to bring in traffic and revenue. Don't let the media get to you, which I know can be hard since you're always a target. Great people have slip ups, doesn't tarnish your amazing legacy and charity work. You raise millions of dollars for charity but news outlets are too worried about a word that mostly white people get offended about. /v Nice one Felix, anyone who watches your videos regularly would know you're not the racist asshole the media perceives you as. Everybody makes mistakes in the heat of the moment, I know I have. It's not like I didn't think you would respond with a formal apology, but I'm glad you did all the same. Watching that live stream, I knew the moment you said it that it had no meaning behind it, not to you. At the end of the day, you can take this as a learning experience and so can every other youtuber x /v Mistakes always happen. Dont judge him because of 'ONE' negative thing he said. Just remember all of the positive things hes done, including charities and making you laugh all the time. /v Hi I don't know what's going on (because stupid internet was out thanks to HURRICANE IRMA ) but ..........UMMMMM KEEP DOING THE BEST WORK YOU CAN DO  (I am so inperational ) /v I have been a fan for a long time and still am, you have helped me through some tough times and i like most of you comedy.\nthis was disappointing:( /v I like how everyone is like ITS THE MEDIAS FAULT when Pewdiepie isnt even blaming the media... he said a word that he probably shouldnt have said and he claimed responsibility and apologized and people are saying that its not a big deal and even though that might be true to you it might not be true to other people and pewdiepie knows how people look up to him and he just wanted to say to his fans he is sorry if anyone was offended, thats it. everyone acting like the world is out to fucking get them... get the fuck over yourselves... (90% of people who dislike this comment are probably hypocritical 10-22 year old people who talk about how media is out to get them and watch Angry Feminist Complications or some bullshit like that... get a fucking life) /v Biggest problem with the word is it wont stop beeing used aslong as it's accepted beeing used by African Americans,   Especially in situations like PewDiePie's,   he Blurted out a Negative Word to release his anger and in those momments you don't really think through what you are / were gonna say you just  react more or less and use something from your vocabulary, and aslong as you keep hearing the N word in movies / tv series and african american youtubers using it and music,  it's gonna be in our minds, and vocabulary and it will keep comming up.\n\nso chose,  either make the word less of a deal,  just ignore the negative sides of it and let it pass into history eventually..\nOR make it just as bad to use for everyone and unaccaptable in any video / movie / Tv series / Music, by any actor / host / famous person,  no matter the background. /v You have racists defending your use of a racial epithet; you don't deserve to have any sponsors. You don't deserve to be a public figure in the gaming industry. This guy is viewed by millions of impressionable children and he is an influence. You are way too irresponsible. /v Roses are red..\nTrees are way bigger....\n\nAll this fuss, over a gamer saying *igger. /v Pewdiepie your such a good person  /v well, at least you're trending again /v It didnt bother me one bit, ive heard worse listening to other gamers.....its 2017 ; #getOVERit /v I didnt see the vid but what happened /v People make mistakes pewds, we love you and i hope people respect your apology and see you as who you are and what you try to be. Always a fan, always behind you! Im glad you owned up to your mistake.  /v LOL! No, no, no. I'm sick of y'all tryna smooth it out for being racist. You said so own it, Felix. Don't throw rocks and then hide yo' hand. You're lucky that this is only an Internet thing. Again, own it. No excuses. *Ownership.* And quit speakin' through yo' nose. Nasally self. I'm done. Witcho lil' ugly ass... /v omfg it's just a word, what da hell happens with world in 2017 /v Personally for PewdiePie to say a word IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT and being accused by so many people out there of him saying it... I think it was being dragged. Yes I know the N word is not a common word to say at all but he could have also said Bi*ch or Bas*ard or anything else that would have targeted others still... \n\nShould not have said it, but hey its not the end of the world either. We should focus on more things in life /v It takes a real man to admit to their mistakes /v did he say the n word? /v Those saying get over it and it's just a word or he slipped up. Nigger is not a word you blurt out 1 time. The history behind that word makes all the worse and those who are saying get over it are not affected by it and for him to say it in that context with that energy tells me he says it in everyday day life off camera. Can't respect that, he showed his true colors /v I have never subscribed to your channel even since you first made me laugh a while back...  I think its finally time... /v Everybody is racist at some point. I forgive you Felix. /v The next keem  \n\nIt's a joke. I got heated in the moment '-' lol no really it's a joke. /v To quote Ian Carter;\nEither everything's okay, or nothing is. /v I was upset and disappointed at what he said, but he apologized and it seems really sincere so I'm going to forgive him and move on. /v Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. Enacted by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures in the late 19th century after the Reconstruction period, these laws continued to be enforced until 1965. They mandated de jure racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America, starting in 1896 with a separate but equal status for African Americans in railroad cars. Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War. This principle was extended to public facilities and transportation, including segregated cars on interstate trains and, later, buses. Facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to those which were then available to European Americans; sometimes they did not exist at all. This body of law institutionalized a number of economic, educational, and social disadvantages. De jure segregation existed mainly in the Southern states, while Northern segregation was generally de factopatterns of housing segregation enforced by private covenants, bank lending practices, and job discrimination, including discriminatory labor union practices. Jim Crow was a pejorative expression meaning Negro.\n\n\n\n\nJim Crow lawssometimes, as in Florida, part of state constitutionsmandated the segregation of public schools, public places, and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants, and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was already segregated. President Woodrow Wilson, a Southerner, initiated segregation of federal workplaces at the request of southern Cabinet members in 1913.\n\n\n\n\nThese Jim Crow laws revived principles of the 1865 and 1866 Black Codes, which had previously restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans. Segregation of public (state-sponsored) schools was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education. In some states it took years to implement this decision. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but years of action and court challenges have been needed to unravel the many means of institutional discrimination. /v I thought it was hilarious /v Sorry just because your ass in under fire... /v Pewdiepie, you are so down to earth and reasonable dude. I can't think of any other famous person that I feel like I could sit down for a drink and speak to like I speak to any friend. I'm sure if someone doesn't recognise you out there you wouldn't feel any weird to talk to and you surely wouldn't ever go out screaming it at their face that your famous. That's just not the image I get from watching your videos. Keep being cool. /v Don't say the N word. Please. /v You seem pretty right wing and unhinged these days...  Dude, just chill and stop watching FOX news for a while.  Sure PC is annoying.  But going all right wing is going to fuck up your life.  Pretty soon you'll be extolling the virtues of the Aryan race, denying climate science, jumping off the deep end.  In 20 years when even the retards accept climate science and the pretty consistent trend towards increasing empathy towards people different than you plays forwards you'll seem like you were on the wrong side of history. /v I still love you dude, don't listen to them. If you weren't the number one subscribed Youtuber, nobody would care if you said the word. /v It was a stupid thing to do, so now it's your job to learn from your mistakes and be the best that you can be.

Its a word nothing else and nothing more. Its a new generation so its time to move on. /v I have never watched narcos or any of the trailers so I have no idea what the actual show is like. But if it was like this I would put it on the watch list /v The actually story is so fucking dark, this is too funny /v I'd watch this movie. Lol /v Someone  in Hollywood should  make  this into  a movie or a tv show /v They should make this a fucken movie! /v If this isn't one of the best thing's that I've ever seen, I don't know what is.

Big Bang/10. /v Bunny: well... it's not cool to have a hand up your butt \n\n /v Please make one for *Westworld* , you have clearly perfected the art . /v With that voice and scenes that were picked he is a totality different person. LMAO /v Pure GENIUS. Funniest thing in ages and NO lips can errors  /v I haven't a clue what the original series is, but if it isn't about somebody pretending to be Pablo and then falling in love with really being him then I don't want to watch it. I'd watch this show for sure though. /v This was a good show.   But I liked how you totally changed it, looked almost real, obviously the voices made it funny.  I'm glad I saw the show before this trailer or id be confused. /v This one is really good. Nice job BLR /v a new level for BLR quality. /v What's the song at the end of the trailer? It's so emotionally powerful that gives me goose bumps every time. /v hey I live in Pensacola /v I'd rather see this then the actual Narcos. /v It's like Dave /v This one is like a touching movie's trailer ;-; or isn't it /v I would actually watch this xD /v Lol.

Hands down. /v I came here to laugh, but I left in my feelings. /v This is simply the best! /v This is their best work. /v FEATURE LENGTH!!!  Must see a FEATURE LENGTH ONE OF THESE!!! /v Why do I want to watch this as a movie! /v This was really fun to watch. Great job /v You guys have earned my like /v *Jelly. I like it.* /v The basic plot of Soy Pablo is very much like Dave (with Kevin Klein and Sigourney Weaver). If Narcos had a similar plot, I would consider watching it. If not, meh. I'm tired of all the dark and depressing shows. /v Please make a full episode of the show just using edits from Narcos! I would watch this show! /v if this was a movie I'll watch it /v That was great guys! /v What a rollercoaster!!   I was so close to dislike and not finish but then it was awesome!! /v If this was real, I would watch it. /v It turn out to be more emotional than funny /v 4:14 That guy sounded extremely close to one of the minor characters from Kung Pow.... /v The baby poking thing had me roaring /v IT 2017 trailer bad lip reading? the movie was exceptional /v I love this.

This is simply amazing because it shows hard-work, talent, and a sincere love for his work /v Dude you need to get into making Full length movies. Like making fun and covering movies like MST3k.

Bravo ! /v Ya feel that pinch? /v My legs broke ahh XDDD /v Call me 'El Guapo'.\n\nLost it. /v Liberals are still easier to troll. /v Haha funny, they interviewed me. After exposing them, they never put me on.. weird. /v If you think these people are dumb, you have never seen a mark dice video making fun of liberals. Next level stupidity. /v I like this guy, he's funny /v Jordan: I already got 8 signatures to impeach Hillary Clinton. Take that!\n\nLady:  . . . \n\nThis is what is wrong with America. /v As a European, I don't understand this kind of humor at all. The extremely well-paid clown goes out and makes fun of hard working Americans, most of whom are poor and uneducated, simply because of their political beliefs? And then he tries to makes it seem like THEY are the ones who are messed up in the head? I mean, not everybody can have daddy pay their way through college and for study abroad trips in Europe like Jordan Klepper had growing up. Some people had to quit high school at 16 and work the family business, scraping by only to have their entire world crumble because their insurance went up 60% from Obamacare. \n\nBut that's okay. Rich little clown boy can just go on making fun of everyday Americans. Enjoy another 4 years of Trump in 2020, morons. Keep mocking the blue collar people and make all your rich socialite friends giggle. The rest of the country will keep on rejecting you. Seriously, what utter rubbish this is. Go make fun of celebrities in Hollywood, or somebody who actually deserves to be mocked, like the Prime Minister of Canada or Trevor Noah. /v Oh Christ not here\n\nBoth sides have no idea what they are doing /v This is a shame . Alex Jones is destroying these cowards. Can't even throw a solid punch back at this point . Boycott comedy centralized /v Voting against your own interests, it's the American way\n*nods head* It's the American way /v Well we where trying to stop you from killing yourselves but foolishly you keep trying. Don't come crying when the devil comes to collect what you've given him. /v No! No! No! Come on!!! If you're gonna support or trash something at least be consistent. /v The media is a business, their job is not to tell you the truth, their job is to tell you what you want to hear so that you keep coming back and watching, like an entertainer, it's how they make money.  This guy is just another entertainer. /v So no one is gonna address the Chuck Ponytail? /v How bout we not just point fingers and whine about how it's the other parties fault and how they are all stupid and blah blah blah, can we just like, idk, go to starbucks and talk through our problems like normal people.\n\nLike think about it logically, if you make an angry accusation, conspiracy, generalization, or insult at one person or group, what's going to happen, well the other side will just get angry to and probably send some angry accusation, conspiracy, etc right back at you, ultimately getting you nowhere and possibly only accomplishing in boosting your own ego,\n\nFWAQ (Frequently whined about questions)\n But im proving him wrong and making him look foolish!!!\nNo your not, your just being a butt and making yourself look like a butt.\n\nBut she's being absolutely ridiculous and ignoring plain facts\nAren't we all ignoring the plain fact that we are being ruled by our reptilian overlords! No but actually if we actually stopped yelling at each other we might be able to start repairing things and maybe by some miracle start figuring what are the actual 'plain facts'\n\nBut everyone knows that WE'RE right!!!1!!!\nThats what the other side says too\n\nBut haven't you seen videos of (Insert generic group) on (insert non sponsered video site here), they are just morons who don't even know politics, all of them!!\nA real answer to this one. After being through more than my share of counseling and therapy I can say this is one of what they call a Cognitive distortions. It's what happens when someone has a bad experience with one person, interaction or thing and associates that bad thing with the entire population. This can cause major problems if lets say someone gets rescued from the sex slave after being abused by a bunch of men, and after that they are deathly afraid of any grown man because they associate grown men with fear. Oh wait you don't struggle with trauma after one bad experience from a person of a political party! WELL THEN WHY ARE YOU MAKING GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT ONE ENTIRE POLITICAL PARTY BASED ON ONE MORONS WORDS OR ACTION /v I went to Harlem Ny. What did i see? Signs claiming Harlems rebirth. With Yoga shops and Starbucks. Tech Industry folks in high place lofts. A Black person here and there. Liberals have promoted this progressive veneer. Diversity inclusiveness. From Portland to Seattle. Declining minority populations. Its a scam. I don't buy the bullshit. I have eyes. /v Trump people are so stupid it's hilarious... they have no idea what's happening to them /v 0:35   Hail Tony, Hail our people and Hail victory !!! /v That black guy is a disgrace to all black people oh dear /v If that's the definition of Great, then I'm good /v I'm pretty sure these people are actors. Still really funny though /v It's sad that you have to straw man an entire group by hiring randoms to say random shit. /v I give you the poorly educated.  They don't even understand that you have to be in office in order to be impeached. /v If we make fun of ourselves enough, maybe we'll start to reform. /v I don't care which side this show or network leans toward but that looks funny as hell /v We laughed at my friend's college roommate for reading Ann Coulter and watching Colbert.. Now we're gonna have people quoting Klepper at white supremacist riots.  /v Thanks for a laugh and some dam good points! /v What state is this so I can never visit there? /v Lmao, nice. A troll trolling trolls. Conservatives love joking with liberals and I love it when it happens. /v It's like the Colbert show! Ah can't wait. /v The salt in this video is palpable. /v Yes, find the stupid ones (there are many on both sides) and present them as the majority. Thats how you make things worse lmao /v Lol I love how the old dude was like I heard a rumour than he immediately changes it to I heard the truth xD /v I wonder how much he made by selling those impeach hillary shirts lmao /v So they just rehashed Colbert's character? /v Comedy Central no longer the central of Comedy. /v So this guy basically stole his entire shtick from Mark Dice, how original. /v I'm all for making America great, Trump is NOT going to do that. /v This better be good. /v Their brains just don't exist. /v Muslims should be banned from public benches, restaurants, the sidewalk, public buses, public parks, Universities, American jobs, owning businesses, having representation in court, having civil rights, or voting. Other than that they're welcome. /v I like the part where no one threatened him. /v Way to be a white man subversively calling a black man an Uncle Tom... stay classy Comedy Central.  White liberal hypocrisy at its best. /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v Ugh. Lame. I see the conservative hosts do the same shit on the other side. Bottom line: smart people are at work, dumb people are at political rallies. /v But who's that black guy though? /v I've got no problem with real Republican voters, but damn this Trump supporters are idiots! /v I don't mind this show /v this is actually funny. fuck the daily show. /v The amount of edge in these comments. /v This is what the Colbert Report would've been like if Stephen just did fieldwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I love it! /v so they guy tries to spin some lies into the truth, or say stuff really fast to try to get someone to look stupid. im sorry im not impressed. youtube gavin mcinness and trump protesters and you will see the difference. just the facts and stupid people. no need for trickery or lying to them. /v Get a job Jordan. /v Lmao what a bunch of stupid asses from Trump supporters /v I keep having this re-occurring nightmare that I'm trapped at one of these fucktard conventions, and I can't get out.  It's truly terrifying. /v Klepper is going to realize how many dumb fucks live in Arizona, I hate living here. /v It's a fake tripod. It only has two legs.. Epic.  /v doesn't matter, just spew it! /v All he did was reinforce what those people were thinking. They think they're even MORE in the right now. /v Is this the left's answer to Dice? /v Impeach is the wrong word. You meant deport. /v Wait I thought only liberals were stupid BWUAHAHAHAAAAA /v Fuck us all /v lol they are so fucking stupid /v Stand strong kekistan Brothers and Sisters, they will never oppress us!

This propaganda isnt serving anyones interests. /v B E G O N E T H O T /v Why do people go to rally's good luck convincing anyone to switch sides. And to think a president on any side is going to fix all your problems is stupid. Focus on yourself and the people around you that's what matters. /v At least they have a sense of humor. And are not hiding their faces, committing acts of violence or burning anything down. Quite refreshing. /v If you have children under 16...

The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called theWifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth. /v Jennifer Lawrence is a fucking idiot. /v Boring noise pollution at the end of the video. I expected lawerence to do better. Maybe in archery she would win over jimmy. I personally would be good at knife throwing and archery and some darts. No real experience in ax throwing. I would try it someday. /v Thank you Jennifer for all your nude pictures that leaked. #fappening /v I recognize that hat somewhere. Is that pharrell? /v Woh, Jimmy threw at the crotch and the head???  John Wick's pencil and Jimmy Fallon's ax, who wins? /v That's a hatchet. /v Legend say the table that she pushed still rolling now /v I like how jimmy had to actually check to make sure he didn't decapitate someone /v Oh is this the same girl that claimed the recent hurricanes are a result of Mother Nature being furious with Donald Trump? /v What a sick game. /v You should have stuck with music jimmy at least then you wouldn't have been working in an entertainment goulog. /v she a damn nut job saying the trump the reason where having hurricanes stupid bitch /v Haha great thing Ive seen Jennifer Lawrence naked af , if you know what I mean..............anybody on Pornhub? /v It's kind of telling how concerned Jimmy was about the genital hit being un-digestible for his audience. Spineless. /v What's the use for goggles? Like what they protect from. /v she has the cutest giggle/laugh /v Came here just to drop my dislike on this liberal cunts video. /v Maybe she should stick to archery... /v Jennifer Lawrence hasn't had her ass kicked that bad since she lived with her step-father!  /v How many points for the Crouch /v You just ruined my image of Katniss. /v Wow I love your upside-down cross earings, I love clogging and I'm totally into Satan. /v I didn't even know you were Jewish! /v why r dey only wearing safety glasses !! if dey lost their eyes by accident they can atleast feel their surroundings.. bt if dey loss their hand or other parts of their body den dey can see bt won't b able 2 feel n can do nothing abt it.. \nit'll b like being a  millionaire in ur dream!!\nso u should wear full protective gear if u r 2 wear one cuz ur eyes r not d only organ dat r precious 2 u!! /v It's pretty obvious now why Johanna Mason was the axe thrower in the Hunger Games instead of Katniss! /v Totally robbing Johnny Carson these losers couldn't hold a candle to Carson. /v Got a better use for that axe <Snowflake Hunting season> /v Never done axe throwing, but I doubt the googles will be helpful if you get hit by an axe bounce back /v Jen's like a mother! to me and that outfit qween!! /v Jimmy was an Mohican in his previous life. Lol /v I didn't even know Jimmy was jewish /v The fact that jimmy threw it in the same spot as Johnny Carson... /v She should prob just stick to the bow and arrow. /v Jimmy needs to get H3H3 on here /v Male evolution at its finest, this is the product of thousands of years of hunting and war passed on to generation after generation. Even the weakest of our gender, like Jimmy, can throw a weapon and his target. I don't want to say woman are useless at this kinda thing, but 95% of them are. I mean she's throwing with two hands and he's using one. C'mon girls you can't compete with us at this shit. /v This would would have been awesome to see Jason Momoa do lol /v Damn, JLaw's so hot when she throws an axe. That's a powerful woman! /v OMFG! Watch the last time they were using that target on the tonight show, in 1965-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L5QC9ZJkM8 Jimmy Fallon hit almost exactly the same spot as Johnny Carson's guest did more than 50 years ago! /v _Got a little wood there_ is funny, but not as good as Carson's ad-lib... /v Too bad they didn't throw the axes at either of their heads. /v after what that retard said about the hurricane your going to let her throw axes? lol /v She the one who blamed hurricane irma and Harvey on Trump. Typical moron /v This very thing happened on the tonight show with Johnny Carson back in the 60s. He hit the exact same spot too. /v surprised it wasn't Trump on that target. Just saying, these liberals are crazy. /v That doesnt sound like a good idea...Should the drunk really be throwing axes? /v Is this how she won the hunger games? /v Who the fuck taught her how to throw an axe? Because that was all kinds of wrong. You can tell Jimmy was nervous for real the way she whipped that thing back, can you imagine it slipping from her fingers and flying into the crowd? /v Writers must be out of material. They're recycling old Johnny Carson stuff now? This was done with Ed Ames back in the 60's, and his hatchet hit EXACTLY where Jimmy hit. They must be trying to get back some of their demographic that grew up watching Johnny Carson as kids, but won't watch now because the show has gone so flagrantly political in the past year.  Didn't work. Still won't watch the show anymore. I didn't vote for Trump, but Johnny Carson would NEVER have been so political on his show. Way to screw up a good thing, Jimmy. /v None of you will believe but I'd destroy both of them at this I once tomahawked a tomahawk 3 times in a row /v I didn't even know Jimmy was Jewish! /v I keep picturing Katniss Everdeen and the blue haired guy.. /v When this video started I knew someone was gonna hit him in the balls. /v You've just tuned into celebs doing dumb shit and getting paid for it! /v I liked it better when Johnny Carson and Jay Silverheels did it on the tonight show  back when Johnny  did The Tonight Show can't he do anything original on his show now /v I love how Jimmy copied a bit from the early black and white Tonight show with Johnny Carson /s /v I didn't know Jimmy was Jewish? /v This reminds me of a clip of the old tonight show where they did this and Johnny Carson said to the guy throwing I didn't know you where Jewish /v This has happened before...\nhttps://youtu.be/0L5QC9ZJkM8 /v 1:15 I didn't know Jimmy was Jewish. /v Who says history does repeat itself? /v Wait what happened to his co-host? /v If Jimmy join Hunger Games, he would've killed Katniss :P LOL /v Katniss Everdeen didn't make its appearance.. /v Smh Katniss /v Hatchet not an axe /v I just saw hur anus online. HOOOT!!! /v You gotta love Jennifer Lawrence!!!!!!! /v 1:12 Crotchshot! /v Shes fucking hot but shes an idiot. /v Fucking Muslims. /v Katniss sucks. Wasnt even close. /v Watch this awesome guys rocket league shot /v JENNIFER SMASH! /v @EvilSpock u do to /v Geez Jimmy hit both Heads. /v https://youtu.be/rkq5nbi-3js /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L5QC9ZJkM8 /v Boys rule. Nice. /v Freaking LIBTARDS!!! /v SHE HAS NO BOOOOBS ...HOW UGLY /v Hereeeee comessss Lawrenceeee!!!! /v Wrong head! /v Hey Paul! /v Jenn is awesome, bye haters /v Fiiirrrsssttt ttthhhooo /v Low blow Jimmy, low blow man /v I wonder if trumps to blame for these bad axe throws too? /v This again shows that men are better than women in all physical things. /v Why the hell was she holding them that way?  You're throwing an axe, not trying to kill a lion with an umbrella /v I liked her ending to the face contest better....I'm sorry, I'm a bad person /v F*** stupid ass celebrities can they do Humanity a favor and go off and die /v *The Hurricane wuz due to Trump. Idiot !!!* /v Jennifer tries too damn hard to be quirky. Her voice is the worst /v Jennifer Lawrence is uneducated and retarded. Literally. /v I wanted someone to say to Jimmy, I didn't even know you were Jewish!! /v She'll probably blame Donald Trump for this too. /v No one likes that hoe .. so annoying. /v Jimmy got the dick and the head...\n\nDick... head... Dick head! HAH! Holy fuck I'm funny. /v That was funny. /v Jennifer = try hard /v Fark Me! Education is definitely not a substitute for intelligence... /v Stop being brain wash you people..... they're telling you when to laugh! /v Carson is so weird; God help Texas, Florida, all of the U.S. /v Since when has ghost face been the head member of the clan? /v Back in 2014 I met Ben Carson in person. After hearing him talk I am convinced on site, that he, is NOT, built for politics. Most of the time he doesn't really know what he's saying or what he's supposed to say. /v Ok I'm no Ben Carson fan but he seriously needs to start making ASMR videos the dude has the *VOICE* /v Go watch 'good good,with god' everyone NOW! /v Ben Carson would make a great doorstop or maybe a bookend. Wait! I got it. He would be a great paperweight. /v im Sending 10mil to harvey & 5 to irma right after we have dinner & 2Mil to kenny , so he can get some weed & 1mil to billy & $1000 to gamestop for some cool games /v Putting a brain surgeon as head of Urban Development is like trying to make Rocket Surgery a legitimate career. /v One fox news clip followed by half a dozen CNN clips, could you really not find anything better /v Their just playing with peoples lives, this is all ridiculous /v Another brain dead troll Ben Carson...Not one person trump has appointed is qualified for any position he has given them. Except the Marine Generals. They are the only professionals in the White House...trump has appointed the rest to destroy the government. A very sick administration. /v Dr. Ben Carson is doing a great job at HUD. He has been reducing  government wasteful spending of our tax dollars, making what $ is spent, more effectively done. He is a well-accomplished man who works tirelessly to help other who are in a terrible way get a leg up. Show him the respect he deserves. /v So many libtards making fun of a black guy. Reminds me every day that the Democrats founded the KKK. /v Liberal Political humor from NBC.. wow what a stretch.  I guess COMCAST will fire you if you say anything nice about President Trump. /v High-key all these casters are starting to get the Trump orange glow around them. /v lol, so many misplaced ppl in this administration. /v Is he just like on drugs all the time? /v I see democunts are still bitching about the fact that Trump is still their president lol /v I challenge  all of you, dare you to access this link and see what the truth is: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Pence+is+a+Pedophile and this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LakXx6A72g   This whistle blower is now dead, another hero destroyed:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl3Q2vKiOzE  The is shyt it real, it could happened to you or I and it is a bi-partisan evil, Evidence pence is a pedophile and possible child murderer and flint knows it and has a list. pence latest: a striver for an academy award,  apparently...  > : (   pure evil /v Meyers needs testosterone or something...conversations with girlfriend should be interesting. /v Is it sad that I Can't even watch the stupidity of many of these news clips when Trump or his people speak. It's too embarrassing. /v I just laughed my Butt off when his Azz got stuck in that elevator /v This guy is not funny. /v Set-up to fail! Blame it on the black dude!

Thank you! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q54gIP6LK4 /v Ben Carson is on sedatives of some sort.Drug addict!! /v Oh! My luggage. My new way to get out of talking to people. /v I think Ben Carson knows a little bit more about the housing projects then Elizabeth Warren does /v Ben Carson is starting to sound more like this dude on a podcast that does a parody of him on every episode. /v Ben Carson is an embarrassment to the Seventh Day Adventist Church and to all Americans. /v Carson needs to resign and go back to saving the lives of children. WTF is a gifted surgeon doing messing around in this car crash of an administration? What was he thinking?\nI cannot believe this is what he wants to be doing with his life! /v I would watch a tv series starring Ben Carson /v This video is a tribute to the lives lost September 11, 2001 and all the brave men and women who died of illness years after participating in the rescue and recovery effort.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zz11ZTB9Mdg\n\n#Don't forget 9/11 /v how is this idiot a brain surgeon? /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v Rza's been the leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, for, like, 10,047 years. /v He probably forgot his brain in one of his patient during a brain surgery! /v Ok this is funny and all but he's clearly on opiates /v SM is a POS /v Ben Carson it seems only became a brain surgeon for the wrong reasons. So he can brag about it on the campaign trail. /v Thanks for showing your viewers how racist Elizabeth Warren is. /v I know a Trumpster who was so proud to tell me he was going to vote for Ben Carson for president until Carson didn't seem to have a chance. Of course, he's white. They don't realize how racist it is to like Ben Carson. /v I like Seth Meyers' comments, but this administration is so incompetent as to beggar the mind. /v I'm thinking that Mrs. Carson is leeching all of his energy. /v How hard is it it's not brain surgery. /v I fell asleep the instant he began speaking. Glue sniffers make more sense /v Can someone set up an investigation into whether Ben Carson is the only human being to spend all his life asleep. /v Brain surgeon? That must be a glorified name for a butcher of human brains. /v If sleepy benny ever slips into a coma, it's going to be a week before anyone notices. /v New kids first day at school ...pretty excited /v Make humor of his policy or his politics, but it's kind of low & a bit rude to mock his demeanor or his nervousness at speaking. /v This man is on Drugs  /v Like HUD? Should have voted Democrat! Like disaster relief? Should have voted Democrat! /v Ghostface is the leader of the wu tang?  Huh?  Let's hear what rza has to say about that. /v Result including meaningful chronic commercial word program profile. /v Even white people know how a good rap be like.. /v Who. ARE. These. People? /v ben carson iis the first neurosurgeon to successfully lobotomize himself /v Ben Carson is a tool, opps sorry I meant to say fool. /v There is not a person on earth less qualified for the job than Bumbling Ben. /v I think it's such a great story that some one with Down syndrome could become a Nero...wait he dosnt have Down syndrome? /v Hey, Seth! In the future, would you mind not referring to people with disabilities as the disabled? It reduces us to our (sometimes perceived) impairments rather than acknowledging us as whole people. Thank you! -An American with a disability /v I lost all respect for Carson the minute he began to shlep behind Drumph and do his bidding. /v Why do all trump appointees end up looking like ghouls? 2:50 /v I really hope he's FULLY RETIRED as a doctor. How did he stay awake during 6 hour surgeries?! /v Carson could get stuck waiting for a elevator. /v Oh no he looks unwell, he has lost a lot of weight, hope he is ok...regardless...Anu /v Call him sleepy and slow all you want, but he was the head neurosurgeon at John Hopkins and successfully separated Siamese twins at the head. Make fun all you want, he is one of the most intelligent men in America. /v He's  Under Developed HUD /v Its not really an inspiring backstory when your one parent works several jobs to make ends meet, when that's literally most of America, not all, but most. Ben Carson makes me laugh, just put the man somewhere we can interact with him please, we need comedy with all this doomsday talk. /v If you think Ben Carson is underqualified try living in South Africa. Our president's greatest qualification is having no formal education. (The reason he can't exactly pronounce a number.) /v Seth Meyers =  /v My luggage!  /v https://youtu.be/o2aqcM2oczA /v Ooooh nooo myyy lugggaaagggeee /v anyone played nier:automata? /v Glassy eyes may explain his stupor? /v I love Ben Carson /v More obsession.

Ben is right.  People and local governments are in charge not the fed.  The us government is broke and they need to cut back a bunch of social programs.  Believe it or not ppl, but there was a prosperous time that existed in america before all these bankrupting social programs existed.  People are resilient and creative when they dont expect the federal government to hold their hands every step of the way. /v i FoRgOt mY LuGgAgE /v Libtard Cuck. #MAGA /v 99 cents stores - all Chinese made.\n$999 phones - all Chinese made. /v now I'm confused.  is it iphone 10 or iphone X? whatever, it sucks:::: /v Welcome to the future isheeps now you can charge your iphone wirelessly ... Wow isn't this amazing... /v Iphone x is a big disappontment that camera and speaker give me anciety its in the way /v I CAN'T GET OVER THAT NOTCH AT THE TOP!!! Please Apple get rid of the  notch next year... and bring back touch ID as a safety net... but we can't have it all... I understand... but I feel it's not truly bezel less with the notch at the top... /v Phones are getting boring. We need the next big thing. The price is crazy /v When the camera is switched on it looks like a shitty iPhone 5 display because the screen is compromised on both sides (top and bottom). If you're making an immersive display then ensure that it's like that in the camera atleast! /v Will there be an unlocked version of iPhone X? /v When Apple said  just look at that photo , just AMAZING. Hahaha thanks Samsung for the screen. FOR F**K SAKE how many amazing adjectives do they need to use, to try and convince you to buy . Oh God and big bezels, ahhhhh sick of Johny Ive... /v I am very happy with my flip phone. I am on a pre-paid system per month. /v Lucky I'm watching this on my phone so i can't skip the ads  /v Fast charge isn't even available, you have to spend $84 for the cable and charger. /v What about the Major Face ID unlock FAIL ??? /v Alright guys look at lg v30 before you preorder your iPhone x /v Apple has become shit now where I use to see comments on the I phone 7 50/50 were for and against it I like it but this X/10 whatever the fuck it is has not got any good views from people it's awful apple for 1K why the fuck would you pick that over a Samsung?? /v A grand for a phone that dose much much less than my galaxy s7 edge no thanks Apple =garbage /v I'm keeping my 7+ for now /v so stupid why you call it iPhone 10 but put title X wtf been apple doing get your shit right omgod /v Wtf the design is ugly as hell /v This yr will be marked as the  yr the underdogs rose - Samsung Galaxy S8/Note 8 and Konami's PES 2018 /v dont you dare call it the iphone x\n\na couple minutes later\n\nto go home on the iphone x /v Glad apple went with wireless charging. Ive been doing it for over 3 years it's very handy. /v Looks like a Samsung galaxy s6, but ugly  /v Its like windows they made windows 8 and then they made windows 10 the x probably stands for 10 like in the roman numerals /v Yeah the X is great but for 1470$ (local price), I rather go for a trip around the world... Or buy a decent used car. /v The hideous black notch at top annoys me I'll skip it. /v Damn Marques shoots his videos on RED Camera... the real MVP.. ! /v Im sorry but that black bezel at the top of the iphone 10 would really annoying the shit outta me when watching a movie in full screen ! /v I'll just stick with my iPhone 6s til it doesn't work anymore. Then buy it again or get android /v I like how everyone is shitting on apple, saying its dead and the company is miles behind someone like samsung. I also like how apple recently passed the 800 billion dollar mark, and by mid next year, will reach a trillion dollars. I dunno, it must be doing something right... /v you have to pay an extra eighty four dollars to fast charge the new iPhone x. lol. the cable and fast charger don't come in the box. a guy has just done a video on tube about it. he's not happy.. fast charging is an accessory. way to go apple. over one thousand pounds then eighty four to charge it quickly. idiots will pay it too. /v Does anyone actually use the Apple ecosystem these days?  Let's see....what is that ecosystem...  Umm, ok.  Open iTunes.  Wait 15 min for it to download a 45 mg iTunes update.  Suppress rage at the shit-unintuitive interface for the umpteenth time.  Oh wait, I get to wait a half hour while it synchs???  Well....isn't that SPECIAL.  Die a little while you wait for the fucking podcast to synch when it fucking never can fucking download when you need it most.  Little circle fucking busy fucking download symbol for a fucking eternity while you never know what's fucking going on.  NEVER fucking download shit when you fucking have WIFI and you could SAVE MY FUCKING TIME BY DOWNLOADING A COUPLE OF FUCKING THINGS I'M OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU FUCKING IDIOTS.  OH NO.  Waste my fucking life.  Honestly wish for fucking death so the fucking pain would stop.  Sounds like something I should really give up $1,000 for, doesn't it.  Wow, what a great amazing experience you give me you child molesting fucking piece of shit company.  GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!!  NO!!!!!   GO FUCK YOURSELF AGAIN!!!!!

The new iPad had its port upgraded to usb 3.1 speeds, hoping the iPhone X does as well. Would really love to be able to import raw files using the lighting to sd card reader attachment and not have it take a million years on the iPhone X! /v They've  copied most stuff from s8 why not copy the nav bar as well instead of those stupid gestures? /v 1000$ just blows my mind for a phone /v I lost interest in iPhone after steve passed away - after I switched to the galaxy note 4.\nI like the note 8 better than iPhone x. even lg v30 is better than iPhone x. /v Worst design ever!!! They would have just copied S8 for once /v Does the Home swipe give a haptic/Taptic feedback??????????????? /v tbh faceID is difficult to use in regular life .\nno fingerprint scanner not making any scene /v after watching this samsung 7 or 8 rules what a fucked up  phone i  give 1 dollar for 1 /v still loving my oneplus3T, no lag until now.. really love it /v When there is an iPhone X involved, I don't think it is a smart move to get iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. There isn't much difference between the previous models in comparison with the new two models, but iPhone X is definitely the next level. If in the mind of buying a new one, I guess it is definitely worth it to pay a little extra to get the complete different one instead of buying a similar one. /v And how are they going to handle notifications if that status bar has no space whatsoever. /v Does it really worth a 1000 dollars..????? /v If your twins u could get in the i phone x easily /v Uk being charged 25% more because Apple can. Not like Microsoft, Sony, Lg, Tesla, Nintendo still use exchange rate /v How do you unlock it in bed with the lights off? /v anyone else feel like the sides, top and bottom of the phone like the corners, look thicker? like a fake plastic vibe? is it plastic and not aluminum? am i the only one who feels like this? it looks thicker on the sides like where the volume button is and ugh it bugs tf out of me /v Looks like a damn samsung. Also they skipped iphone 9 like windows /v The iPhone 10 isn't called iPhone 10 because it's the 10th iPhone, it's called iPhone 10 because it's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. I know its weird, but it makes sense. Also, iPhone X sounds better than iPhone 10. Just sayin'... /v Wait a minute. How do u turn the phone off? /v how would u screenshot on the phone ??????? /v This shows how stupid apple fans are /v What is your theme song in the beginning /v I think iphone X is overpriced....\nWhat do u think? /v Swipe this way swipe that way swipe that sht off the table...bye /v does the iPhone X have 3D touch? maybe a jailbreak developer would be able to make a tweak simulating a home button press near the bottom of the screen? /v OK but how do you screenshot? /v Why didn't they just move the fingerprint reader to the back?\nCould've put it under the Apple logo /v Samsung is better and cheaper.. your literally JUST PAYING FOR THE NAME.. it suck dude!  Rip off. /v Wonder when they are going to remove the phone...? /v I don't know about you, but for me that notch in the LCD is very disturbing and ugly. And also that Face ID seems to having problems at the moment. I think old classic fingerprint is much effective than FID. /v Most Noticed Vdeo in 2017 of marques.\n\n\n\n\n-2017 /v PROBABLY iPHONE 13 OR 14 WILL TURN INTO ANDROID /v it's funny how he says there's two new iphones and then lists three /v iPhones are so simple, there's only one button, (Well not anymore). You just have to remember the difference between a press, double press, triple press, long press, or double tap. Until now, so without the button we have swipe down from the top, swipe up, swipe down from the right, swipe down from the middle, and swipe halfway up. (We still don't know what you do for Siri mind you, probably another swipe). Yeah I'll stick with having 3 clear buttons at the bottom of my screen thank you very much /v If holding down the power button opens Siri, how the duck do we turn off that phone completely /v iPhone X (I won't say TEN). It is so normal. What is the new?! \n'-' /v Yuck!

Or am I thinking of another channel? /v Lord, bless me to get be on my communication disorder and complete my education for Your honor and glory with more accuracy and professionalism than I have in my life now. /v It's gotta be illuminati /v Exactly how I feel about 'The Glass Castle' by Jeanette Walls /v Guy, Reads To Kill a Mockingbird 6 times. Hates himself, decides to justify why the book sucks instead. /v Never read it in school. Tried to afterwards. After three chapters, returned it to the library. /v You ignored Boo Radley. That's why. /v To be honest all i got out of this vid was a newfound appreciation for paperback books. /v I disagree. To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book in my 20s. I didn't read in high school and picked up the book while wondering an airport bookstore. Much to my surprise the imagery created in the book got me hooked to reading. I try to read everyday and I'd like to think TKAM had a lot to do with it. Kind of like if you try something for the first time and you like it, you're more likely to do it again. Great story, holds over time. I'll have to read it again to see if the meaning has changed for me. /v Maybe you shouldn't have moved so many times. /v the book is NOT overrated. /v I hated this book. It is overrated. /v What a cheap stunt by Vox to take an american masterpiece like Mockingbird and call it overrated. My guess is all the people agreeing with the sentiment probably haven't read it since school. Read it again. It is more topical than ever in this climate of seemingly well meaning people falling prey to racism. /v Now I know why Taylor swift's new single is number 1. /v Never read it but I never thought it would even be good. /v I never understood the popularity of this book. I never found it engaging at all. /v My teacher said that this book was one of the best books she's ever read, and it always makes her emotional. So i was kinda excited to read it, but it ended seeming like a very pointless story in my opinion. Very boring and dull, but thats just my opinion. /v I didn't like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGHT ME. /v the book is so popular that i'm pretty sure there is two copies of it in my family house and no one in that house reads, on top of that it was the one school assignment i missed but seen the movie for :D /v ...600% better than [the books you read zero times]? What's 600% of 0? Smh.. If you read the books proportionately to how good they are then TKAM would have been infinitely better than the others (even at 1 read). Prob should have mixed in an algebra book /v So it's so famous bc of paperbacks???! /v The movie is quite good. Gregory Peck playing Atticus worked really well, it would be hard to think of a more contemporary actor being suited to that role. /v Why did they ban this book though /v This is interesting explains how it got popular but it doesn't discredit the story at all?? Like\nOf course ppl liked it it's a gr8 book and the fact that it became so accessible spread it quickly but if it was overrated we wouldn't still be studying it today. Also it's not the books fault u moved so much smh /v Everyone else read it once. Why you moving 6 times. /v TLDW: the book is over rated because they sold a lot of copies. /v i had to read it in highschool, but as a girl in the rural north present I didn't actually understand the words said, but i understood translated pieces from other times and cultures just fine, but that was like, harder to read than spanish for me /v 1961 was the height of the Civil Rights Movement... It was popular because it was so relatable... /v They're too late to restrict hardcover book sales. Electronic publishing has already basically killed traditional printing for cheap high volume books. /v Do the Mona Lisa /v A lot of books on the school curriculum are overrated and should be replaced. /v next is wonder woman /v That moment when youve never read it and thought it was about killing mocking birds\n\n\n\n\n\nBookbait /v I know it's meant as a joke, but there's no way you could logically come up with 600%. /v False equivalency.  No one school system made you read it 6 times. /v I couldn't disagree more. This is trending? Yikes /v Yeah, i never *had* to read it for school, but I read it for fun in 5th grade, but I had to read a bunch of other books that perhaps don't have as much social importance/literary quality. So for me, is the book 1000%+ underrated? I'm just saying the logic in the beginning of this video doesn't really make sense. /v I only read it because I had the chance. /v And it was certainly not a new theme. A better story was Daniel White, For the Greater Good, by Harlan Ellison. A black kid rapes a white girl, has no remorse, and the black civil rights leaders give him over to a lynch mob to become a martyr for the Greater good of their cause. /v Vox being a sucky news outlet presenting what it claims is the ultimate truth on a widly respected book. /v You look similar to macklemore /v Overrated should do a video on White Paintings!\n\nahem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aGRHOpMRUg /v How do I alt key a swastika? /v Next up in the Overrated series, Christopher Nolan? /v Tim Johnson is the real reason /v IF you told me that, I'd be so triggered that I'd have to watch a few seconds of this video to leave a reply. /v Eh... perhaps Penguim books contributed to part of it's success, but the argument simply doesn't hold water by itself.\nThere are some key factors in To Kill a Mocking Bird that several literary staples and cases of explosive success and endurance also usually have:\n\nA somewhat subversive style for the time. As in, uncommon type of literature that took some by surprise.\nAlso subversive ideas. Exploration of taboo and controversial themes.\nUsually a fresh take on a theme.\nPortrait of a given era that people might not be quite familiar with - microcosm exploration.\nCloseness to the authors' own raw, potential scandalous stories, sometimes drawing controversies after publication, sometimes not so much.\nSimple writting, easy to follow, easy to understand.\nA somewhat realistic style, often coming with a bit of grittiness to it.\nNot following a mainstream or conventional structure - monomyth, clear moral lessons, etc.\n(optional) Realistic and raw coming of age story, reality crash, or a complete change of perspective and opinion. Critical reasoning put to test.\nThe common people in extraordinary circunstances thing.\nAll of those might be realized right after publication, up to years after the author has already died... matter of perception of the time it exploded in popularity.\n\nA whole bunch of literary classics follow some of these, when not all of these. Kerouac's On the Road, Sallinger's Catcher in the Rye, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Palahniuk's Fight Club, Capote's In Cold Blood... to name a few.\n\nSee that I'm not criticising the works for following a certain structure nor trying to diminish the works because they have common characteristics... rather, I love them all and think they deserve the success. /v Back in the day they really liked to emphasize women's nipples, didn't they? /v Thought this book was gonna be about Go Set a Watchman and how that book was the original draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. GSAW takes the story of TKAM and flips it on its head, and it is so very underrated compared to TKAM. /v fantastic. so ready for more. /v If you're going to cover an overrated mid-century American paperback ubiquitous in public schools, cover _The Catcher in the Rye_ .\nI mean, it was good, but geez. /v To be honest I think The Secret Life of Bees was a much better book that touched all the same values. This book just made me cry. Not that TSLOB didn't, but...I found it more relatable and I feel like I really learned something from it. /v TBH, I'd rather to kill a mockingbird rather than read bless me ultima again for English class /v I actually never read how to kill a mocking bird... /v So... why'd it become popular? /v If you are not hypnotized by the awesome graphics, skip to the reason, somewhere around 3:22. /v I think it's because teachers are lazy and fail to update their curriculums and lesson plans. There are countless worksheets and assignments from my high school dated from the 80s and 90s /v I only clicked because im reading yo kill a mockingbird r8 now. /v I hate it so much /v Hey a good video that isn't propaganda, good job vox /v Because they forced you to read it in High School and do book reports on it. I personally liked The Hobbit better. /v I don't get this book. It's not good. Nothing happens. You can literally skip entire chapters and miss nothing. Am i missing something here? Why do people like it? Like not from a business point of view but a critic point of view. /v American school's favorite liberal white guilt indoctrination tool. /v Do The Beatles next. If there is any cultural flotsam as egregiously overrated as them I'd be surprised. /v I like how penguin books had a few years where they just were not loving there logo. Sure they changed it often in general, but 1938 was just: nope, nope, eh... well keep it for four years. And 1948 was just: Good lord! look at that lower body!, and there, that'll do for the rest of the year. /v It's a pity you spent 50% of the video's duration simply restating the question /v I'll ship your vanities to you . order InFurniture Inc @ HOUZZ,\n916 as your middle name I'll ask for your discount but I doubt it pal. /v I'm 17 and never heard of this book, am I the only one?? /v Did you forget to finish this video?  The reason the book is overrated was never explained? /v It's popular because it's good. That's about it really. No hidden thing goin' on. /v It's overrated and anvilicious like woah.  But some anvils need to be dropped, and To Kill A Mockingbird still drops that particular anvil pretty damned well. /v guess im not the only one that thought it was overrated. /v If your looking for a interesting and (I guess) grounded explanation for how books such as To Kill a Mockingbird become a sensation I recommend the The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell. /v Never read this in school. Found it at my grandparents house when I was 9. This IS my favorite book. It's well written and takes you to that time and that place like no other story I've read. Sorry, in my mind your just slightly over rated. Like love, it's all in the eyes of the beholder. /v no... the catcher in the rye is the worst book thought in school /v This video explains how it was lucky to get popular, but that doesn't make it overrated /v Vox is just trying to discredit the book. They just don't like the author because of the racism undertones in her books. /v All I heard was Reddit /v do the dark Knight and toy Story 3 /v I had to read it for summer reading over the summer, and now Im Jem in my schools fall play :) /v I read this my 9th grade year you read it in 4th grade... my teacher said it had one of the best endings ever but I didn't understand one bit on how it was one of the best Nobel endings /v bcz school forces us to read it so every1 knows it /v The book was so damn boring /v I Love This Book  /v Catcher in the Rye and how it influenced Mark David Chapman. /v Hate me all you want, but I hated being taught Romeo & Juliet. All throughout the 4 years of highschool English, we had to analyize Romeo & Juliet in some way or another.\n\nDude its an okay story, but its not something that should be shoved down our throats. Seriously, I never learned any English from it other than antiquated words that can not be integrated into modern vocabulary. Waste of time. /v There are many interesting videos on youtube america. /v I Vox was supposed to be PC. Isn't calling a book about black people's struggles overrated kind of the opposite? /v 1984 /v Who has read hatchet? /v People still read? Whaaaaaaaaat. /v Next, how democracy is overrated? /v i hate vox /v http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/100-novels-everyone-should-read/ /v Shouldve shmooped it bud thats ur problem. /v Bullshit /v fav was great gatsby /v Boo Radley kills Bob Ewell.....Oh wait...... /v Never really liked it. /v Hey phil, whats your home town im curious? /v Why is this trending /v I'm a democrat, but I can't do ESPN anymore because their political agenda. And as much as I don't like Trump I don't think he's a white supremacist. Just a dickhead. Also YouTube stop manually putting controversial videos on trending. /v If somebody called Obama a Marxist cocksucker, he or she would have been canned within 3 seconds. ESPN is just more liberal horseshit. And Jemele is a pile of dogshit. /v Why are we talking about the JV team on espn lol /v Another black woman in the unemployment line...sigh /v Influential?....I never heard of the bitch until her stupid tweets. /v Jemele Hill is an influential African American figure? Haha not even close. /v Why the hell is this trending, it has 8000 fucking views /v How the hell did they ever pick Sean Spicer over her? She's clearly the calmer and more charismatic of the two. /v ESPN should fire that lady. /v In 2017 people OVERVALUE their own stupid OPINIONS WAY Too much. Get over yourselves. I know humans have a reality where they're the center in their movie but we go to school for this. The world is DOOMED because of ignorant people. /v Poor Sarah, having to deal with that goon squad every day! /v What seems to be the problem, snowflake? /v What.........???????\nYouTube trending isn't slandering president trump today with faggots like John Oliver. /v Sen. Scott?? She threw out a politicians name, not one real Black person from anywhere in America, just a fuckin lawmaker. /v Why does it matter what an ESPN caster says about politics? That's like caring what a truck driver thinks about NASA... /v Yet there was an uproar when hank williams said some shit that wasn't as bad an ever lost jobs over it. /v She is one annoying ugly chick /v Sarah is fat and ugly. /v O, the sow wants more slop, hear her oink. /v America... say crazy shit and get your name mentioned during a white house briefing than negotiate a higher salary at a liberal network. /v Hell fucking yeah! shut the fucktard mainstream media down! when will they learn their wack shit hasnt a place in the world? /v Why is half her face numb? Stroke? /v Jemille Hill is an idiot & should be fired. Media has brainwashed black people to keep them on the democrat plantation where they are kept in perpetual victimhood, poor & dependent on govt. sick! /v But what about the need to uphold muh free speech /v Why is this an issue or outrageous? We ask know for a fact trump is a racist and a misogynist.  So what's the deal? /v THIS Whitehouse wants people fired for saying something they deem outrageous?? WOW talk about hypocrisy! /v Huckaboo is really hard to look at!! /v Fire Stephen A. Smith that race baiter too. He's 10x worse. /v I use to watch espn for sports, discovery channel for nature shows, hgtv fore home shows, spike for car shows and movies...why the fuck are politics in everything! I'm waiting to see the anti Trump monkeys fight the pro Trump gorillas on animal planet next..wtf /v ESPN fired a guy because his name was Robert Lee..... But they won't fire this race baiting racist who makes a fool of their company any time she is on the air? /v Rich white people speaking on behalf of marginalized communities.\nI'll bet at night the White House looks like the end of The Society; just a white blob of mutual flagellation. /v I can't decide which is more distracting: her long ass unibrow or her dumb as hell lazy eye... /v She looks like that one ugly chick in your crew when your hanging out. You know, the one you keep sending to the bar for more drinks all night. /v Damn YouTube, you've even got Democrats calling bullshit on your trending page. Get a grip. /v If Sarah doesn't lose 10 pounds by the next press conference she should be fired /v She is a much better speaker and much more professional than the last two. /v And that is how you sidestep a question... Multiple questions actually. /v Dude is a white supremacist. He's quick to call muslims terrorists, but won't say the same about his racist white buddies. /v Trump isn't racist, he's just ignorant. Get it straigh you libs! /v I just wanna know why she didn't think it was outrageous when trump said they were fine people /v what's up with her eyebrows /v Fat bitch... I can't stand this lazy eyed cunt /v Well if he didn't want to be associated with white supremacy I'm sure he would have done a better job at dissociating himself.. which he barely did /v I think the Colin Kaepernick affair has sparked people to speak out. /v THIS IS TRENDING AND I AM TRIGGERED!\n\nThe Republican Party should SEIZE YouTube from libtard cucks and turn it into StormFront! /v Hey guys!

NBC Sports and Fox Sports both offer better quality sports programming and don't talk about stupid politics like ESPN does. They'll be dethroned soon by other networks. /v Legend has it that her right eyebrow still remains up to this day /v Regardless of politics Jamele Hill is a race baiter and ruins ESPN /v Everything the left dislikes is white supremacy, racism, sexism. They use it so often that people are now getting numb about it. /v All men do it its called fingering. U dumb cunt /v Oh look.... YT making sure yet another video labeling The President a racist or white supremacist makes it to the trending list so they can do what Liberals do best... brainwash young people with lies and hate for political gain. /v God I fucking hate commie liberal crybaby news press. YOU LOST GET OVER IT. /v Outrageous LOL /v Now that's a masculine looking woman  /v Jamelle hill is a racist nigger. /v America elected a man that confessed to grabbing women by the pussy... on tape. Isn't that more of a fireable offense than calling someone a white supremacist? /v Breaking News: A loudmouth Emotional Black woman called someone racist.   \n\nAnd Idiot report acts like some hack on a pathetic sports talk show on failing ESPN is somehow influential.  /v SJWTUBE /v If I had a pussy I'd let President Trump grab it. He's a good man. Long live the USA, land that I love! /v Every white person is a white supremacist don't you know /v Jemele hill is the perfect example of someone being spoon fed  so much crap by the fake news media, of which she is a member, that you believe it whole heartedly.  She is not as intelligent as she thinks she is. /v Defending trump is like the hardest job in America.... /v Black supremacy is NOT okay! /v Sarah triggers the alt left. /v youtube got bored /v Fuck trump that racist bastard..Fuck all racist! /v Why does this matter? /v Influential lmfao  /v Ugly tranny. /v lol hue is ESPN /v FAKE NEWSSSSS /v Stay in yo lane! Dumb ass jemele /v She likes anal /v Ugly disfigured lying fun, yes I'm talking about this Sarah bitch, fuck this nasty cunt. /v Typical libtard, accuse someone of being a racist without giving evidence of their racism.

Go back to your safe space on breitbart /v Eh, yeah she's probably right here. /v Since no one has asked yet, why is this trending? /v God she's UGLY!!! /v Fuck their asses She has freedom of speech and freedom of press and the things she said were true, so fuck them /v WHO THE HELL RUNS THIS CHANNEL?? ARE YOU A REAL PERSON??? DOUBT IT..     #MAGA /v If I accused Trump for not being born in America, is that a fireable offense? /v Who the hell cares what Sarah Huckabee Sanders has to say about this?

YES. YES. YES. YES. /v I neeed it /v Hi doggy /v WHAT IS THIS!? /v IM SO EXITED /v u r tearing me apart lisa! /v It seems to me like yur a expert Dave! /v Does someone song name? /v What's with all the spam here? /v I finally watched The Room (Not just all the famous clips) I'm so excited for this movie! /v This is simultaneously going to be one of the funniest and most affecting movies of the year. /v Between this and Darkest Hour, I really don't know who deserves the Oscar more: James Franco or Gary Oldman /v Does anyone know the song towards then end of the trailer? /v Talk about full circle = \n\nJames Dean > James Franco played James Dean > Tommy Wiseau worships James Dean > Tommy Wiseau quotes Rebel Without a Cause in The Room > James Franco plays Tommy Wiseau reciting the exact same line from Rebel Without a Cause > INCEPTION /v All the dislikes are from a bunch of chickens /v Is this real ?? XD /v See thing is back then we where all in 2003 when Tommy was in 3003 ahead of his time /v I forgot it was James Franco for  minute /v This legitimately looks like a good movie. I cannot wait to see it. /v This movie sold me. I'm definitely going to watch. /v Hahaha, what are a story Franco. /v why is Chris R hitting the basketball out of Denny's hand in the brick alleyway where chocolate eater gets pushed into trash cans by Mark?\nit's suppose to be that hyperbolic time roof top /v I need to bulk up on some plastic spoons now. /v Honestly... I am. Well, I am kind of skeptical. The Disaster Artist is probably my favourite book of the 2010's thus far, however I find Seth Rogen and James Franco to be lack lister actors with the exception of Freaks & Geeks. Franco's inflections and mannerism (from this admittedly short preview) are at times very Wiseau-like while others seem so far removed from Tommy it is off-putting. However, I am usually skeptical regarding things I am very fond of, so I am still excited despite my concerns.\n\nI will say I am more excited for Best F(r)iends and the possible small part Tommy plays in this movie.  /v this just got .5 million views in 6 hours /v This will be a disaster lol /v Not in a million years! \nBut after that? \nDamn that quote gave me some Disney/Pixar vibes /v Why is he having sex with her belly button? He knows where her vagina is, right? I just can't help but feel that Doug Walker inspired that line. /v Great trailer loved the cast and movie anyway so how's your sex life /v Waiting for December is tearing me APART Lisa!!!! Oh hi Botch /v This film is going to bring Tommy Wiseau full circle.  A man with a vision of being famous and recognized for his craft.  Fails miserably in his own movie.  Movie becomes cult phenomenon.  Cult film inspires real Hollywood film.  Actor portraying Tommy wins oscar for his role in a memorable performance of ineptitude.  Man is therefore recognized for his craft. /v After i watch this i will go eat HAUH /v I'm there, day one /v What not just watch the original /v Tommy might not be a great actor but he's got a great spirit.he seems like a cool guy /v I just now remembered they were brothers /v Theyre making a bad movie about making a bad movie. Lol /v You want a pizza?\n\nI already ordered a tickettt /v Jesus Christ, Franco did the laugh perfectly. /v Franco's impression of Wiseau is actually a lot better than I thought /v I...Cannot...WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!\n\nThe tests came back. I have impatience. /v Jesus loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves. God would love to have a special relationship with you. If you have questions about God I'm here. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your year!:) /v James Franco NAILED Tommy character, I FREAKING WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE /v I think I had a mini heart attack /v Keep your stupid comments in your pockets /v I'm throwing spoons in the theaters I said it ! Lol /v The first trailer for this almost looked like they were making fun of the whole thing and Tommy Wiseau. But this trailer really shows that it's more of a tribute to Tommy Wiseau if anything. James Franco does justice to him in a really funny way. /v James Franco was BORN to play Tommy Wiseau /v Man... I'm speechless, Dave's performance as Tommy Wiseau is really making me feel for the guy.\nThat scene in the trailer where they are in the movie theater and everybody is laughing at his movie like it's a comedy even though its supposed to be a serious drama, hits you right in the feels. /v This movie has already been made. It was called Ed Wood. /v I can already tell that this is gonna be better than Citizen Kane, The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption combined. /v Hahaha. I see what this is.  /v cheep cheep cheep I love The Room!  Oh hi Mark! /v Holy shit this looks great. /v DON'T TOUCH ME MUDDERFAHKURRR! /v You are tearing me apart Lisa!!!!! /v hi doggy /v We try not to sexualise Annie /v Clicked the replay button for 50th times and counting. /v Where's the Oscar? Hmmmmm? I want to see it now? /v I aim where I aim just do the f-scene /v i didnt think i would cry watching a trailer for the disaster artist but i did /v You're my favorite  customer /v I can't fucking wait for this  /v Say no more.  Shut up and Take my money ...   /v this looks AWESOME!!! james nailed it!! i can't wait to see it /v This movie's gonna be magic. /v I did not hit her.  I did not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh hi Mark. /v It's actually amazing how I'm rooting for Tommy /v 3 months. You wants 3 fucking months. I don't got 3 fucking months denny. /v This is gonna be hilarious  /v I CAN NOT FUCKING WAIT! I CAN NOT!!!! /v I think I sense an Oscar nomination for James Franco... ;) /v I retract my statement about James playing Tommy. I'm sold! /v Song?? /v someone please tell me the song name. /v Love the concept, but honestly James Franco doesn't do a good Tommy impression at all (Granted TW in real has a fucked voice so you can only get so close, but this guy sounds nothing like him). Also Seth Rogen hasn't been funny since Pineapple Express. It'll still be good, but I guess we still have to just watch The Room to get the full Tommy Wiseau experience haha.\n\nEdit: Spelling /v Nobody respect my vision /v Does anyone know the name of the background music? /v What song? /v Donate and help out by visiting https://handinhand2017.com/ /v I live in Florida and I had to evacuate, over 6 million people evacuated the roads were insane. I slept two days in my car on an area rest because there was no hotels available, and took shelter in a church. Im trying to vlog all of this but I don't have how to upload it now. Im currently on my way back to Florida, I don't know what to expect. I tried to contact neighbors to see what's going on in my region but had no luck reaching them. Im scared of going back to a completely destroyed home. Not to mention that power is still off for millions of people. If you have a chance please pray for Texas and everyone that was affected by Irma. This is truly a very scary and sad situation. /v MTV you need to give that s*** up no one cares anymore you don't even do Music Television anymore yeah I know they drop the thing but that's what the MTV stands for just shut your channel down let the people get do jobs stop trying to be relevant in this day and age the internet killed the television star suck it up /v this seem so fake to me /v The only time you'll ever get to talk to your favorite celebrity on the phone /v I'm just here for George Strait. /v What a joke , too bad the people who need the help won't see a dime.. /v Being a victim of Irma I personally want to say thank you to the people that took charge to help each other. Literally where I live you see neighbors helping neighbors taking others in where they need help. I just thank god that I did not get hit as bad as others .  Thank you guys and I'll continue to keep praying for not only is, Florida, but Houston as well. /v I was looking for Hatsune Miku and I found this :D /v Sure feed on the real human stories y'all fallen angels men as women women as men.

Jesus rocks /v why does the thumbnail look like a masonic gesture /v whoever had this idea is a complete genius. \nsoo many people would pay 25$ just to maybe get the chance to speak to their favourite actor/singer (celebrity) /v Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others dont? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities? /v Very low views because a sermon from the left bashing the Right /v So liberals start the hurricane and then raise money for the destruction they caused... okay  /v This fund raiser would not have happened if The Donald had not out up a mil. this is not an honest fund raiser its a feel good leftie back rub for their own strike at Trump /v they all can do it themselves. they are all rich right there. why are they asking money from us.  if your going to donate, go yourself over or do it  thru  someone u trust#jesus loves#jesus saves /v Was this logo designed by a communist? /v I wonder how much the celebrities will be getting paid for this  ?

She is scum /v This is only #21 on trending? It oughtta be #1!!! /v I live in Florida born and raised and haven't seen any relief money will we the ppl really be helped?? /v At 34:45 it looks like Bieber is taking 3 calls, never talks, then reaches to the left side of the phone to hang up on all 3 callers. I used to do that too when I had a crap customer service job. LOL Not cool. /v  watch by clicking on icon people's are entertaining you really enjoy /v The sad thing is that it takes something like this for us to help each other.

Raising 14 million dollars sound like a joke to me(considering having them all there). And Apple donated 5 mil of it. I know they have a good purpose. I can appreciate that. But that could be much more if these filthy rich people weren't this stingy. I feel bad for the world but today I especially feel bad for those victims. God bless them and protect them. /v We're the actors really talking to people or is that more used as a visual representation of people giving to make other people give? /v I am sorry but I do not have a red or grey hand so I feel your logo is just not reaching me. /v We can do it together and I hope that all this money does good to all the people who need it /v justinnnnnn!!!!! i love you, i hope you get a lot of money to help them /v Was I the only one who watched vic mensa's ig livestream /v i wonder why they don't invite rappers to rap up in that bitch? lol /v We all better get right and repent! /v White black brown live together all over the United States. Liberal racists just don't like white people. Back fired when we voted trump in /v DJ K. With his baby. So cute but funny at the same time lol. /v Hahahaha I don't know which is funnier:\n*The fact that these wealthy celebrities are asking the broke public to donate, the fact that these donations are going to be pocketed or the fact that they're all acting like they're answering calls...* /v The comment section is frustrating... /v I bet they had a really good time and they partied just inflating their egos these celebrity dirtbags /v Nice, but you celebs are idiots! If you each give 1m, so much will be done! I'm never buying a ticket to a concert seeing that these celebs can't truly give back after earning so much from us. Just ridiculous! /v Ah MTV. When we aren't busy ruining the very fabric of your family by corrupting your kids with immoral values and depravity, we like to all hold hands and take one day out of the year to give back ;) /v Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues. /v don't donate to them because most of the money goes to making this video ads etc. /v Those celebrities were all paid to answer the phones on tv.... from donations. And many were seen joking around. The rich don't care. Ever seen a celebrity actually volunteer .... by doing manual labor for more than a few minutes?? /v Damn Stevie wonder never age he looks younger and younger every time I see him he  been in the music business before  Micheal Jackson  was dominating the music business in the 80s and  and he still look younger than most 30 or or 40 year olds /v you want us to donate money to rich people living in exotic locations who are too stupid to get insurance? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !  HELL NO !!! /v I wont donate to anthing Clinton  and Bushes are involved in. They will steal.it and give it to the rich /v This is sad they asking us for money knowing we struggling helping each other as it is now, they rich they need to give some money, we need all we got. /v 17:18 : is that David Copperfield in the back seat ? Couldn't he use some of his magic (dollars) to speed\n things up a lilbit? /v Figures MTV(masonic television)would use the masters handshake for their symbol. /v **CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX. 97% AGREE WITH THAT CONSENSUS** /v As of 9/13/17 @6pm EDT, despite being on more than 12 broadcast and cable TV networks and other media outlets on the web - this telethon hosted by 125 multi-millionaires drew only 16 MILLION viewers and pledges/donations of $44 MILLION.  All totals are not in yet.   http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hand-in-hand-hurricane-telethon-ratings-1202556721/ /v is this a break from the usual race baiting and division from MTV and now they want to pretend they can do a come together benefit? /v NICOLE KIDMAN GIVE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE WE KNOW ANTONY KIDMAN WAS A PEDOPHILE. #PizzagateIsReal  /v Could have been a great thing. Unfortunately some ot these idiots had to prove that their ego is bigger than their heart and start the political attacks.  Shame on those that did and for those who were there for the right reason, I commend you.  I personally donated through the fund set up by the 5 former presidents. /v So stupid, you assholes drink the globl warming coolade. Ever woulder how the ice got there. /v @29:00 for Dave Matthews singing Mercy /v Nice jam. /v Justin was acting weird /v Pongan Subttulos wey /v 19:54  /v Stealing money! /v Justin is the cutest /v ...IN JESUS NAME, I/WE PRAY, AMEN. /v 48:22 who is he?! /v 14:29 too much surgery lool /v JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE  /v Selena Gomez  /v Selena and Ariana?!! /v Why\nD0nt\nYou\nDonate, stars /v really? /v Lus Fonsi  #Brasil /v Jared Leto  /v Tori Kelly  Bitchessssss /v So proud of everyone especially my boy Justin  praying for everyone affected xx /v Quando tu sei italiana e non capisci un cazzo.Ma il solo motivo  BIEBERR /v i don't get why people are complaining about rich celebrities asking the public to donate money.. i mean that doesn't mean that  they aren't planning on donating money themselves, and i think a concert like this is actually a good way to draw some more attention to a problem and to show some compassion for the one''s affected by the hurricane.. i mean this is better than not doing anything and it's definitely not causing any harm to anyone right...so why complain? /v We donated then spoke to Adam Sandler. Took an hour to get through but like they said dont give up. It was so cool. And of course I hope the money goes where it's needed /v Can we just stop the hate and focus on the good instead? who cares if the celebrities are doing it to skip taxes, that doesn't take away the fact that they took money out of their pockets to help those in need. It doesn't matter what they do, people will always say they do it for free promotion or some sht, but maybe they geniunly wanted to help. People lost their houses, their loved ones, the city they grew up in and you're all worried about taxes! get your priorities straight. /v it is so nice to see how everyone joins to help their country no matter who they are.                  the president was not invited xD /v I wish all of you who are complaining have already donated. Y'all just complain. At least these celebrities are doing something. /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v Who came here for Dave Matthews? /v well done to them but can i just say the james bond guy is british so is some of the money going to the british vigin islands? /v Diddy ugly ass worth over 500 million and he's out here asking all you broke people to donate what little you have! /v For god sakes can someone just say something decent. Who cares who's doing what at least they're out there trying to make money for the victims I hope. Enough with a bush and the Trump this is for all the victims and the animals can someone have a heart out there and just pray for everyone to be safe and restoration /v How can India be a part of this..... /v Bless you all /v Justin Bieber  /v Tori  /v daaaaaaamn leo you hot /v How did he do it /v How on earth did you go home that was absolutely incredible  /v This show makes me feel watching the movie Now you see me Omg he is like one of there. /v may I ask what is on Mel's head  /v Like I'm ashamed of America... Picking someone just  because of ''their' back story. I seriously hated seeing Colin and Celine go. Cause they were awesome and we REALLY need a mind reader to win. Cause I don't know about everyone else. But I'm  getting tired of it just being dancer/singers.  I mean that's what the Voice is for.  We need some NEW stuff. Stuff that hasn't won yet. Like we had that first magician winner.. And I mean Colin could have made it if one of those other singers didn't. I mean come on people we don't need '3' singers out of what, 5-6 people?  We need newer stuff. /v The fakest show ever  americans are seriously dumb  /v Every single time he looks like he's put on more makeup /v This was pulled off in the movie focus with will smith but I never thought it could be done in real life, incredible! /v It was obvious he placed a piece of paper when he asked heidi to stand up . Min 3:07 /v I can hire this guy to open my girl's phone /v i can unlock my ex BF /v So sad he was eliminated /v Where's his teeth?? /v aside from the performance, I really like Heidi's blazer! /v He has to win AGT maybe he should make a prediction that he will win it before he wins it and then when he wins he will show the world that he knew this entire time from the moment he first auditioned /v This magician makes me very tired of waiting to get to the trick til the very end. Oh. Look what time is it? Huh, Wow! That took 5.5 minutes to do a trick. hmm. I think Matt Franco could do a trick in 5 sec. and the audience will see showmanship. That's what this guy is missing. Plus. He creeps me out and some of his tricks are not even amusing like the knife scene to stab Simon. It's not an act and this guy is setting a bad example for kids and they should not be playing with knives. /v It's just garbage. I wish Penn and Teller would come in and bust his balls for being so predictable and sloppy /v 70% of the finals are filled with singers bruh /v How did he know he was going to be at that cafe wtf /v This dude should have got through /v Lol I read it when he revealed numbers lmao /v 1:17 he just threw my tweet on the ground /v https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jDJz3crk-7k&feature=youtu.be\n\nGo to 1:59 and you will see a piece of paper that says Ellen, Rome, and cheese that he sticks onto the paper. Agt cut it out on the video but this vid shows that full act, no cuts. /v So sad. This guy was like my My hero. Well not hero but who I wanted to be like when I grew up. Dang it man. He didn't deserve this fate. /v He didn't make it through /v WHY DIDN'T THIS GUY WIN? HE WAS SO AMAZING :( /v 3:07 - he places a sticker over the tweet with ROME ELLEN CHEESE /v NOOOOOO I LOVED HIS ACT D: /v 1:43 Was I the obly one who read that upside down? /v He had a sticker in his hand when chose and placed it on the card /v This men looks exactly like Robert Carlyle in hitler Rise of Evil /v He is outstanding! Can not believe singers are again the majority of the final show. I HOPE Colin gets his own act in Las Vegas or wherever. He is totally deserving. /v I'm sad that he didn't make it /v Y did he get knocked out by a singer. Wow there are millions of great singer and only 1 master mind reader. /v The judges saw that Colin cheated, made him go in the Dunkin Save on purpose, and voted Diavolo instead of him. Smh with AGT /v I'm actually pissed off. They choose a dance crew (down many times before and also just jerk was a lot better than them) and Colin had an act that only 1 person would probably ever have, like the professional regergitator ( I don't know how to spell it) /v He didn't get through.\nF**K YOU AMERICA! /v I finally figured out how America's got talent works. If they golden buzzer you that means you are good, but they won't survive a couple more performances. And if they don't golden buzz you, that means they like the performance and want to see a couple more instead of skipping straight to the finals. /v He deserved it to be in the finals but he didnt come through :( /v This guy is just the kind of person that I liked the most /v I love how everyone's trying to expose this guy but it really doesn't matter lol. /v i feel he had a rigged tweet card, and used some slight of hand to switch them. As of getting her to pick that tweet is easy. /v The part that convinces me is his undercover work when nobody recognizes him--except everyone in the audience. This is the phoniest mentalist routine I have ever seen on television. /v I must say the way of Colin's presentation is not that good. That must be the reason for which he couldn't be finalist. I personally expected much better from him.\nBtw he can watch Lior Suchard videos on youtube :) /v I really don't understand why people like this guy. Nothing about him interests me. /v Nobody will EVER top this. This is enough to win AGT /v His math is wrong though. It wouldn't be 43 quadrillion combinations it'd be more like 1 quadrillion or 900 billion /v 3:06 he distracts her by asking her to stand, and puts the tweet sticker on the paper. Then forces the choice of tweet stopping his finger on the right one, then switches the entire sheet of paper over afterwards to allowed scrutiny /v I'm so sad he got eliminated but I'm happy that this was his last performance. What an Exit /v Heidi looks absolutely amazing. Mel on the other hand... is looks like Guy Diamond farted on her. /v How did he lose? /v That reminds me of now you see me, the part of the bank /v The dog act though /v you all have it wrong.  when mel b hands him the card he takes it with his left hand and places a sticker on the card with his right hand. watch closely 3:00 /v Ha..how...how you doing that? *peter griffin voice* /v He is the best /v HE HAS TO WIN. /v Since he is so good at predicting what will happen, why was he asking for support on Twitter?  He should have known that none of the judges would be on his side.  \nRegardless, he should have been in the finals. /v I always don't like Say Stop things /v He's wearing a Steve ricks tailored Matt smith coat /v I think people needed to stop and think. LOOK AT WHAT THIS GUY CAN DO! I love Kechi I think she's sweet but there are better singers. Colin on the other hand is crazy!!! He definitely should've gotten through. /v Jesus Effing Christ, how can people be so predictable with naming a city? Can't it be Krakow, Sarajevo, Sofia, or Belgrade or something. /v Did he predict that he is KO. /v It works like this \n1. Show off the phrase, numbers, or words without the victim or audience realizing\n2. Have the card with the thing from part 1 close by so it has a higher chance to be picked\n3. Now that it has subliminally been put into their minds they will be even more likely to pick that tweet or whatever it would be.\n4. Realize this is a old trick Redon, but still is amazing because it will not always work /v I swear on everything this nigga is a legend /v Everyone knows there is no such thing as magic, so this was purely meant to astonish and entertain. I'm pretty sure I know how he pulled this off, but more impressive is how he involved not only the audience, but even the judges. And he managed to pull it off where, without the magic of being able to play this over and over on YouTube, everyone was in awe.\nEnjoy it for what it was. /v Too bad a singer with a tragic backstory is gonna win because that's what people vote for these days /v Wtf is happening with Mel's hair /v I don't know if this is cool or creepy.  Either way,  I'm amazingly impressed! /v Can someone tell me why both America and the judges were so stupid? The 5 should've been Mandy, Christian, Merrick, Colin, and Kechi. And if not one of those then Angelica. But nope they voted for a light show act instead and the judges chose a weird dance play thing over Colin. I'm just done. /v when he asked for a city, I would have expected everyone to put England. /v The only thing amazing about this guy is that he would leave the house with that embarrassing of a haircut. /v Is it just me or does Mel B always look perfect /v The guy below me is stupid as hell /v GOOD EVENING AMERICA ARE YOU WELL?\nYEAHHH!!\nGatis Kandis: No they're not a well, they're a PEOPLE! /v NO RIP COLIN IN THE FINALS CRI /v I am so mad that he didn't make it threw! America wanted him more. The votes were high for him during the dunkin save. Divalo was good, but Colin was amazing! /v Dear Colin's,I am so sorry you didn't get through I was really upset when I saw the results. And I think you should have gone on instead of Diavalo.. Magic like yours doesn't come very often. You are a AMAZING person with so many great personalitys. I  You! /v This was amazing! how did he not go through /v So he saw movie FOCUS .\nSo did we. /v his trick seems like what will smith did in the movie focus ! /v Pause at 1:43 read upside down /v OMG /v omg he's a real live horseman.. #nowyouseeme /v Stupid hair /v Fake /v WOWWWWW  /v ;9u8wepygao eliu gewyfg wyfjg ewjgerh gzerkrheghri HE DIDNT MAKE IT!!! WHYYYYYYYY??? /v Colin was robbed.  /v This is insane /v HOW SWAY?!? /v Demonic /v Hey guys Ali-A here /v Colin Clout* /v ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): ): he went home /v Tweets on Sheets.\nRhyme time. /v fantastic /v EVILLLLL /v Holy dickballs /v FAKE FAKE FAKE, when he asked Heidi to say stop, he put the choices on the card that he wanted. Check the video in slow motion and you can see him move his left thumb to put the right tweets on the card.  WATCH IT IN SLOW MOTION, REALLY /v Riverdale has become the biggest and best thing CW has done!! \n\n\nP.s. YES I WATCH ARROW, FLASH, THE ORIGINALS, THE 100, ETC.... I love alllllll of them.... just expressing my love for this show.... /v DID BUGHEAD JUST HAVE A FUCKING RAIN KISS COS BITCH IM /v I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO can't wait!!! I love 'Riverdale' to the core. /v Bughead!! \nCan't wait anymore /v The song used in the promo is Lykke Li - Window Blues. You're welcome! :) /v VARCHIE IN THE SHOWER IM SHOCKED EVEN THOUGH IM A BARCHIE SHIPPER /v WE GOT A FUCKING RAIN KISS SJSKJSKJSD /v None of Y'all seem to have noticed Hiram looking sinister as fuck... fuck all the ships we got Hispanic Tony Montana and a bleeding Joaquin. \nWhy none of you care about my boy Joaquin??? /v Riverdale is one of my favorite shows of all time!! /v OMG VARCHIE SHOWER SCENEE!!! /v I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks that way but I feel that the trailers are getting better and better. Like the first one they showed at Comic Con was a bit meh and veeeeery dramatic. This one, on the other hand, is a lot more interesting and brings more depth to what we could expect out of this season. And the cinematography seems to have changed (maybe because the writers have been saying that this season is going to be darker).\nI hope Hiram's character will be as interesting as the trailer shows, and that the main characters will grow in depth. So far, looks positive! /v If Fred Andrews dies we riot /v Bughead is endgame, bye :) /v THAT FUCKING SHOWER SCENE THOUGH, BABIES I LIVE FOR THAAT /v BUGHEAD RAIN KISS IS EVERYTHING /v EVERYONES TALKING ABOUT BUGHEAD AND VARCHIE BUT MOLLY'S WINK AT THE END OML /v Bet the soundtracks are going to be mind blowing too\nCan't wait!!!  /v I can't wait anymore for season 2 !!!! /v Varchie  /v God all these comments about Varchie or bughead just stop please!

This is amazing. Can't wait. Riverdale and Bughead. Totally obsessed  /v Question tho? Idk if its a plot hole but why is Cheryl's mom Penelope all bandaged up like its not like she was burned by the fire at the end of season 1 since both of them were outside n she was hysterical hitting Cheryl for what she did. /v I didn't want to like this show but I fell hard for it!  My husband and I both lol /v This show is amazing !! Can't wait for the new season !! /v V A R C H I E /v I love this show but I don't have cable!!!!

Also I have a video called God loves all:message. God loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves. God bless you!:) /v What was that song at the very end? /v I have a feeling that whoever shot Archie's dad was paid to do it by Mr Lodge /v I keep thinking the music is a new Melanie Martinez song /v VarchieeeeSo hyped /v If Bughead doesn't get back together I will cry /v Varchie is the best shipper, hot <3 Riverdale <3 /v BUGHEAD & VARCHIE! /v YEAAAHHHHH BOIIIII /v BITCH BUGHEADS RAIN KISS /v Constipated Archie at 0:02 /v BUGHEAD /v BUGHEAD!! /v 0:20 Bughead /v AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

A murder mystery? /v Whyy /v Honestly varchie sucks /v HES BRITISH ??!!??!!?? /v Nicki's a tired act now. Should've got *Amber Rose.* For just the video I mean. Amber behind the wheel of a slick ride should be the expected sort of scantily clad female eye candy in these sexy types of music videos. /v Did she name drop Seth rogan as Seth ro? /v Hello guys I just wanted to say that I do song covers on my channel, in case you're interestedI'm having some issues right now, but I will get back on track soon, hopefullySorry for the self-promotion, when you're a small channel it's pretty hard getting your content out thereThank you from Italy :) <3 /v Go back to the Black Eyed Peas fergie... /v Inspiration from Madonna's Die another day? Fergie = musically irrelevant as always. /v Black latex outfits reminding me a little of the Madonna Human Nature video... /v I love Nicki and Fergie, but this song is so cringe, it makes Vanilla Ice look like James Dean. /v nicki's verse should put in when the song is about to end like 2 verse before so this song is not boring eitherway, well done tho /v I'll be honest, though I love both artists, this song has some weird pacing issues and doesn't seem that radio friendly /v This song makes me feel like Im a somebody /v Is there a song where nicki is not featuring? /v Love it. Fergie gets down like herself. She isn't TRYING TO BE BLACK when she raps. She always had a funky flow. /v Can I get some likes for no reason /v The first few verses sound like Aluna George in you know you like it /v Most clothing Nicki has ever worn on a video  /v FERGIE IS FUCKING BACK YALL I'M SO READY FOR THIS ALBUM /v What a montage of ripped off shit. /v Eww Fergie stay away from the high notes or use autotune lol /v I wish there was a list of what artists wear and where you can buy the clothes. /v I don't like this very much. /v oh come on fergie.. you can do better.... /v I know u fucking lying FERGIE is that bitch dnt u forgot  /v Nicki with a lot of Clothes  Wow /v I dont love Nicki but this is a good collaboration. /v i came here for Nicki Minaj but second girl is also disaster wow. /v I see this song in the background of tv commercials like target/jcpenny /v Probably the most appropriate thing Nikki has everrr worn  /v That little pat she did at 1:51 with that face KILLED me /v GARBAGE!!!!! another mid 2000 artist that flops nasty....Internet wins again ur industry is dying /v does she try to be madonna? /v The look at 1:10 is FIRE /v who's else there just for Nicki /v whos this old bitch ?? she should be retired lmao /v Wait nicki Minaj was actually present at the shoot??? /v uhhhh what's up with songs like look what you made me do swish swish bish and this???  just so quiet?? it's almost just a voice. all it has is a subtle beat. there's no build-up and its just boring imo  /v Honestly no... if it wasn't for nicki this wouldn't even make it in the radio. /v Fuck Justin he would not take a pic with a disabeld person /v can't believe she's 40 years old /v This is actually pretty good /v Some women really get super hot in their 40s.

I know its hard for you porn addicts playing with your balls all day... /v Is it me, or does Boogie look thinner already? I mean look at his hands, they don't look like thick sausages, they look leaner (No offense Boogie) /v It shows already! Great work, Boogie.

Lazy bastrd /v GUNNA BE AWESOME, GUNNA SEE YOUR PP SOON!!!! GRATS MAN /v You look amazing /v Wow boogie went vegan! /v Looking good man /v He got skinny /v 42Kg in 6 weeks? Is that even possible...? /v What rank would you give Carmelo Anthony? /v as chris smoove would say: melo got hit with the cheese XD or i would expect stephen a to say whoever made this list had to be drug tested or so high or something XD and no wonder y i enjoyed watching tnt nba games over espn because of that X( /v i would not take carmelo anthony on any team.. HE IS NOT A TEAM PLAYER! can he score, yes. does he play defense, kinda. but when you pass the ball to melo its a black hole, you're never getting the ball back,he doesn't make ANY team better by being on the starting roster....the bench yes...starting, no /v What do you expect?  These casual fans think one demonsional players are MVP candidates. /v ESPN is high again. /v I agree with ESPN's list and yes, I don't know shit about basketball. /v hes speaking facts but is it only me or he reminds you of lavar ball /v Melo top 20 I'll give him 15 /v Glad Stephen A got onto something that is absolute crud. /v Tell me what the 63 people ahead of Melo can do with THESE Knicks? I'll wait....and don't tell me the obvious we know that Westbrook, LeBron, Harden, etc can do wonders but Eric Gordon? Danny Green? Harrison Barnes? If they are better than Melo what can they do with THESE Knicks? I just wanna know /v First of all wade ain't even in the top 100 mf averaged almost 20 a game n demar 38 headscratcher /v Stephen A. Smith a GOD /v Lol..one is an all star and one averages 7 points per game.....i have no idea who is better someone tell me /v Carmelo is in the top 25 I can say that with confidence. Put some RESPEK on that man name lol /v How the fuck is DeRozan ranked 36th after averaging 27, 5, and 4? This shit is a joke and everyone who made and let this article come through should be immediately fired. /v Kobe my nigga. He said the same about him and look how it turn out /v Caermello is not elite Stephen a has to admit that now that being said carmello ain't no 64th lmao that's blasphemy he's probably 15 or 16 in my mind but that's his fault nobody respects him because we know he don't care about the game he just about money so oh well /v Myles Turner got a better ranking than Carmelo AND Demar DeRozan. LIKE WHAT? /v I know 1 thing the HOF is b.s Reggie Mitch t Mac B . king yao.  the list goes on . if u don't a mvp or a chip rookie year award or any award u should be in the HOF .its disrespectful to Mj bird wilt many other player that give a 100% every nite . \nDon't tell no gold metal that a give way .we all know a all star team playing again the world . BS /v Carmelo has to go play with a true point guard or LeBron James . /v +50 points for using the word Moribund /v how come no one talking about the slight possibility that ESPN does this shit for content? not taking credit but i forget where i read it, but it makes somewhat sense. ESPN comes up with bs list which then creates reactions from the channel itself thus creating content to talk about. rinse and repeat /v Claims to be a prolific scorer but is in the low 20s...  That's good but to say omg he is a prolific scorer?  Gtfo /v Melon is still a top 20 player easy!! /v Carmelo is garbage and has been garbage /v Melo is top 10 wtf are they talking about? Lol  /v Lonzo hasn't played a fucking min. In the regular season of the NBA  that shit is hilarious /v I must say this is the only thing i agree strongly with sas. /v Stephen A gets all ass hurt when people go after his butt buddies but then talk all the shit he wants about Dez and other guys who are far more talented than Carmelo fuckin Anthony.  That Puerto Rican trash is trash /v It's time to give up the ghost. Shave that head. /v This might be the first time where i totally, 100%, without a doubt, absolutely agree with him.  right on SAS /v ESPN has become garbage. This poll accurately represents them.  They just all political and about popularity now. /v definitely top 20. Whoever did the ranking at ESPN is stupid /v Stephen A made the same mistake he blasted them for ranking Kobe lower at the end of his career, which they turned out to be right about.  People like Stephen A continue to think of these guys like they were in their prime. Carmelo has been in a steady decline the past 4 years, having his worst year last year since he came into the league.   While putting Lonzo Ball ahead of him is a joke, there's little argument he is outside the top 50 now. /v Stop making excuses for Carmelo SAS!! Now I get he doesn't play defense, fair enough. But when you carry all the weight on offense you tend to slack off on defense. That's why Carmelo should not be considered a superstar. Somewhere along the lines he fell into the superstar category awhile back. He's great on offense. Maybe that's why? But he is the Jay Cutler of the NBA by SAS standards. All the talent, weapon on offense, but doesn't make anyone better and can't lead a team. Carmelo should be a solid #3 option to depend. A kevin love all star. He shines in Olympic competition because he has other superstars that need to be guarded and competition is weaker. \n\nI don't care about the ranking. Let's talk about the player. /v There are not 20 players i would take  before Melo. /v At least top 20 come on 64? /v ESPN be covering to much politics to give a damn about sports! /v Shut up Stephen A, you're the one who knows nothing about basketball. Your last 6 NBA championship predictions ended with you picking the wrong winner. You are biased. Carmelo is not great, he destroys team chemistry, he fires coaches, and he is a ballhog who can't win. /v The only reason Melo is being rank so low is because he black. /v Lonzo tho?not hating but lonzo is not even the best in his draft class but he's better than melo smh espn /v I was tryna hear what max was gonna say smh /v 64  disrespectful , do y'all  even watch him play ball !? /v Add Lebron James to that list of players who will average +20 PPG for 15 straight seasons. /v Steve you a 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000% Right....... /v This is why y'all are losing ratings...dummies /v Carmelo fucking sucks. He's only relevant because he's tied to LeBron. He has literally had an average career, never led his team to anywhere remotely decent as in early playoff rounds. Fact is he sucks. /v carmelo anthony should be in the low 300's /v Lonzo Ball going be a Bum An the NBA /v Top 40.. the difference between melon and Danny green is the green plays d.. defense is a big part of the game.  Melon has been over rated his whole career.. he is a star but never truly a super Star of the league. /v Fuck espn that's why FOX sports is so better now /v First Wade and Howard arent even in the top 100, then this. Analytics isnt everything. /v ESPN on Crack lol that Young nigga not better than Melo /v Lonzo Ball was ranked ahead of Melo lol /v This is why ESPN is garbage... /v Say what you want about Melo, but he's a prolific scorer who's going to be in the hall of fame.  To put a 19 year old who's never played a game in front of him is ridiculous.  That ESPN Rank lost all credibility. /v That Steven guy is full of belligerent hot air. /v its funny how they fall right into the trap. nobody would give a fuck about this list if they put people in the right order. they put lonzo ahead of melo 1 spot ahead literally just to make these guys talk about it /v If ESPN analyst | experts are going to vote in a pole they need to attach their name and number so we can track their lack of credability. /v #FireStephenA , this guy has nut hugged crapello since day one, I believe they are even buddies. When has crapello played team basketball? When has he put his team in a position to win? He's a ball hog, with no sense of basketball knowledge, he's a greedy egocentric scrub, who has no business in the NBA. He should have been let go years ago. He's the second biggest cancer to their team only behind leflop james, get rid of crapello anthony and let the Knicks move forward. It's pathetic to see this garbage ass overrated crybaby get his huge contracts, when he can't even get past round one of the playoffs. Obviously every team he's played for while losing had one thing in common. Crapello anthony. /v Wow espn needs to back to school just dumb just dump lol /v Melo is at least a top 20 player in the NBA,only 1 of 4 players to average 20 ppg through his entire career (LeBron,Kd,Jordan and Melo) /v The word disrespectful doesn't even cut it. It's not disrespect. It's straight up non-factual. You can disrespect Melo all you want, but saying a rookie who has never played a single NBA game is better than a player who's been the franchise player for two teams? That's straight up idiotic garbage. /v I'd give him a rank of 150. He can't play any d. Basketball has offense AND DEFENSE, not just one on one ball hog offense. /v I hate people saying atleast have Melo in the top 35-40 that stupid shit right there is disrespectful as well, Melo is easily a top 20 player In the NBA. Get the fuck out of here you haters he was averaging 24 7 and 3 and was in playoff coversation before the injuries of Kristaps Porzingis and the lazy defense from the team, And Melo ended up averaging 23 6 and 3 either way, And is one of the clutchest players in the NBA, and of all time. If this list was a all time rank, 64 would be still pretty disrespectful for Melo, let alone a today list /v WOW, THAT RANKING IS GROUNDS FOR DEATH TO WHOMEVER CONSTRUCTED IT. Lonzo ball is not better than Jusuf Nurkic yet alone..... CARMELO!  NURKIC went 28pts/20reb/8ast/6blk last season with the Blazers. And after the Denver trade averaged 15pts/10reb/1.3stl/1.9blk over 20 games with his new team. That stat line hasnt been posted since CHARLES BARKLEY in 1986.  Jusuf is a top-10 center already in the NBA based on what he HAS DONE. HES DONE IT. LONZO HASNT DONE JACK. Rankings beyond wack. /v Let whoever made the list play hoodie melo 1v1 /v ESPN make shit up so Stephen A can talk about it. /v I clicked this video because I thought the guy on the thumbnail was a black nicolas cage. /v Why do I feel like we get this list rank rant every year /v sas killed it /v Born Buckets /v Carmelo Anthony is a fucking ball hog, Stephen a smith a fucking dumbass annoying shithead. /v DANNY GREEN. Are you SERIOUSSS /v phil jackson ranked it /v Danilo Garinari is really good you sleep /v Danilo Gallinari all day : ) /v Facts /v Lonzo >>>>>>>>>> melo/wade /v They always low ballin my boy melo /v word /v Just disrespectful !! Wow #64 .. /v Id say top 25 ESPN trippin /v dont be cutting Max... punks /v Amen Stephen A Smith. /v Click bait rankings /v Damn ESPN...y'all just embarrassed yourselves /v Lmao they got loLonzomzo above Melo  /v Danny Green lol /v Nah ESPN right.

Glad you guys all got together! My favorite feature is defiantly the new cameras and the Face ID /v I'm not sure how to feel about doing a downwards swipe when opening Control Centre.

What u say? /v I think they should have a thin line along the rim like the on button for the home button /v Wait. The wireless charging is available for all iphones? /v That's a sleek ass looking phone. I'm still going to get my note 8 though. /v FACE ID \nIm sleeping \nmy gf takes my phone \npoint to my face \nunlock\n????????????? /v With no home button how do I take a screenshot /v HAS EVERYONE NOTICED THAT APPLE COPIES SAMSUNG? /v Nothing interesting is coming to the iPhone, but I'm still going to get an 8 plus purely because it just works better with my software at work, smh. /v This guy is so handsome  /v Face recognition has been on android for ages. what Samsung pushed with The note 7 s8 and note 8 was iris scan (better than face ID) /v Nice phone but $1000?

What do you think? /v I'm still running on an iPhone 5.... Still all these android mfs come here every time a new iPhone comes...if Apple sucks so bad why are they still making money gtfo of here with all that crap. Its not like Tim cooks gonna listen to all the fucking Android fans...what I'm trynna say FUCK OFF!  /v I don't know If I want it or not might just get a s8 /v Do iphone x and iphone 8 have have audio jack? /v All this people talking about the price! If you can't afford the phone don't buy it simple as that! How about all those droid users criticizing the iPhone X! Go and watch Droid videos! Most of these users have never touched an iPhone but yet criticize Apple! Gosh! /v Face id is what concerns me most.

Stopped. Want to see the phone in action, not you yappin' and flappin'. Definitely not subscribing. /v The best feature is wireless charging because if Apple does it, then it will become a huge necessity for everyone to tow the line (even though The Simpsons did it first). /v When you take a screenshot is the result perfectly rectangular or does it have those funny ears on the top edge with the selfie camera bezel cutout blank displayed in the screenshot? /v Face ID and Wireless charging is very impressive /v Specs on the iPhone 8 Plus are near identical to that of the 7 Plus. Thats with exception to the new processor etc etc. The camera specs are the same yet 7 Plus users see a software block where they cant use the portrait lighting mode on a phone that has the same camera capabilities as the new one.

He asked his wife then asked his 10 year old son and I'm still ok with anything they choose. Why? Because it isn't about what we eat, its about spending time with your friends. Also, a 10 year old won't pick seafood, which is the only time I get picky about where I eat. /v This is a great example of advertisement!

This video isn't everything. /v Finally, something from CollegeHumor ABOUT COLLEGE. /v Just started my channel. \n\nWatch my new video! and subscribe!    \n\nPlease and thanks  /v Excluding Vermont lmao /v how accurate wow /v Quendelton!! /v OMG She is soo hot! /v Wow, some actual COLLEGE humor /v I hate college /v Real life is hard dawm. /v Your trending!!! /v Umas /v This...is so fucking accurate it physically hurts. /v lol, quite relatable /v Actual college humor on college humor? /v Holy crap they're good. /v lmao so accreate /v this is ucla omg ahahhaha /v this was freaking gold /v Bb /v Lmao dead /v Lmao /v nice /v  /v 1970 ugly ass science building lol soooo true. /v What's even the point of college you just spend four more years of your life learning stuff you'll never need /v Normani's body  /v Ally's dancer was fine as hell! /v I understand now Why Camilla she go... /v Damnnnn these ladies will win a Grammy next year /v Ally killed it vocally..sorry to say, only Ally sounds decent in here..and Dinah close behind /v I'm a girl and I would Like to see them dressed once in a while lol they look stunning but their bodies are Too distracting /v lauren a lil too close with her guy there  /v y'all keep going on about them being uncomfortable with dancers as if this wasn't rehearsed prior to the performance and as if they never met these guys before the performance. They literally did all the moves from the video on stage here so whatttttttt are y'all bitching for? They slayed, their dancers slayed, buy Fifth Harmony, keep streaming Down, Angel, He Like That and Deliver. \n\nThanks. /v AHHHH SOOOO GOOD I love this song they slayed /v Y'ALL BETTER DO IT!!!!!!!!!!! /v Fifth harmony freaking killed this performance!! So sexy, lit, & hot !! /v dame all of them is fine I don't have a favorite /v First 5th Harmony performance I've seen. Good start. Good voices in there somewhere. Not entirely in sync dancing. Can't hear what some of them are saying. Solid B- and an A+ for beaucoup anus (a must as a female pop stars nowadays I guess so why not?).\n\nAnd I can't tell if they're tired or are trying really hard to focus. /v 2:26 that guy is so lucky! /v Normani should be a solo artist /v ok wtf is wrong with lauren's dancer i dont know if this is part of the choreography but do yall notice the distance ally's and dinah's dancers keep? look it 3:05 , check the distance am i the only one who notice this? i feel like hes taking advantage of lauren /v They are all so wonderful! But my gay ass could not stop staring at Lauren /v This should've been part of their vma performance instead of down. They killed it. I'm shook to the core. /v WHY ARE THEY ALL SO HOT /v this is what I NEEDED!! FUCKING QUEENS /v Why does the title of the song have to be 'hoodsoeak? We better dan Dat. /v Not a flaccid penis in the room  /v I loose absolute interest in fifth harmony sigh /v Why do they dress so provocatively. /v Lauren. That's it /v Lauren's dancer was doing way too much...it looks like he strokes his crotch at one point 3:12, he touches her crotch, and his hands keep roaming over her body even on the couch at the end while the other dancers keep some distance. Also Lauren looks so uncomfortable at the end. /v Fuck my lauren  she slay it fuck fuck fuck and by the way that guy who touch my lauren shit i swear im gonna kill him  nobody touch my bias!!! Fifth Harmony is LIT /v My bitches ain't play a game anymore. Rip that stage. /v LAUREN'S GUY DANCER IS TOUCHING LAUREN TOO MUCH! THAT'S NO LONGER APPROPRIATE OR JUST CHOREOGRAPHY. /v They are becoming one in their own different ways. I think now they've figured who they are and how that can contribute to the group's uniqueness. They're getting better and better. Honestly at some point they were stagnant and seemed to have lost growth and direction. They aren't the 15 year olds from Miss Moving On anymore. They are now grown women addressing issues women their (our) age face, hate it or love it. I can only wish them the best from here forth  /v My girls are 30 minutes away from me today and I can't see them because I work. I am so salty /v bump)\n\nYou got that good boy attitude and yeah, I kinda like it\nYou got the tats on your arm, got a bad girl excited\nYou put that bass in the beat, won't you beat it up inside it?\nI got that pumps and a bump and you know you wanna try it\n\nPumps and a bump, pumps and a bump\nHe like the girls with the pumps and a bump\nPumps and a bump, pumps and a bump\nI be that girl with the pumps and a bump\n\nHe like that bang, bang, bang\nHe like that bam, bam, bam\nHe like that love, love, love\nIm like that drug, drug, drug\nHe trip when he on it, one taste and he want it\n\nHe like that bang, bang, bang\nHe like that bam, bam, bam\nHe like that love, love, love\nI'm like that drug, drug, drug\nHe trip when he on it, one taste and he want it\n\nHe got that rough neck swaggy, but he know how to hide it\nHe got that dope boy cash, but he get it nine to five-ing\nHe got a thing for them girls that make their money overnight-ing\nI know he bad for my health, but I still wanna try it\n\nPumps and a bump, pumps and a bump\nHe like the girls with the pumps and a bump\nPumps and a bump, pumps and a bump\nI be that girl with the pumps and a bump\n\nHe like that bang, bang, bang\nHe like that bam, bam, bam\nHe like that love, love, love\nI'm like that drug, drug, drug\nHe trip when he on it, one taste and he want it (one taste and he want it)\n\nHe like that bang, bang, bang (he like that bang)\nHe like that bam, bam, bam (he like that bam)\nHe like that love, love, love (he like that love)\nIm like that drug, drug, drug (I'm like that drug)\nHe trip when he on it, one taste and he want it (one taste and)\n\n(Bang) he love that bang\n(Bam) he love that bam, bam, bam\n(Love) he love that thang\n(Drug) he love that hit and run\nHe lose his brain\nHe going to stupid dumb\nHe stupid dumb, all he ever want is some\n\nPumps and a bump, pumps and a bump\nHe like the girls with the pumps and a bump (oh)\nPumps and a bump, pumps and a bump (you know he wants some, wants some)\nI be that girl with the pumps and a bump\n\nHe like that bang, bang, bang\nHe like that bam, bam, bam\nHe like that love, love, love\nI'm like that drug, drug, drug\nHe trip when he on it, one taste and he want it (one taste and he want it)\n\nHe like that bang, bang, bang\nHe like that bam, bam, bam\nHe like that love, love, love\nI'm like that drug, drug, drug\nHe trip when he on it, one taste and he want it\n\n(Pumps and a bump, yeah) /v Where in the hell is MC Hammer? /v real queens  I love this perform  /v Lauren's dancer was way too touchy and it was just uncomfortable to watch. Just look at her face at the end, she even seems uncomfortable! I know he's a dancer and trying to sell the performance. but the other guys did a great job WITHOUT being all handsy. I don't know I just didn't like him in this dance. He could be a great dancer separately, just too touchy. Maybe next time he should just chill a little /v there's only 4 of them. /v Lauren's Dancer was such a scumbag little tool. Have some respect for her like godamm she looked so uncomfortable and it gave me chills to just see her try and play it off as if it was part of the choreography /v Now who said they can't sing well for this song? YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS VIDEO, they are Amazing!!  My Girls /v Is it me or did Lauren look a little pissed at the end ? /v I love 5H the background dancers grabbing their crotch was kinda cheesy lol /v BITCH THIS IS THE PERFORMANCE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THEY DIDNT JUST RECREATE THE VIDEO THE GAVE US A WHOLE PRODUCTION I LOVE THIS NEW 5H ERA SKSKSKSK /v NORMANI DOING THE MOST AS USUAL  /v Can't keep my eyes off of Dinah!! Like daaayuummmm!!! /v LAUREN'S PART GOT ME DEAD ON THE FLOOR MIJA /v Didn't realise World War 3 would come this soon /v YASSSSSSSSSS!! THEY JUST SNATCHED ALL THE EDGES I HAD LEFT!!!!!! /v OH MY GOODNESS. FINALLY. FI-NA-LLY. A non underwhelming performance!!! THIS is what I've been waiting for!!! I LOVE 5H, BUT their live performances are always so underwhelming like something is always  missing. THIS performance is everything!!! /v This was for all you that said they cant dance and sing f*ck it up!!! /v Why I feel like this whole concept similar to Little Mix? One girl one boy dancer? /v Damn how do I get thick like that /v their TV performances are some of my favorite. This one and work from home on ellen are amazing /v Killed it! One of my favorite performances from them to date. /v Don't touch ma baby's >:v /v I'm so glad they redeemed themselves after live w kelly and ryan lmao /v um excuse me my girls did so damn well and yet they get 1k dislikes? I SMELL SOME SABOTAGERS!! /v These girls know how to preform gah damn /v Damn they all thick /v slayyyy /v Loved the performance..perfect! /v SO SEXUALLY EMPOWERING I LOVE THEM /v when did naughties Beyonc join Fifth Harmony? /v This was very goood /v AMAZING /v  /v Damn..thats so sexy! /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRHhxF2HZMs check out my 3d lyric video /v Umm Carpool kareoke where ya at? /v Normani's body is fire omg /v LAURENNNN WTF EVEN  /v AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /v my queens, yaaaassss /v Dinah Jane  /v THEY FUCKING SLAYED I'M SCREAMING /v Dinah mother flipping Jane!!!! /v asdffgfgkbfivn OH MY GOD YESSSSS /v Lauren got thick /v Hay dios mio fifth harmony legends  /v Essas meninas s arrasam. /v Firts song i like since camila left /v BEST PERFORMANCE EVER /v Lauren is thick AF /v Queens /v Amm Dinah\nAmm Normani\nAmm Ally\nAmm Lauren /v Ew that dancer groping Lauren was super inappropriate and definitely crossed the line. She seemed so uncomfortable, it's insane. I don't like how there's comments like Omg so funny Lauren's dancer def liked her or Omg Lauren's guy was yummy! Imo it wasn't cute or funny, it honestly made me uncomfortable how unprofessional he was being by running his hands ALL over her w/o her consent. She genuinely seemed upset by the middle, and think she should definitely report him, or at least notify hiring manager that he should be given a warning regarding behavior. I mean, the difference in personal space and choreo between him and the other male dancers is astounding... He was 100% crossing the line, no question about it. Good thing is, knowing Lauren she prob did complain to management. So least that's something! /v Me da risa leer cometarios de que las chicas estn mejor sin camila . Mostrando mas quien no .pero bueno si eso las hacen feliz para ganar mas bien por ellas . /v Por que ese pinche negro manosea tanto a Lauren alv matenlo xddd a Camila no le gusta eso jejeje :v /v for me this is better than the music video /v E V E R Y T H I N G /v Normani and dinah are so hot /v  Perfect! Now that's how they should perform every time on live stage. Go big or go home! Grammy like performance if you ask me! Good job ladies! Bring the A game to every live performance! I'm rooting for u!  /v I fucking live for these girls!!! NORMANI IS A QUEEN /v I'm slayed, murdered and then totally resurrected! /v ICONIC ! QUEENZ /v I can't breathe omg! /v NORMANI BBY /v What the hell did I just watch...felt as though I was front row at a fully-clothed strip club...  /v Girls! My friend is seeking a bride! Must be white, slim as model, soft face, 1,67 cm, between 22- 25 old years.... /v 23,000 people like this shit? Wtf is wrong with people. I can see the sex sells aspect but the music is so bad. /v Not hating whatsoever but have they gained weight or is it just me ? Except for Normani I think she's still the same either way I still love them weight means nothing ,but I was just curious if it was just in my head or not /v I don't like posting negative comments and i know music is subjective, art is subjective but this is awful, mindless rubbish, people need to wake up. no offense. They have talent and they could actually influence people in a positive way but they choose to waste there talents on this. sad. /v WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!? /v I... have to go and rethink life now. /v There is no entanglement. Photons just don't experience time so when one filter changes the polarity of the entangled photon, it changes it throughout the entire existence of the photon. /v Probably missing the point entirely, but what if the blocked sunlight is instead reflected/repolarized, such that some light is passing through at the requisite angle, because it forces it to, so at each filter it's effectively a 45 degree offset instead of a full 90 degree.\n\nAnd since one of the entangled pair is being offset by this smaller amount, it also forces the other to be offset as well.\n\nEDIT: OK, I guess you did mention a hidden variable being influenced by the filter.\n\nLocality I'm willing to say might be upended in certain circumstances. Same with realism. I also have no scientific argument to support my claim. Just one that seems to sound logically sound. /v I really don't think that this kind of information is suitable for the lay public.\n\nMy education is in economics, so I'm comfortable talking both statistics and (most) other mathematics. But every time I see something about quantum entanglement/the double slit/etc, I just see a series of what I can describe as poorly designed experiments that (appear) to rely on unproven assumptions and build upon them. Clearly, they are not poorly designed; experts far more educated on the subject matter are doing them. The only thing I've really learned is that I have not been given even the basic information needed to understand let alone make a judgement about it. \n\nIt does make me concerned, especially when the information is given to the scientifically illiterate general public (one glance through this videos comments and you'll run into a deluge of pseudo-scientific babble). The reality is that information given to people without knowledge is dangerous (even if that's only in giving a false sense of understanding). Until the research is more definitive, this information seems to be best kept with the experts, however passionate they may be sharing the information with content creators and the general public. /v how do you measure how much light remains after it passes through the last filter? what if that measurement would also work like a filter, then we also got the human eye that filters and the mind behind it, probably making a big thing out of something not really special or paradoxical at all. /v Wasn't it proven that there isn't any hidden information/variable? /v I think you should look at the shape of the sin wave. \n\nOdd example. Antifreeze poisoning. I know i know hold on. The cure for anti freeze poisoning is vodka. Lots and lots of alcohol. Why? Because your body will process the antifreeze as if it were vodka based on the shape of the two molecules. \nSo if a sin wave is within that 15 percent range it will probably pass through the polarizer because it looks similar enough. \nI could be wrong but didnt some scientist show that light has memory. Passing two seperate light sources through a crystal turning one light source off but the crystal still projected the same image.\nCould light essentially squeeze through modifing the path of the photon?\n\nAlso i would reverse your perspective on the situation. What does the light look like from polerizer c's view. The path the sin wave (photon) travels from a and from a+b would be different. \nJust a late night cant sleep thought. /v 1:47 another video setting unrealistic standards for stick figures. /v A thought I had is if the particles somehow could store their choices, and entangled particles have the same stored choices, then they would behave the same way without having to interact above the speed of light /v Hello photons, do you pass through the filter? Yes or no!\n_Something, something, quantum mechanics..._ /v People who watched this video might also be interested in following two experiments that relates heavily to this topic:\nQuantum eraser - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment\nDelayed choice quantum eraser - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser\n\nIt would be cool if you could make a video about this or more QM overall. /v ... you spent 14 minutes talking about how it can't work one way. You mention offhand in the middle that that suggests it must work a second way.... And then never mention that second way again. This video would have felt a lot more meaningful if you spent some time talking about other ways it might work instead of only talking about this one way it can't possibly work. /v Why must the variable be in the photons, and not the lenses? /v Would phase change have anything to do with this? Can the filters change the frequency of light, making UV and IR into visible?\n Maybe there's some quantum property that we don't yet know of. /v Photons\nThe dicks of science /v You are trying to make us cry now... \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v collab from two of my favourite channels!! /v I fixed the experiment! \n\nA photon flying through a filter has a chance to pass through it even if it's not quite parallel.\nThis chance falls off exponentially as the difference in angle increases, up to 90 where there is a 0% chance.\n*As the photon passes through it rotates to match the angle of polarisation of the filter.*\n\nI'm sure there's some basic reason why this is wrong, it just seemed like a really obvious solution to me haha. I would really like to know why.  /v You left out light reflection of the middle lens dumb ass. I own a Orion reflector telescope 10 , so I use filters of many types for many years.  Maybe do a night vision might be helpful here boy. /v Sounds way blown out of proportion. /v I freaking hate quantum mechanics. It messes so hard with everything you've ever learned and everything you assume. I feel like Quantum Mechanics is Weird Al Yankovich singing Everything you know is wrong. /v My head can't handle this  /v This is a misunderstanding of Bell's theorem, Bell himself said it doesn't prohibit hidden variables, just LOCAL hidden variables... the wave function is global, and perfectly capable of holding values that keep things deterministic rather than probabilistic. So no, the deterministic universe has not been disproven. /v It was good if you mention that in classical view this effect is not weird at all. http://alienryderflex.com/polarizer/ /v Sorry, but you have a horrible understanding of entanglement.\nIf you fix your understanding everything will make sense. /v I bet the numbers change to 100; 75; 50 when no one is observing them. /v Why is it that locality is such a hardcore rule!!?? I mean consider quantum mechanical movement like pressure of water jet in a tunnel, a right angle direction change makes a substantial loss of pressure to heat but a directional change less than right angle can re-align the pressure in direction of movement. I mean old toilet pipes were semicircular loop and not perfect right angled to optimize water pressure through suction. /v The answer is God! Ha! Beat you to it. /v 14 minute physics...\n\nWE HAVE BEEN BLESSED FOLKS! /v Theory, the field of passing particles polarize others allowing more to pass /v Amazing collaboration!!!! I was absolutely terrified by the initial video clip of the weird Venn diagram but I get it now. This is way fricken cool. So spooky. /v has it possible that process of passing through the second filter alters the nature of those photons to make them brighter or change how they interact with additional filters? /v Time doesn't exist and there is only one photon... /v Why talk on hidden variables instead of the paradox? Made the presentation pretty muddled /v I thought adding a third linear polarization filter at something other than 90 basically converted a portion of the light polarization to circular. The cosine of the angle of the middle filter then describes the percentage of light that will pass through the the third filter. /v Does this possibly mean that some of our measurements from distant stars could be wrong? /v Tell me the conversation at the end is an excerpt from an upcoming podcast! /v The Universe is in the superposition of two states: <realism doesn't work| and <locality doesn't work| ;-) /v Is this similar to chirality /v It's because you're using circles for your diagram. /v This is sooo wrong.... Same time could be angle of observer to impact results. What would this experiment look if observer rotates? /v Just when I thought Ozmoroid a.k.a. Viascience provided me with a sound understanding of quantum mechanics  back to the drawing board. Cheers! /v I feel like you made the explanation harder than necessary. Nice vid tho, very good animations. /v I'd listen to this podcast. /v LiFi can take advantage of this /v Yay quantum physics, those physics always seem to find a way to cheat lol /v WHAT IF is does get through but we are the ones who just can't see it /v find a few prisms, place them between the filters... IT'S MAGIC /v Maybe one of the variables is the human lack of understanding on the world around us still. /v But this says minute physics and it's 17 minutes long. Fuck that. Ain't nobody got time for 17 minutes of physics! /v Oh hey look, it's the theory of everything! https://www.facebook.com/superrelativity/ /v This seems kinda obvious to me. Light is waves and you are filtering light through slits. There will be interference patterns. You also have to take into consideration how big are the slits. If you filter horizontal reflections, waves won't be perfectly vertical. There will be a little bit of play! That's why when you introduce a third slit in between, the photons that bounced on the edges on the in between slit will have different polarization from the first one, thus it will pass through the third one... That's why when you rotate only 2 filters there is 2 positions that will block the light. But when you have 3 filters there is 4 position that will block the light. /v Especially loved the conversation at the end, really added to the whole collab and friendly feel to the video! /v Then the answer is clear, the photon passes but not seen or change it form from lens to lens. /v white has all colour, time does not exist, thought effect the quantum /v This also works with those polarized 3D glasses from movie theaters /v What a long... long...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 Minutes and 34 secs later...\n\n\nLong Minute. /v You're assuming that the ability to pass through the filters happen simultaneously. Obviously having glasses and having a beard can happen simultaneously, but passing through filters happens chronologically. It can't pass through two at the same time without both filters being the same object. Your analogy is faulty and therefore you can't use the same math to describe both situations /v What if entanglement really means that in other dimensions the entangled particles are local, thus speed of  light is not violated. /v It's because reality is just a projection of two dimensional data at the advancing wave of the original Big Bang. /v So if we got 90 lenses and rotated each .1 degrees from the last, how much would get through? /v I feel like a total dunce.. /v Your best video in ages. /v The moment when you do not have correct physical model to explain something so simple.\nIt is time to bring back the Aether, do all calculations again, and forgot about light particle and photon entanglement. /v Only 15% of the information in this video filtered to my brain. /v The rectiline filters that you are using for this experiment actually influence the light that passes through it! The phenomenon that you are observing actually is explained if the filter being a non matematical object that affects the light that goes through it.This property of matter of messing with light going through it in one direction or another is called birefringence! \nImagine for a second that the filter pivots (absorbs then reemits) the light going through it just a little bit so that it aligns with the axis in wich it lets the light through. If this is the case it makes sense that the more times you pivot it the more light will pass in the end! \nThis is the concept behind some of your LCD screens! White light is always on behind every single one of the pixels of your screen. Between the front of your screen and the back there is a layer of liquid christals that block that light. When tension is aplied to a pixel little liquid christals allign with it progressively, that is to say that the christals near the back wall of the screen remain in their position and the front ones allign totally with it. Like this :  BACK   _\ |    FRONT \nThis acts like the series of filters now letting through a part of the light wich goes through a clored filter flies through the air and reaches your beatufill eyes you beautifull coment reader you!\nTo be honest I m pretty sure that there are plenty of other experiments that disprove the hidden variables (I could name a few if I tried to remember em) but this one does not ... as you cant truly say that it is the same photon that goes in a filter as the one that comes out. (FYI linear filters like this are made just by having liiitle tiiiiny wires all parallel to one another, wires being great at absorbing electromagnetic energy will only let light through the tiny gaps between them and will spit out some of that energy in the form of light aligned with em ...) /v Try this: 1st len 0, 2nd len 90 with 3rd len 0on top. The result will be 50% brightness of the original light! Wat?!  /v Wait; you said the first experiment without a loophole was in 2015, yet Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982 showing the violation earned him a Nobel prize... So what loophole is there in his experiments? /v re the patrons... is that THE Tony Fadell? like the inventor of the iPod? /v when i was 15 this stuff i can easily understand but lately [23] im getting horrible migrains. is that bad? /v I know quantum physic really good. And we used the polarisation filters a lot in school. But we only used two filters and never three. And I think this video tells my why =D I'm going to study this topic a lot more in the future when I'll graduat from university. I love quantum mechanics  /v Like minutephysics, have a beard, wear glasses. Checking in. /v And thats why you look at light as a wave function in this case with filters and it all makes sense. /v In the 1780s Immanuel Kant presaged quantum weirdness though he didn't know it at the time.  What Kant claimed in Critique of Pure Reason is that reasoning is a faculty of the brain, like digestion is a faculty of the stomach/intestines.  So Kant's claimed that if ever the mind is presented with data it can't physically digest then the data will be forever confusing and unreasonable. \n\nIn the 1780s the scientific revolution was in it's childhood, but at that point it did seem like data+reasoning was absolutely perfect and would never run into trouble. Quantum weirdness, like Bell's Theorem and double-slit experiment, et al, is, me thinks, showing up reasoning as being imperfect. If this imperfection was more widely understood then we might see a reduction in the number of hard materialists with their all is determined world view that leads to fatalism and human conflict. /v You two should have a podcast. /v If you can't explain something in a simple way, you don't understand it yourself. /v i fuck with a random universe HEAVY hidden variables swallow balls /v The two of you should do a podcast. /v I love both of these channels and it was amazing to see this collaboration! /v I have a question about the experiment:\nFor the filters 1 , 2 and 3 at the time index 1:05. After inserting the 3rd filter between 1 and 2.\nDid you tried to  further rotate the 2nd filter until a point  which perpendicular to the 3rd filter?\nif so What happened to the intensity of the light then? \nI wonder if it becomes dark again. \nIf I find some filters I will try it myself also. /v 17minutephysics /v 3Blue1Brown sounds a lot like CGPGrey. /v Im stupid /v 3Blue1Brown is the bomb /v Lost me around 11:00 /v I liked this but stil.. 20minutesearth /v I understood nothing /v Is that MORDICHI!  /v it doesnt look brighter at all wtf is thisvideo even on aobut /v ?CONFUSION ALERT?!!!!!!! /v Damn physics, you scary. /v im a magnet! /v FSM Confirmed. 5:37 /v I'm hungry /v great video, ignore the haters /v Sheldon??? /v Thats amazing /v AHHHH STOP IT!!!!\n\nIMMA GET A FUCKING SEZIURE /v Your content is good, but the word is NOT ex spearmint. Your accent is not your fault, but I'm guessing your pronunciation of the word grates on a lot of viewers, esp from British/Australian backgrounds. If you practice sounding out each syllable: ex speh rih ment (emphasising the i after the r being most important - should sound like ex spare ribbon) you will no doubt annoy people less with that. Yes, I realise most people (mostly Americans) will find this comment obnoxious :P /v Don't touch her said peacefully by bella.\nTMZ Holy shit bella hadid almost whooped a security guards ass. /v Yeah that's so wrong... I understand how annoying a paparazzi can be, but when they are men, celebrities like her doesn't mind security to beat the hell out of them but when is a woman behind the camera they can't touch her? Equal rights where???? /v what the hell? he was just doing his job /v So it's only bad when this photog(who happens to be a woman) gets treated like this, not when a male photog gets treated the same? I wonder where all this sexism and discrimination comes from. Hmmm... /v She isn't even the fucking president \nGet the fuck outa hea /v bitchs want equal rights...... and lefts /v Stupid bitch, the security is trying to protect her lol /v This bitch is walking around like she owns the sidewalk. I woulda knocked one of em out /v more celebs need to be like this. i know security is there for a reason, but thats not to physically move innocent people out of the way. that is assault /v yeah Bella /v Publicity stunt once again /v The comments for this video are just stupid /v Yolanda and Muhammad raise their kids well /v did you just assume her gender? /v Wait bitch.. Isn't this what you hire security for? Ditch the gaurds with your level of fame and see how long your morals keep you from falling under a stampede. /v Who the fuck is this chick anyways?? /v This chick takes messy wet poops like the rest of us. /v Should say Stupid SJW Screams at White Male for Doing the Job She Pays Him for Because Feminism\n\n /v Who cares, also why is this trending? /v C\nL\nI\nC\nK\nB\nA\nI\nT /v I respect her for that, some security guards are too rough and don't care if they hurt people. /v La is so gay. look at all those people treating another human like something other.I came across this vid Im so glad I'm out of the TV loop. 8 years .I have no idea who these people are.god we are living in the lamest of times /v We didn't get to see how the security guard actually moved the lady so that sucks! /v The hero we need /v He shoved that one dude so hard and she doesn't say a word but as soon as he even touches the chick she says to stop being so rough. Modern Feminism at it's finest. /v fuck this bitch, guys were getting pushed and shoved and she said nothing.  One touch to a woman and its red alert.  Where is all that equality now? /v Can't see the initial interaction between the photog & bodyguard, and judging whether gender politics were a factor w/o footage is a non-starter. What you can see is a model who's paying attention to the interactions between her security and the paparazzi. Lots of celebs turn a blind eye. Or take the tack that photographers are evil, so whatever security does to them is fine. Whether Miss Hadid read the situation correctly (that her bodyguard's actions posed a physical threat to the photographer) is less important, IMO, then that she intervened (politely!) to diffuse a situation she thought might be/become dangerous to another person. Whom she had no responsibility to care for.\n\nSpeaking as a former security guard. It's very easy, when you're in that hyper-vigilant mindset, to become overzealous in the way you protect your client. /v What a bunch of parasites. /v Now we're going to see a surge in female paparazzi because they'll be able to get close enough for that money shot /v I think that was like super nice /v Who the fuck is Bella Hadid?\n*rhetorical question\nI really could care less. /v You had one job....one job!!!! /v Stupid liberals loves their celebrities who has nothing to be loved for no talent no brain no morality only outside look /v I'd smack that hoe right across the face if she grabbed me /v Its not about being equal, it about being logical. Most of the time a woman will be weaker and smaller than a man, especially a body guard. /v Never been a huge fan of her but I really admire her doing this! /v Bella is going cop so much shit by the anti-Feminism individuals who are easily threatened by it. I praise her for doing the right thing against unreasonable force. I do hope though that any bouncer she has who uses unreasonable force towards male photographers that she pulls them up about it too, unreasonable violence is still unreasonable violence regardless of gender. /v Bella >>> Gigi. Also how dare her employee talk back to her like that /v 1. Can you pls dont touch her? is not proper english.\n2. Fucking film horizontally next time, jesus christ save us all. /v I thought they were all bitches /v Paid photogs fighting with paid security... who? Oh nobody, that's right. Why is that nobody walking around an entire city block. /v She could have killed him like that what was she thinking. \n\n\n\n\nFuck tmz /v Body guard should've punched her in the stomach. /v whats a Bella Hadid and why does it have all this attention, not to mention security??? /v I don't like Paps but the Paul Blart type was a douche... /v Who is Bella, and why should we care? /v I filmed a UFO!  : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7-3ZGj4KU0 /v Man, she sure roughed him up /v If a female photographer is being aggressive and isn't moving out of the way when asked then push her out of the way just as you would a male photographers. But also security should be able to do their job and protect their clients but not go over board and harm someone. /v These celebrity kids talent is become a model  SMH to have famous parents /v There goes his job.... /v Who the fuck is Bella Hadid? /v Notice how the security guards are pushing all the male photographers out of the way, but as soon as one pushes the female photographer, Bella gets pissy. /v Fucken hoe, don't hire security if you don't want them to do their job properly /v Look at me!  I'm going to publicly scold a security guard I am paying for doing his job.  Why?  I want the world to see how compassionate and concerned about the welfare of the little people.  The same little people I demand security to keep away from me.  To top it off I will go out of my way the cameras see me reach out to this riffraff by asking Are you Okay?  All the idiots who see this will buy into the ploy that I am Mother Theresa. /v Women were so powerful hear us ROAR!! We can hang with the boys and do anything a man can do Also......... DON'T FUCKING TOUCH WOMEN!!!! /v Why are people getting mad at the model for this video on the trending page?? Get mad at tmz shes just living her life /v that was nice of bella /v white women going extinct when white men invent the ai and the artificial wombs deus vult /v double standard there, when the security pushing the male photog, she was fine. but when it was female, she became angry /v That fat slob tried to push a female fucking coward!  /v Hardly a rough up but nice of her to step in /v Dumbass liberal. Don't hire them then /v My wife is so sweet /v So it's ok if the security roughs up a man but not a woman, and it's ok when a woman roughs up a security man? Wooooooooooow and they gonna hide behind fake feminism /v Stupid bitch! Are you trained in Dignity Protection? I am and that innocent looking female could turn into your worse nightmare in a sec. Whatever security firm is under her employ needs to drop her quick. I guarantee if that female would have pulled out a knife and tried or was successful in stabbing her, she would sue the shit out of them. Just because your good at one thing does not mean your an expert at them all. /v lol she doesn't need protection from photogs. She = $$$ to them. /v _I'M A WOMAN!_\n\n- *Cat Woman* /v Feminists are garbage. /v Can't touch a girl like that but it's okay to do it to a man? And this whole world is preaching about equality. Haha my ass /v Who is she? /v Equality lmao /v Lovely bella hadid  /v Yasss Bella /v TMZ is cancer /v Slore /v  *roughs up*  /v That title tho /v Feminist's. Fvcking Feminist's. /v Screw whoever recorded vertically /v Go Bella!!!! /v Watch my YouTube videos /v he fired /v staged /v She can suck my cook /v Stfu Bella /v The accents lol /v HERE BEFRE 1K? /v So stupid /v Feminism.... /v Bella is better than selena /v You go BELLA /v good for her /v I like to see another angle because it looks like Bella actually physically handled him more than he physically handed that woman photog /v Coup de pub pour bella ... /v He stayed back after that  prolly felt like an idiot!! But her gesture was too sweet. Nice to see celebs having real feelings. /v Bella is so sweet. /v Thumbs up gurl /v Bitch is famous for nothing. /v An idiot pushing an idiot for pushing an idiot. Beam me up, Scotty...there's no intelligent life down here. /v Some in the comments claiming the phone was restarted but restart message on iPhone clearly states restart as the reason for extra authentication. Failed Touch ID attempts on the other hand will eventually result in the message Craig got on stage. Try it yourself, repeatedly touch you iPhone sensor with the wrong finger and you'll eventually get Your passcode is required to enable Touch ID.\n\nThe telling moment for me is when he rubs his face. The way he rubbed his face instantly implies he's had an issue previously. Granted, it could have been a nervous rub... Time will tell. Either way, I remain skeptical of face unlock in general. There's something about the motion and visual obstruction that hasn't grown on me. Maybe Apple will do it better or maybe we'll just deal with pass codes (many still do anyway). /v adfadfadsfasdfadsfafdaf /v Android ics have it /v Irisssssssss scanner /v HO-HO-HO /v Failphone X /v Missing Steve jobs /v girls with makeup tho :D /v Probably men makeup /v Ho ho ho....santa is coming.... /v fake ID /v Idk how identically identical twins are? /v Bullshit video...do you have iphone /v Damn iphone that embarassing, haha galaxy s8 more superior /v RIP apple /v Samsuck lol /v Apple is finished /v iPhone X Look So ugly  Special  Placement /v  /v Good job /v hmmmmmm.... /v Swipe to unlock is back guys :) literally \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoHoHo :) /v *HO HO HO* /v Great analysis on that skin idea /v Samsung Galaxy sucks balls. No for real. I used to be a Samsung homer. Til I tried iPhone. Can hardly wait for November 3!! /v All along I've wondered why they didn't incorporate a fingerprint sensor into the Apple logo on the back of the device.... /v MAKE SURE TO KEEP YOUR FACE STAY CLEAN FROM OIL /v What If I had a pimples,do they still work? /v Sounds like this fails the makeup test!  /v Just because you were not invited to event ! \nExpect better from you than this. /v lol I honestly think the phone was restarted. I get that exact message when I do it, the rubbing of the face? Haha I think shes just nervous of course (hes also rubbed his face in a similar way in previous events) and everyone is reading too much into every move they literally make, poor Apple needs to be given a break /v u r right man -_- ipone x S**** i love apple touch ID .... btw they can make their  back logo into a touchID and new Face id ... :/ in front then why they do that :/ , and back apple logo into a  touchid looks super cool i think they should do that :/ /v i dont understand why no just put a fingerprint scanner on the apple in the back /v I hate iphone  my iphone locked for 24,608,233 minutes and i have to wait for 10 years or more to be able to use my password  so go to hell iphone /v Face ID will not fail and is more secure than Touch ID other wise Apple wouldn't use it. The scanner doesn't change if you are shiny because in an video apple did the girl had just been swimming. The scanner uses a 3D version of your face and the reason why it didn't work on stage was because the phone said you need to type in your code before using Face ID So I know this will work 99% /v ALl apple is trash. want a great working device just stay home where your save and use a pc. phones come out every 3 months and every1 running to buy wasting money while the world is starving..Just so you can show your shitty phones to your friends..all phones since 2013 is a mini computer you don't need a new phone every 6 months.. /v The best part isn't that the face recognition didn't work, it's that he switched to a different phone. How did no one else catch that? It fails, then he sets it down and picks up the second phone that was sitting on the stand. No one else is commenting on this? /v Samsung phones have it too /v That wasnt a fail... it happened cause he restarted the phone and it needed the password to enable the FaceID. /v Here you go you hater People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time, says a rep, and didnt realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After failing a number of times, because they werent Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode. In other words, Face ID worked as it was designed to. /v Me too have been sceptical about this  Face ID  technology from Apple. \n\nTouch ID has been soo soo good yet Apple just planning to remove it in their new Flagship Phone ?!?!\n\nI still remember how good is Touch ID with 6s when people saying it is too fast to recognize your fingerprint, yet now Apple ditched it...\n\nI know Edge to Edge screen is great but this is a phone we're talking about, a daily device which we will use all the time. And I think it is much more natural to simply use your fingerprint than your face to unlock the device /v Why would i need a bezeless phone? Myself could make many mistakes if using it. Whatever, budget planning goes to S7. /v Even it works. Lol people can just hold up the phone to your face. How secure is that! /v Failed 2x in a row!!! Pathetic! Let me say that again Pathetic!! /v Technology is too young to be put out there so fast. Everything seems to be fantastic and yeah don't get me wrong it does look nice but reliability is where these companies are lacking, everyone wants the new this and the new that But no one, is realizing that all this could fail and not go as planned. I love where the companies are going but they have to understand that technology is too young to be put out there so fast with these new designs and softwares. /v That finger print scaner has to be there I will miss it /v The X is delayed due to production limitations. /v I am getting GALAXY NOTE 8 /v s8 is far better than iphone x...s8 has given various options to unlock--fingerprint, face recognition, eye sensor, pattern, password, pincode....s8 has more features, looks better, is cheaper....iphone is only popular because it is from the country of Hollywood.... /v I feel we just got Touch ID not too long ago & theyre trying to due away with it already?! I prefer Touch ID. Put it in the screen (if possible) or make it into the Apple logo on the back (not obviously). /v I'm Hardcore apple but im super iffy about upgrading from my 7+ 256gb , the only thing that would motivate me to do it would be the camera. \n\nOther than that, this is the first year since the iPhone 6 that I WILL NOT be purchasing apples flagship phone.\n\nI thought definitely when they ditched the headphone jack that USB C charging ports would come the next design. That would have made sense. And oh man I'm going to miss touch ID when it's gone in the next 4-6 years. \n\nBtw am I the only one that thinks the iPhone X looks like a droid. /v You're grasping for straws with this explanation, Lou. It's not a big deal at all. Everybody chill /v We noticed that he changed the iPhone and bingo it worked. I believe that the first iPhone was not set for Craig face that's why it didn't unlock check it out again and see urself /v I love to put aux cord in my phone,,\n\n\n\n\n\nOh boy /v They should make touch id in back  make the apple logo become a touch id  /v God who cares everytime my s8+ restarts I have to type in my password before I can use the Iris scanner or the fingerprint scanner. Not that big of a deal... It's a safety feature actually /v just it work when i grow beard /v And this is why I'm not an early adopter. /v What if I get a black eye or cut on my face /v Who would want faceID? You need to be in a lit room, point it square at your face, and swipe up. What if you're lying in bed in the middle of the night or you're in a meeting and you want to unlock it on the DL? /v i want it to have touch id again /v And you are unboxing what exactly here? /v That phone is weak /v I really dont like Face ID on the iPhone X . I feel like its a downgrade from Touch ID which takes just milliseconds to unlock a phone.\n\nI'll be getting the X version ii if it receives second generation Face ID /v I  think touch ID is better \nIn saudia arabia the women's she can't use iphone x because abayaa /v Didn't you notice that he changed the phone? /v what if you are sleeping and other took you'r iphone X and place in front of your face then also the phone unlocks then whats the security of 3d face lock /v Didnt they say that every time you scans your face to unlock the phone it gets better at recognizing and learning your facial features making it easier to unlock later on? /v people, it's just a DEMO i mean look at fifa for example it has the worst demos ever like when the players hit themselves instead of the ball, no one would want that, yet it's one of the most popular games of it's solid sleek and smooth gameplay but that's when the game is officially launched /v So many iPhone X users will not be able to unlock their device this Halloween. /v Does anybody else think of theft problems with the face ID payments?\n\nThief with gun: Give me your phone\nIphone X user: Ok, here, take it.\nThief with gun turning phone to owner: Thanks for unlocking it, bitch /v iSheep will still blindly follow and pour their money into the company despite getting an iStick put up their a** everyday. Ahh, mob mentality. /v Also if you wear glasses it could not work as well like for me I wear glasses and the snapchat filters don't really work /v You can't use paper just hack into it while there sleeping  lol /v Wtf why you fucktards are blowing this way out of proportion. Make a video which teaches not what stuffs biased exaggerated opinions one's throat. It was not a finished product. /v The face ID didn't fail. It was already in passcode mode because before the event people who handled the iPhone had by mistakenly authenticated too many times /v unbox Therapy , you made me lough so hard on the face id fail /v Now that Apple got all your finger prints, now they need your face to go with finger print /v People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time, says a Apple rep, and didnt realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After failing a number of times, because they werent Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode. In other words, Face ID worked as it was designed to. /v This feature debuts in Android way earlier than iPhone.. This feature is a part of Android 4.0 Ice cream sandwich, But apple claims that their face id is more accurate & has 3D face regognition.. Agreed\n\nBut to be very frank we can't rely on it.. as sometimes it unlocks your phone by seeing your sibling/Mother/father face with whom you're resembling to.\n\nAnd it doesn't unlock in every scenario.. Even Android wouldn't unlock when I used to change hairstyle \n\nApple could be more accurate but it can't be perfect, same happened with the guy at stage had some sweat on his face and phone didn't unlock  /v Or maybe that gesture was a safe-rescue gesture just in case face recognition won't work during the presentation? :D /v Reflective substance on a face Eh? Infrared is good. Wheres the UV cam guys. i mean cummon! /v Gonna wait for the actual product and compare it with the next google pixel to see which one is better.\nSeriously, when you see a tech company showing a talking poop and talk about emojis for more than 10 mins in a two hour conference which was supposed to be a hardware debut event, you can tell there's sth wrong with them. /v I like the fingerprint sensor in all my devices. especially my old dell xps 15. i can unlock the my phone simultaneously while i pull it out of my pocket, its so  efficient . i hate when people remove it for aesthetic reasons /v Heres what an Apple rep said about the debacle:\n\nPeople were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time, says a rep, and didnt realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After failing a number of times, because they werent Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode. In other words, Face ID worked as it was designed to. /v If Face ID is the future, why is Apple looking to add an onscreen fingerprint scanner? iPhone X is perfect for the man/woman with money to spare, but I really need more convincing. Maybe iPhone 11 will be the real iPhone to buy. /v Way to go SAMSUNG!!!! /v And yet android does that for ages and Samsung too /v when an iphone restart....first it will ask for the passcode.\nThats y it was not recognising the face id. /v My bigger problem is that someone can unlock the phone without me knowing it. Say, a boyfriend can unlock my phone while I'm sleeping: simply hold the phone up to my face and that's it. The fingerprint ID is better because at least I might feel how someone touches my hand/fingers to unlock a phone, with face ID it's a no-contact operation. So... it's a privacy issue. /v imagine having a twin and they grab your phone. /v are you covering the apple company. as if you want us to buy the iphone. just face it, its the stupidest thing to unlock a phone with a face. the worst failure happens in live audiences. this is not what steve job would want. /v When you got accident, surely this feature is broken /v But what if you have a Twin?? /v you would have to be totally stupid if you willingly handed over your face print directly to the alphabet agencies in use of this technology /v So I can just put this phone infront of my friend's face quickly and it will unlock???? Stealing phones have never been so easy. /v How about we wait for reviews with device in hand before we jump to conclusions. /v if someone set up the Face ID, then got an accident, and eventually got a scar on his/her face, and also forgot his passcode..... /v it was a mistake because during the rehersal the crew was constantly testing the face id and since it wasnt craig's face, it didnt open and hence, the screen appeared where u have to put in the password like in ur normal phone ,if u put several wrong fingerprints, it asks for the passcode . the same thing happened here with face id. /v @Unbox Therapy I hope you know that you're an asshole for making this kind of videos. But who cares right? /v Hey! I know that ladybug! His name is Jonathan! /v the song is so catchy dammit!

Right as they finished, the fire engine caught aflame and they actually put it out with the juice from this chicken. It's that good. Tragically their chicken was dry after the effort and they had to make a new batch. /v how tf do you only have 800k subs?

Can't wait /v If you were this small you would get eaten by animals. /v Dear trailer, thank you for showing me the entire fucking movie. /v I wonder what is cgi Matt damon or the fucking tulip. @ 1:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah I know I know its just a big fucking tulip handcrafted /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v This video is a tribute to the lives lost September 11, 2001 and all the brave men and women who died of illness years after participating in the rescue and recovery effort.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zz11ZTB9Mdg\n\n#Don't forget 9/11 /v What about rain and wind? ... lol...... another stupid global warming based movie ... no thanks /v FUUUUUCK THAT \nIMAGINE SPIDERS, WORMS AND ALL THIS INSECT BIGGER THEN YOU\n\n\nMILLIONS OF THEM \n\nand lets not talk about the Giant Killer Cats that will toy with you once that small /v So...what happened to his wife? /v Omg I neeeeed to watch this movie date anyone?  /v That really stupid movies ever I see when small people can kill by oxygen air with weight of gravity and too highly deadly oxygen. /v Someone must have been high as shit to think of this /v 0:32 that's my school! /v would have been a great black mirror episode /v Hope we all good /v imagine trying to drink water and have a drop of water stuck to your face suffocating you or trying to drink water out of a tiny plastic bottle but it's stuck cuz of water tension and won't come out of the bottle /v Anyone heard of the old movie 'The Incredible Shrinking Man'? Try that one before watching this movie. /v I'll bet they use a lot of the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids situations /v To me this is something the elites would try and do to the masses whilst they remained normal size. all the earths population could be controlled by them in a single place and easily disposed of if needed. Lol /v Cool idea, but apparently humans would *not* survive if they were shrunk like this, they would freeze to death. Something related to body heat conservation, it seems.\n\nJust saying. If anyone else mentioned this already, sorry, my bad. :P /v This looks like something Charlie Kaufman would write. /v Good luck when an earthquake hits.  /v Irreversible? Fuck that! Who else thinks this is creepy af? /v I can't wait to watch this movie. /v It's a TRICKY predictive mental diversion ! What's really being said here is that you're no longer needed and will be EXTERMINATED! HUMAN EXISTENCE WILL BE DOWNSIZED!  /v Okay, so basically I don't care about this movie at all, but I heard Talking Heads and I HAD to fucking watch the whole trailer UGGGGH, they're so good! /v First thing you do is check your Penis ! Absolutely /v Getting partial Black Mirror vibes, but it looks lighthearted enough to not go that route. /v its all fun and games until some drunk fucker decided to play god and stomp on a city /v This movie looks like shit covered hemorrhoids after gay anal sex. /v Reminds me of this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5fqQW_vxc /v I have so many questions that probably won't be answered in this movie. /v This is the kind of movie that will have a commercial saying ITS THE FEEL GOOD MOVIE OF THE YEAR /v it's never been the amount of people who live here that are the problem, it's HOW WE LIVE that's the problem. /v I'd be very nervous about being squished. /v @1:18: TINY WOMAN IN TINY GLASS WINDOW BOX: Nervous?\n\nME: Nope... 'Cause I ain't a crazy ass like you. /v the prop department must have had a lot of fun making this one /v What happens if a spider gets into tiny town... /v Looks cool but wtf would drastically lower themselves in the food chain like that?  Now even cockroaches would F you up stupid. /v Even I can't fap to this... /v Wow this looks so interesting! I'm actually really looking forward to watching it! /v You have it set to M for mini, when it should be set to W for wumbo /v Wow, cant wait for Honey, I shrunk the kids 3.\n\nedit: Dang it! I swear i came up with this on my own. /v Congratulations, you get Downsized and you instantly die of suffocation.  You're smaller, but the atoms of oxygen don't get smaller.  Good luck having your lungs absorb that precious, precious air you need to breathe. XD /v Only Talking Heads music can make a stupid fucken movie seem ok /v Down sizing? I've been recommending downsizing since I started working here. I even brought it up in my interview... /v this the origin  of Attack on Titan LOL /v I'm getting some Black Mirror vibes from this /v Looks fun! Has that feel good unique film vibe such as Pleasantville (1998). /v Redbox instant classic /v So......what's the conflict? /v SUDS! /v This actually looks really intriguing.  Creative idea! /v Macrophilia! /v Rats & Cats /v Wtf? /v but spiders tho. fuck that /v I'm excited /v This looks freaking amazing... /v best picture contender /v Honey I Shrunk the boring dialog actors! /v and queue distopia (key song lyric  my God what have I done) /v Anyone else think it was a horror film at first? /v hahahahahahahaha...i really hope none of the tech billionaires get excited about this. /v *Talking heads!* /v instant classic! /v Downsize everything expect my di*k /v 0:07 Kongre Merkezi -> As bayraklar as /v Imagine the rule34 tho /v Great song. Shitty movie. /v Why is he wearing a name tag with my name on it ? /v fascinating... but I wouldn't do it.. why? because at any moment someone can step on you and there would be no way to protect yourself against that. /v can u do one hands off now? /v Please give Oneplus 5 vs iPhone X speed test video /v iPhone 8 =iPhone hate!! \n\niPhone x = phone mess!! /v hey /v The 8 still has bezzles.. /v iPhone 10 /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DxqJ8VJkiQ    \niPhone X  full specification /v MY LOVELY BLACK MAN . /v good /v Hands on? Haha. /v Trending /v I want it /v Me /v Wow /v I hope I get an iPhone /v Did someone noticed ijustine at 3:13 /v wow super beautiful /v Awesomeee /v Looks like MQBHD got some competition... /v iPhone xxxxxxxxxxx /v MAA BOII ON TRENDING /v They look dope /v Are you that hyped about the X? Lmao Guess it doesn't take much to convince Apples . /v Lol I honestly don't know if it's worth it just got my s8 plus I love it so much... iris scanner works super fast! Impressed me took time to get used to but now in my 3rd week /v The iPhone 8 still looks like the freaking iPhone 6 on the front after like what 3 years since the 6 design was released? Sad. and the iPhone X is a fucking disaster, the GALAXY S6 EDGE has a better design, don't even deny, i know you know lmao. The top left and top right corner on the X is a tragedy. No thank you. Face ID lmao what innovation I've had that on my Ice Cream Sandwich android phone 4 YEARS AGO. \n\ndon't get me wrong i actually love and use a couple of apple products but i don't doubt apple will end up like nokia couple of years from now. rip innovation /v iPhone X has small sizes Not worth the price. /v Iphone x is ugly like if u agree /v Hey iPhone X looks dope, give me it if you want me to have it, idc if I lose I'll honestly probably work for it and get the money in 2 months. Keep up the good work UAC /v i'm definetly getting the 8 plus /v Face ID = putting your face on a database. /v Great video. I watched the live event and you covered it in a short amount of time. Plus getting a video up so fast after.   /v Apple once again relying on brain dead fanboys to buy   older tech married to awesome cameras. Wireless charging? The Note 4 had it. No physical button? Easily a 5 year old idea. But hey these things are made for hipsters, high schoolers, and girls. They're pop culture. /v Xxxtentasion is the type of nigga who thinks I phone x is made up of his name /v Does swiping up give a haptic/Taptic feed back?????? /v im probably gonna get the 8 in silver /v Cool video but I already have a phone with a glass/metal build, high quality edge to edge display, wireless (fast) charging, facial recognition, great dual optically image stabilized cameras, and IP68 water/dust resistant. It also has a headphone jack and a stylus. Maybe the IPhone 11 will have the courage to include a headphone jack. /v Can someone please explain to me how wireless charging works if u need to be using your phone while it's charging? Or how you would charge your phone in your car if it's wireless? Since there's no more headphone jack either, how is that beneficial for people that don't have Bluetooth in their car and use aux jack to play music? These upgrades don't seem all that great to me. /v Idk about you guys, but Touch ID was not really reliable... after a year with my iPhone 6, it started being less reliable and now at year three it's almost useless... /v I love your content!!! /v The next thing will be the... ichip in your blood stream..! /v What's the point of wireless if you can't use it while it's charging /v One is overpriced and the other is VERY overpriced /v I'm a big fan of apple/iphones, but the samsung galaxy is basically the iphone x, except it came out 2 years ago and is way cheaper /v Really don't like these new iphones. I guess I'll just see how long I can last with my 7plus...... /v Real awesome video man. Want one too. But am on the other side of earth, Africa Zambia. /v For me the most impressive is the super oled display, not face id. It is really really beautiful ! /v Finallyyy someone showed something new - switching apps back and forth on X is super coooool  Thanks man /v lmao does this mean that the iphone 5s will be like 50$? /v Am I the only person thats uncomfortable with how the back camera being vertical  /v The footage of the new iphones you got were incredible! Also quick question, does anyone know if the iphone 7 plus cases with fit the iphone 8 plus? I'm upgrading from a iphone 5c to a iphone 8 plus and already own a few 7+ cases. /v iPhone x is sick but I rather the 8 plus /v Despite cost, the X appears to be the one to go for. However, it's funny how no one is talking about the *ears* and how that impacts the view of the video. The *face ID only* feature seems a bit curious as well. Time or parts constraints, I'm guessing  /v i wish I could get one . i have a shitty Samsung grand prime /v Why didn't they drop a iPhone 9? Because 7, 8, 9. HAHAHA get it? /v Does the iPhone X have stereo speakers? /v You know what? Fuck me. I just got an iPhone 7 last month. I had extra money that I could have used for a iPhone X but I used it on other things. I was just all like oh I gotta get a new phone but I should have waited. /v Pppl outside america so mad that they have to pay extra. What else do you expect pay less its a fkn American made product. Why don't you try to make your iPhones instep of complaining over and over. /v I need that phone bro giveawyyy to meee /v It's all about that X /v The thing that separated the iPhone with Samsung was the home button lol now basically this iPhone seems like an a Samsung phone and this is coming from a iPhone fan boy I switched from note because the home button was easy to easy! I see this as a hassle and mistake by apple ... sighing a tad they will realize this and return the home button /v That new IPhone X is the best iphone ever /v Iphone 8 looks the same as iphone 7!?!?! Seriously the update?!?! Buy a Decent dslr instead... /v Apple's all new iPhone X aka a failed attempt at making a Samsung Galaxy note. \nTables have turned LMAO. /v The Future of cellphones are Near /v I hit the subscribe button \nI also turned on notifications /v +UrAverageConumer Hey This Is Abhijeet. Please Can  I Have Only The Base IPhone 8 Not Even The 8+ But Please I Have Never Owned An Apple Product. And If You Let Me Own My First Apple Product That would Be awesome.\n\n\n\n\nThanks For Reading The Comment And Hope You Will Fulfill My Wish. /v I love this phone notifications on  /v i will just say NOTE 8 /v iJustine was in this /v I need the 8 plus. I don't want to lose my collecters edition Red iPhone 7 plus /v I'm pumped so I hit that like button. /v I am going to the market now to buy Iphone9 /v best product they made was the SE /v No one wants a phone just for a cooler camera and minor power upgrades. /v Android did all this first and better /v God Id love any of these 3 phones ! Im still using the iPhone 5s broke nessssss its ok though i guess Ill have to save up ! /v ....fingerprints.....Facebook and face id.  Could it be any easier to find out everything bout us /v Does the iPhone x still have stereo speakers?? On the top and bottom /v I would like the 8 /v Great video like always. I'm an Android user but the X actually makes me want to switch. Would be neat if I landed one. /v Every iPhone video ends up with thousands of comments arguing about why one phone is better than the other, meanwhile I just want a phone that is cheap... The phone looks great but the only way I'd get it was if i got it for free *wink wink... Seriously, at this point phones cost as much as laptops and tablets /v Not at all impressed. I'm waiting to see what the next Pixel comes out with next month. If they're not impressive, I'll either buy last year's model, or go to a Nokia, Motorola, or older iPhone model. /v Keep it up do your videos the same as these I love it /v I have the se, I won't be getting this because it's nothing different from the iPhone 6. /v Saw iJustine can you guys do a collab /v You have a s8 upgrading to the IPhone 10 more like *downgrading* /v Can I be entered in the give away plz /v he's not average any more /v Every time I see your face I can't forget about what you said one time. I've been subscribed to you for a really long time and I remember before you even had 100k subs I remember you said guys, I'm not rich, I'm just your average consumer I find that funny though because every time you release a video, you always have some expensive gadget that I've never had before. even back then, it was the same case. Funny  /v Who else is watching this vid on an iPhone??if not it's all good /v IS NO ONE GOING TO MENTION IN ANY OF THESE VIDEOS ABOUT THE IPHONE 9? WHERE ARE YOU 9?!?!?? /v Question which one is Best.   \nGalaxy note 8 \nGalaxy S8 Plus \nIPhone X\nIPhone 8 Plus /v Wanna hear a joke \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPhone 9 is coming on 2025  /v Omg they make the same phone every year... and they stole Samsung ideas Apple running out of ideas but y'all clown androids. /v The X stands for Xpensive /v The difference between the iPhone 8 & 6plus & 7 is nothing because there exactly the same  /v whos else is watching this on a iphone 8? /v I love it's design /v I did it /v Fun Fact: S8 has headphone jack /v You rock brother keep it up we love you and I'm a gaint fan ,God bless you /v Midnight train to Memphis /v Shit. /v I hate this pseudo country bullshit /v great song /v Awesome song /v cuck /v Kid Rock for Senate!! /v Very nice song!!!! /v Awesome song kid rock! /v God bless Kid Rock! /v Senator ROCK /v inyarwanda /v Hey Kid...Lets eat some BarBq next Saturday? /v love it /v ts cool /v Bruh...............smfh.............how BAD is this  /v Yass Fuck i love this !! /v s  /v I love you, Jimmie. /v Kid Rock 2020 /v kkona /v dont you mean SENATOR rock? /v  /v Rock on my bratha /v how is this trending?! /v Omigod.

Run for Senate and FOOK all these criminal Leftist  politicians that only fight for status quo and not for their constituents. Detroit = shit hole. Democrats ran it to the ground. And they dont give AF about anyone, much less blacks, whites, Asians, latinos. And watch em now label you a racist or a xenoohobe. I see you Left, shaking... /v Hey kid rock. Welcome back. Nobody missed you. What's wrong shit head? Run out of you piggy bank and now you decided to suck off some more corporate Jews producers for another shot at giving the world watered down drivel that only sounds good in a Texaco bathroom. /v Too bad he is a racist mother fucker. /v The only kid rock song I remotely remember is the one with lil Wayne.

This is so true, and so sad. I believe it's partly because indiepop is considered (mislabeled) rock today (i.e. 21 Pilots and Lorde) /v I Really Love Kids Voice. /v When your next senator releases a new song... /v What about your new song Engine 9 with Yelawolf when does that drop? /v just stop....wow this was bad /v Thank you for the good music!!! /v god isn't real /v Poser /v Fucking simpleton music. /v gfys kr & dt45 2 /v Fuck Kid Rock.

Seriously benign, uninspired, and droning.  And I'm from Tennessee.  Fuck off, KR /v Well that was some of the most stupid lyrics I've heard. /v I'm from TN and this is just Shit!! /v this makes me wanna crack open a warm keystone and fuck my sister /v This shit trash and I thought you from Detroit /v Fuck kid rock music suck and that fool from Southfield not 313 bitch ass trash ass /v Don't promote Tennessee, we don't want anymore to move here. Half-back everywhere. (People who move to Florida, hate it as much as the North, so relocate half-backWe love her just the way she is... /v What a shitty song. Sounds as incoherent as Jake Paul with a country accent. You bro country hipster you've have no idea what a country song is, listen to some actual country song and notice the great themes they usually capture, just drunkenly slurring out a few familiar words doesn't make it a country song. /v If anyone from Detroit is listening you need to cone pick up Kid Rock, nobody here in TN asked for a song. /v What the fuck is this shit? I hate this song more than I hate dick. /v Why the FUCK is this bullshit on trending it barely has views /v kid rock sucks and his a rebel traitor.hang this scum! /v Just need spiked tea and women to grab by the pussy!

You are so inspirational and beautiful and I love you!!! :) /v Your Makeup looked so flawless  lots of greetings from germany /v Great vlog as always. It works. Don't worry. /v Really digging your music transitions and how seamless they are from in the vid to your earbuds to the speaker. It's a small detail but I really love the time you're taking to do it. /v Is this with the g7x now? It's amazing and editing and music and content is on point! /v the editing of your blog gets better and better everytime you upload a new one. i love that your blogs aren't always about the same things. i'm sure this consumes a lot of your time and effort but i wanted to thank you for sharing such good content :) thank you claire and love you! /v hey claire, edit my life please! you're so rad. i have to ask, when you're running around place to place all day do you bother do use your manual settings on the camera or do you just put it on auto? i'm so bad if i'm in and out everywhere eventually i just do auto [don't tell my teachers! lol] /v This is SO GOOD per usual You're just so incredibly creative! Love that light-switch & wake-up..but I don't know how you leave that GLORIOUS BED!! I was laughing at the one-handed wipes removal & t-rex handBoth the bun & s-curl hair technique at Cynthia Rowley were perfection! ANY feedback on your makeup roll?? Such a fantastic idea for not only brushes but stick makeup, mascara & other tools! /v Claire I've been watching your videos for SO MANY YEARS NOW, and your vlogs (esp the NYC ones) will always be my favorite. You SLAYIN it. I love you  /v I've made it my mission to visit NY next year, your videos are getting me so excited  /v I love love love your videos and the way you edit them :) /v Hey! I'm planing my first ever trip to the New York and was wondering if you have any good hotel recommendations in NYC. Great vlogs as usual! have a nice day  /v Eeeeek seeing you rub your eyes so roughly has me yelling noooooooooo! at the computer haha. Your skin must be strong af to not have huge bags in that area by now. I just turned 35 and even though I've been told my whole life that skin is really thin and fragile DON'T EVER RUB YOUR EYES EVER I still have undereye luggage. :( /v This is like backstage making film quality... wow /v I love your spat with the makeup wipes XD /v So jealous of your life ! /v Loving the insta-stories and vlogs.The claw crampy hand thing might be from using a bigger camera more. I'm a photographer and my hands constantly do that with cramp after a long day. /v I'm loving the videos Claire! You are awesome! Have you done a video before about how you got started in your industry, like how you went from thinking of it to what you do now? I think that would be a really fun story!!  keep rockin' /v What's your face cotton pad of choice? /v I love that you're always open about what brands you wear ort in this case HOW this beautiful messy bun works!  \nso many youtubers are so secretive about these things, like they don't grant other people the knowledge or something. /v Haaaaay. So I do a similar hairstyle all the time but it's a bit simpler and much faster. If you've ever seen an inside out ponytail, you basically do that but pull it through from bottom to top instead of the other way around  Loving Vlogtember  /v Feel better Claire! You'll rest sooon This hard work of yours is definitely paying off! I hope you can squeeze some timee to come to Jenn Im's and Innisfree tomorrow!! *fingers crossed* /v Doing #theclaw while putting make up on is a lifestyle. First finger guns, now the claw shirt please! I'd totally buy it lol /v The sweet and salty kettle corn-style pop chips are WAY better. For future ref  /v Does anybody know what kind of iPhone case Claire has? :-) /v 7:17 I'm rather wondering why the hand is not kept busy taking  the make-up off the other eye. Two hands - two eyes - seems to be a perfect match. /v I'm sitting here in the bathtub literally laughing out loud at you trying to take the makeup wipe out! /v The makeup wipe struggle had me laughing out loud! :D :D /v Yes!!!

It's amazing! /v Thanks so much for sharing the trip even though you're crazy busy. We really appreciate it. /v Which fenty foundation are you! /v lol i do the t-rex hand too!! /v My only complaint/concern is that the hairstylist put the hair pins in her mouth. *gross* /v oh my god i want my hair to grow so bad now so i can do that hairstyle everyday.... /v When Claire grabs a snack, you grab a snack /v Omg I do the T Rex claw when taking of my makeup too  /v I could not stop laughing at you trying to remove the makeup wipe from the container.

One of their best video from my perspective do you agree guys ? /v Always a favorite of mine, I love this song. /v I would've raged and taken the stairs. /v This sucks ! High and Dry is better than this one.... /v what kinda jacket is that? anyone know? /v Thom's lift is in a building designed by Kafka. /v The 'lift' is probably a metaphor of life. \nLike the people we come across in our lives, each heading to their own destinations. Each of them sharing moments with us, however temporary it may seem. Some people (like the old man who misses the lift) could have been have a part of our lives, if time wanted them to be so, or sometimes we neglect the chance to let them in. \n\nWonderful video! /v teacher of the indie rock /v Are there any radiohead fans from India here? /v That ending got me so good /v One Russian famous band already did it in 2001, guys >< https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkjupxFCe4 /v not gonna lie I never liked radiohead /v I loveee radiohead /v He's daydreaming that a paranoid android has their knives out killing weird fishes. The karma police are now burning the witch while a creep is hunting bears. The man of war was a talk show host. No surprises. A lotus flower grew in a field with permanent daylight and fake plastic trees. The killing cars sail to the moon as a wolf at the door sends the daily mail. Dollar and cents, that is how I made millions. /v I paused porn to watch this /v But the elevator is not worthy /v Pretty relieved they went with the original arrangement and didn't try some  bullshit of reworking it in to another downtempo synth driven piece. /v Thx for the visit i guess.. /v 1:40 I think those bald men should be taking about the yuppies networking from paranoid android or even a reference from fake plastic trees shaving a bald head /v I haven't started listening to the song yet but the 100/1 ratio of likes and unlikes has made my hopes really high for this song. /v A man doomed to ride an elevator that stops on every floor; only to reach the ground floor and have to start over again.. for all eternity. 2017 horror film of the year: Lift. /v Not so strange that no one has a clue, but mysterious enough to keep us coming back for more. /v 1:39 people of kendrick's humble mv /v The ting with Radiohead, is that it gets directly to your soul, even if you didn't have one to begin with. /v 4:3 is the new black & white? /v I think that the video is stronger than the song and would work on its own better especially by adding dialogue, but they wouldn't ever let us do that. I guess it's an old song so the video is the point. /v wow, they still got it. I'll leave my favorite radiohead song here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG-eyxkGPf8 /v This is just raw footage of Thom's daily routine what the hell /v Ha ha drinking goldfish water, i did that once /v Thom's like Great. Now my ice cream is gonna melt... /v I love you Thom /v This video is a tribute to the lives lost September 11, 2001 and all the brave men and women who died of illness years after participating in the rescue and recovery effort.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zz11ZTB9Mdg\n\n#Don't forget 9/11\n\n#Radiohead FAN /v  ,   ,  ,    ^_^      . /v , ,   ,              . -      /v Plagiarism of video     .

They somehow managed to make a ride in the lift MORE boring. /v people who hate radiohead are very dumb and stupid FACT /v Roses are Red. Violets are Blue, Thom Yorke being on an elevator is more interesting than you. /v Best notification I've recieved in the entire day. <3 /v These OK Computer B sides have got me listening to Airbag/How Am I Driving?

It's a shoutout to their roots the way only they can make music, and it incorporates a modern feeling with an appreciation of both pop and non pop sounds. /v      .  ...\n, !\nthe British no longer have their brains. plagiarism is engaged ...\nfuuu, how uncultured!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfnKsyxE6q8 /v    /v Demi idol, you slay!!!!  /v They are disrespectful for lowering my queen's mic. But we know she would've outsang them anyway... /v They really muted my sis.... catch these hands!!! /v Demi Lovato, best vocal new generation.  /v Demi freaking Lovato /v go\nWHY THE FUCK DID THEY HAVE HER MIC SO DAM LOW. IDGAF IF SHE CAN OUTPOWER THEM. THOSE RUNS AT 3:11 WERE MAKIN MY TITS SECRETE SWEAT. Reminded me of the Make a Wave notes back from Disney. Jesus , 2017+2018, she coming for that dam Grammy and snatchin our wigs, weaves, and natural hair off ya head /v 3:08 OMG DEMETRIA TAKE ME TO CHURCH GIRL!!!!!!!!! /v Someone hand her a grammy /v Come on men, we all know the reason why they've turn lower the Mic of our beloved Queen Demi, at 3:10, it's was the best part in this music video, they know she already out slay them all ...that's why they couldn't take it no more with her sweet Stone soul voice, from in Disney Demi have soul music inside her, ever since birth I love the video, but I didn't like the part on 3:10 wen her voice was really amazing, and someone had to just ruin it, hope they never do that again in her upcoming new video... please don't... /v WHAT THE FUCK WITH HER MIC /v Why did they muted Demis mic??? /v this is a great example of what not to do as an audio engineer. this could have been unbelievably amazing, instead it was just cool to see them all on stage together. Now i want to hear a song with just Demi and Darius /v Okay, Demi has a powerful voice, so they dared to turn her mic down. BUT Cece also has a powerful voice, but her mic is fine. I mean you could even hear the backups singers better than Demi. /v Don't ask Demi to sing on a collab & then mute her fucking mic, her talent & voice deserve better. This is the sole reason why I HATE when she performs with other people. /v Thanks Demi for doing this for this event.  Love your look, and your generosity.  Brad Paisley was great too! /v Wow... demi... wow. /v Legend Lovato  /v Why the Hell Demi was almost muted?? /v Epic /v I'm a fan and I really love u Demi since her demo album. But, ,I have to say that her voice is not clean to me anymore. :/ /v A Demi arrasou   /v 3:11 AFTERSHOCK? HOLY CRAP /v Wow! Realmente espectacular  /v ....cant believe she sang today /v AMAZING /v They muted her mic cause the industry is dam aware Demi makes people her backup singers in collabs. Her voice is like the Eye of the Hurricane vs a sand tornado; Eat a dick sound people /v It's incredibly ironic that Demi Lovatos lines were about singing off key because her shrieking at the beginning was incredibly sharp... Cece Winans had to go and show them all... sad. /v Demi has never had the blended type voice so I understand lowering her a little because her voice is so powerful but this was way too quiet /v These other singers showed her up tbh. Her solo was painful. They turned her down toooo low though. Like wtf?? She is shouty but you couldn't hear aaaaanything! /v Love this. I felt cece was very very loud and that you could barely hear demi. They all are great though /v this cover was straight up wack, congrats to them for playing and singing but nah this wasn't fun to listen to /v They should release this song and have all proceeds benefit those affected by the hurricanes. /v Good, but it's not Joe Cocker good....when he did it (RIP) it brought tears to the eyes. /v O my god Demi is terrible /v The whole time watching this I was thinking why are the backup singers getting like 50 times more screen time than the actual celebrities?? /v What's going on with Demi's mic???????? /v My day is ruined /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v Lovato's mic is too low.  Can't hear the full potential of her powerful voice.  Darn... /v WHY IS THIS ON TRENDING?!\nThe /v It was all in all..congratulation /v Joe cocker's version is effortlessly better. /v yes they had to lower her mic because she was practically swallowing it. /v Demi you betta sing girl!!! Take me to heaven baby girl /v Catherine Jenner is back vocal? I really didn't know  /v this is bullshit, i can hardly hear demi /v this reminds me of last year's HEAVEN HELP US ALL performance /v This is disgraceful /v Butt chin sings country? /v A Demi arrasou  /v I do not stop to replay.. /v AAAAAA, RAINHA /v CeCe!!! <3 /v CeCe was SANGING! /v Oh shiiiit Demiiiio /v damn demi u go girl /v tres bien inspir par JOE .. /v such a throaty performance of Demi. Didn't like it at all. That G5 in the end made up for it. Thankfully her mic was muted. /v Why does there need to be a country version of this song...its not even special sounding anymore! /v Does Demi not understand that you have to have dynamic, its so unnecessary to do all of that shouty throaty singing at the start of a song, so poorly executed, I've loved Demi for years, met her plenty of times and she literally has had a huge impact on my life, but these days she's become a bit of a vocal show off like Christina Aguilera...think about when Christina did 'Say Something' it was so much more impactful because for once she wasn't screaming. idk someone has to get me here. /v They couldn't do auto tune for her - so they subtlety turned down her volume. That why she should stick to auto tune. /v Cece Winans took it easy on them, 'cause if she let loose, it would've been a wrap /v The thought that kept wandering in my head was If this girl fucks this song up bruh....I swear LOL! But she didn't, and she had some kind of restraint. But that may have been due to mic issues. If so, it saved the song, 'cause it prohibited her from doing the most as she usually does xD /v I have no idea why they muted Demi's mic she is better then all of them there she has the most powerful voice  /v This is fucking horrible.  What the fuck is wrong with these people? /v Shout out to the owner of this version, mr joe cocker. Rip /v I feel bad saying this, I love Demi since Camp Rock but lately ever since her and Wilmer split she changed so much. She even annoys me now. /v Meanwhile in Syria US busy bombing civilians /v It's ok. It's only Cubans. No big deal. /v almost my whole family lives in cuba i pray for them\n\n1 like = ok im not even going to do it /v 10 is not a lot of people. /v noone can seriously think this wouldnt happen lol. throw a large storm into an area with shacks and dirt poor people. tis life /v 10 is actually a good number, considering it was the strongest storm to ever hit Cuba. And let she honest, Cuba isn't exactly a country of incredible infrastructure and solid buildings. So the death toll could have been astronomical. /v What, I can't hear you. I was attacked by sonic weaponry...... sorry, good luck. /v It didn't happen in america so we don't really care. /v Please show that people died in that video /v Cool just give me my edge points already /v Maybe they should get rid of the whole dictator prob /v Only 10 people dead? That's not too bad. It's sad for everyone who has to start over in life. Because I know that can be frustrating and emotional. But I was expecting like hundreds of people to die /v God bless the ones who suffer please believe and love him 1 pray one bless to someone in\nwho's suffering /v My best friend is Cuban  /v The thumbnail of the woman crying hurts me. /v T-t-t-ten? Holy cow, that's like me plus 9 other people. /v Mexico had over 90+ dead, but you don't see that on the trending page...... /v watch my hurricane after math video /v Thousands of people die in plane crash, news is silent. 10 people die, 3rd on trending /v Why did this video blow up? /v Far-left journalists before Irma = Cuba has the best protocol to protect their citizens, they will have no casualties\nAfter Irma = . . . . . . . . . . /v Katrina killed 1000+ /v There all dead......AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!! /v havana ooh nana /v LOVE ONE ANOTHER\nPEACE, LOVE, UNITY, PROSPERITY, CALM, WISDOM, FORGIVE, RESPECT, HONESTY, TOLERANCE, \nGOOD HEALTH, LIBERTY, CLEAN ENERGY, SELF CONTROL, EQUALITY, INCLUSION, PARDON, PATIENCE, JOY, STAY SAFE, WELL-BEING, KINDNESS /v That's it ? 10? /v Prayers are useless /v That's Gucci /v I see /v fly high  /v No ... not again /v Will trump care? /v hurricane earma /v Ear-mah /v  /v Oh no ten people /v wartur /v  /v 10? More like fidget spinners!!!! /v Aljazeera is like Isis. /v I can't believe people are actually complaining that it was 10 people. 10 people could have been your loved ones or even you. They are brothers, sisters, mothers, aunts, uncles to someone. If you have nothing positive to say. Leave. /v just 10? God dammit....step it up nature. at this rate it'll take thousands of years for the humans to go extinct.  gotta upgrade the hurricanes. /v God hates Communism /v Best of luck to Cuba. As a south Floridian, I've experienced wilma and now Irma. Both felt identical in damages. Depressing aftermath for both storms but blessed that both were far from catastrophic. Irma was a storm that only hit the Caribbean hard. I can only imagine how bad it is in Cuba right now. Sending my condolences to the lives lost. /v People's believe in God of Sun ..and God of Sunday ... thats name of that God is Nemrod and he is in charge to help you :-(  if you pray to him...he will make to you more and more destruction...Pray to really God ,God of Abraham Isaac and Jakob ..and you can be safe .. /v I can't take this comment section people are literally saying lol /v Not in the Subject but..\n\n\n\n\n\nWas that Jacob Satrorius in the Thumbnail /v They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep /v its so sad that many people have never experienced how cubans live . i, myself am cuban . i was born there but moved to america. many people dont understand that simple evacuation is hard . and with trump not letting cubans enter america easily is much worse . and for the people saying 10 is nothing . its A LOT. most cubans are often acquainted with many people and everyone is very caring for everyone else and people are very close. So 10 is a lot even though it seems like nothing here ,its a lot for Cubans. And in regards that Cubans barely have any health , medicine or basic living supplies most Cubans die of diabetes and many other diseases and its very sad. /v I thought it was 39 in Cuba... /v It broke concrete buildings, prayers to Cuba! /v How's there's only like 4 people left in cuba /v In Mexico 1000 people died because of the earthquake and no one is talking about it... /v Stay Strong People, whatever it is please stay strong for God and your loved ones he blessed you with /v Dominican Republic was spared!! /v  watch by clicking on icon people's are entertaining you really enjoy /v 10 ppl dead in cuba  NUMBERS DONT ADD UP LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE TBH /v That's it only 10 I'm disappointed in this Hurricane should have killed more. /v The boy at 00:8 is fine asf /v Lol /v sure it wasnt just cartel? /v Today two of chickens were attack by a coyote\n\nI would like to say I loved them \n\nThis had to happen right when they were starting to lay eggs /v Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart /v Youtube, put the Middle East sufferers on trending. /v Only 10 calm down jeez /v So sad  they are in my prayers  /v This is so sad my prayers go out to everyone affected by Irma  /v Very saddened by this. Thoughts and prayers /v Only ten? Sad. Get more next time. /v Why can't they drink the water  /v Cuba has 10 people die, Mexico has more, America has more, the Caribbean has more. But let's cover poor cuba /v God bless all of us and the other hurricane victims. /v Is popular moms ok ?? /v How do you evacuate Cuba? They won't let them off the island. /v 10??......There's prolly 50 murders a day in Cuba but still sad /v God bless them /v But ma Socialism. /v Who cares about third-world countries? Lol /v cuban government is probably smiling..... /v Lol just 10. /v Sub to me if this is terrible /v ... /v Cuba has a population of eleven million people. I doubt it matters if they lose 10 /v How do so few people die? Like OMG that's still decent. 1800 died in New Orleans in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina. /v Cuba's president nice joke /v and how many died from smoking since then? /v Buildings must be extremely week. Very few concrete buildings in the other islands hit by Irma had their walls come down /v Every one let's help the best we can it's time to make a change!! /v Here it's the real part Cuba get 50% european and 30% Canadian tourist. Not Americans alow in Cuba but yea America it's the only country the world expect to give aid and food to Cuba. How ironic.. /v People die all the time...100 died in car wrecks yesterday... I'm dying rite no....w.... /v 10 really /v weather modification solar radiation management geoengineering. /v  /v Spllitz he wouldnt care /v Hurbicanes beez raythith an sheeeit /v Que tristesa  pero Cuba es un pais de gente muy trabajadora y que sabe lebantarse ante estas situaciones  /v Haarp /v I don't feel sad oh well /v Only 10, that's not bad at all /v Hurricane earma /v Tori Kelly will never disappoint me.   she's so talented! /v They should consider a duet in the future, this is just beautiful!! /v Tori is so perfect  just saying  /v OH MY GOSH MY QUEEN SINGING MY FAVORITE SONG  love her so much /v I love toris voice raspy or not . She sounded emotional and btw her voice is raspy for those who dont know /v she slayed as usual\n(also lol i saw sofia vergara?) /v #43 trending  these two have beautiful voices! Can't wait for TK2  /v Tori Kelly went the fuck off at the end! Goosebumps. /v * BEAUTIFUL * For all the volunteers and donors , thank you. You can still donate and most importantly PRAY for everyone. May GOD bless all the victims and the world , in JESUS name ! /v Love this performance! Tori's raspiness was everything.

Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support. /v boeing have been developing an electric aircraft called the sugervolt /v The future of aviation is high speed rail. /v The plane of the future is a BOAT!  /v 2020: Flying planes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK I'll stop /v Check out this dji-mavic-pro-camera-drone-gpsglonass-4k camera-65kmh-fpv on BriskSale! https://brisksale.com/refer/59a5037fe3ed53245f8a854a /v whats the decision they regretted? did i miss it or am i just  stupid? /v 3:34 Since when does a Dreamliner carry 359 passengers?? /v Why not just start building the 757 jet design again,  but this time with better more-efficient engines and better avionics.  Sounds like a winning move to me. /v You grew fast af I could have sworn you had 50,000 subs when I last saw /v Could have a plane that goes to 60k feet up and breaks the sound barrier. Make it hit 1,000mph cut the time in half. The higher the plane the thinner the air the faster you can go. /v Pilotless plane? Yeah that's what we all want.  A plane with no pilots.  Great idea.  Those guys are useless.  \n\nFucking morons. /v So did people not watch the entire video or what? He literally speaks about these planes and your commenting like he didn't mention them and why they wouldn't work ! *Watch the whole video before you comment !!* /v If the 757 had fit perfectly in the spot for now, why not make a 757 Max??? /v With the 797, Boeing runs out of numbers.  What will be their next model? /v They could just bring the same plane back...\nAirbus will never work on smaller projects when bigger ones are available to take on.\nBoeing will never work on a big project as both times they said they would, they backed down saying it was impossible. They wouldn't want to risk it unless they can guarantee a success since it would look really bad on them to give up a third time. /v I just want a plane that stops ear discomfort /v Actually no train beats the plane in any US market /v Age isnt an issue, airplanes are inspected at a minimum of once a year and if there is any problem the plane is stripped down until the issue is found. Most single engine aircraft are 45+ years old. These planes are still safe. Age isnt an issue and as long as they make enough profit to not make that initial cost of buying a new plane, then nothing will or needs to change. Honestly its like channels like this and vox are trying to terrify its viewers /v If the near-term prediction is correct, it sounds like more direct flights and fewer connections to catch, especially for people flying to/from smaller cities. Meaning, perhaps, that airports currently relying on their major-airline hub status might start to lose traffic? /v I thought 767 is smaller than 787 /v I wish Lockheed (Martin) would make aircraft again. The TriStar is such an unsung aircraft that put ones like the DC-10 (and other tri jets) to shame in comfort and safety. /v Future travel will consist of evacuated tube travel the time the plane is almost over . all hail the hyper loop /v The phrase Planes of future  has two problems. One - they will be electric, two - may be nobody will fancy air route as it is inefficient.. Will be replaced by private small flying cars for short distances and hyperloop like techs for longer distances /v Delta has custom built their seats in planes for comfort and entertainment /v This is so depressing, what ever happened to the need for speed ? All this push for more efficiency but the speed remains a sluggish Mach 0.85 when millions traveled across the Atlantic at supersonic speeds just a few decade ago. The push for a new supersonic commercial aircraft needs to happen sure the fuel costs will be higher per flight but the frequency of flights and the absence for the need for lavish comforts will offset that. To think people thought we all be flying supersonic in the 2000s oh how things turned out... /v Here's an idea...\n\nStop cramming the seats so close together that my knees are in my damn chest you fuckers! /v Wouldn't electric trains just undercut airplanes for short range in price? I guess to understand that you'd have to understand how trains are profitable. I think that you can't sell the idea that short haul flight saves time over trains when you have to spend more time at the airport just to get on the plane with security checkpoints, boarding 45 minutes before flight, and maybe not so much taxing but it's still a factor. Trains don't have to deal with these things to get from point A to point B. Especially in your example of NY to DC (and that's about the only short haul route in the US where that works because Amtrak at least owns the Northeast Corridor track). In other areas where Amtrak pays for the usage of track on a freight line a short haul flight may be faster. /v We are almost at 2020 and flights are still 12 hours US to Europe. I think its time to make that the priority along efficiency. /v But how about the 767? /v Airbus actually has an answer A321++. It will be a re-wing stretch out A321. Some call it A322 the wing will be composite and it will stand taller to fit a larger more efficient engine. This plane will be the true 757 replacement since 797 is slightly larger and more comparable to 767. /v Here is an idea, how about make a smaller plane and cram even more people in to it:) /v Why tf is every video on here about airplanes /v As an aspiring pilot flights as cheap as bus rides are the absolute last thing i want /v Whats the need for another Boeing aircraft? The current ones get the job done very well. Aging doesnt really matter in this case. /v Jesus your pro Boeing. Airbus totally rules and so push us forward more... /v When is the nuclear power air plain is coming ? /v why assume planes are the future considering how crowded the skies are getting?  bullet train infrastructure will remove 60% of air flights by the year of 2045 /v the hyperloop is a joke. /v Do you have a video on best time to book a flight or best days @wendover /v I love the 757, I hope Boeing brings back a modernized one /v @ 3:33,  you say the range of the 757 is 4,000 nautical miles. 4,000 nautical miles = 7408 km; 1 nautical mile = 1.15 miles /v I expect to eventually see some hybrid/fully electric aircraft developed to manage the majority of short range and economy flights and a return of supersonic aircraft absorbing much of the long distance and business demand /v 4000 nautical miles are 7408 km, aren't they? /v I'm pretty sure it cost more to get to Edinburgh from London by train then plane atm, also takes way longer /v Planes of the future will be Muslim proof /v I think that the 757 should comeback, it had few accidents compared to the 737, the Dreamliner is to young to be have anywhere near the amount of say the 747. The 757 had the range, capability and can be extended to fit the needs, the new variant of the 757 would be the 757-300 or 757-200LF (Longer Fuselage) /v I unsubscribe due to your Boeing fan boying. I thought this was an un bias channel. /v look as car are going hybrid now days (most super cars now) when will we get a hybrid plane were i guess soler power + fuel for back up fuel something like that :P /v The train being cheaper than air travel is not really correct at all. Osaka-Tokyo for instance is almost always cheaper to fly than ride a train (especially shinkansen), with buses being the most inexpensive. /v I love airplanes.....but I like trains more. Sorry. /v Lot of Airbus fanboys I this comments section today... /v Soon, I can fly from Detroit to Warsaw... Also what will the next plane after the 797 be? 807? /v If it's not Boeing, I'm not going! /v Boeing is a bully. Picking on a small manufacturer like Bombardier. /v Oil has been supposed to double in price in the next twenty years for the past fifty years, and yet gas is cheaper now than it was fifteen years ago. /v The next plane of the future will be an alien space craft LoL /v ???? there will never be an electric long range or even short  range aircraft.. youre silly..\n2ndly.. the 737 has been manufactured 30 years.. the 757 will be upgraded to a 757 long range before a 797 is ever produced.. /v Y'all need t start taking notes from soul plane we need airplanes like that /v Bull Shit video. i don't give a fuck about price just get me from point A to point B in no time like concord. stop wasting our time posting these crap videos jesus /v I miss not seeing 747's in the sky anymore. /v I'm just flew from Edinburgh to London Gatwick 45 minutes. In your video you say is 79 minutes to Heathrow which is closer than Gatwick.  Turboprop flight is much longer on this route /v I actually flew on a 757 from LA to Kona Hawaii, as well as from Honolulu to Pheonix just a few months back. Very interesting video! /v This is why I subscribed to you, you do amazing work! /v It would be cool so see the A310 being produced again :D HOpefully the time for the a340 will come back too :/ (a340 \o/)  In fact, airbus has some cool updates with their neo concept. I think, that the A321Neo will fill up the 757 gap with the a330neo.  But i think, for getting such an Video, i should ask another youtuber because you seem to be paid by Boeing. \nAs far as i now:\nB737 vs. A320-Family\nB767 vs. A330\nB777 vs. A340 (A340 not to be build anymore)\nB787 vs. A350\nB747 and A380 are the queen and the king of the sky, they don't fight each other^^\nDid i get everything right? /v But lithium polymer bat are not as dense energy as carbon fuels. It's like having flying as is now, but you need twice the fuel tanks. Maybe some efficiency gain in electric motor compared to gas turbine. /v The day that Spokane gets an international flight is the day pigs fly /v I don't think that short haul flights are really worth it. A 2 hour wait in the airport, getting through security etc, for a 40 min flight isn't worth it. I'd rather just sleep on a train for a few hours. /v stop it! please no more planes! /v Airbus A322? What, just throwing some potential in there.\n[EDIT] It could be electric. /v Why did you ignore the Brazilian, Canadian, Chinese, and Russian manufacturers? They're all become influential quickly. /v I hope you're getting paid by the airlines, boeing or other for all of this research, analysis, etc /v More Aviation vids please, love these. /v Just to let you know Wendover, I didn't understand a ding (damn thing). /v Here in Seattle, I see this huge plane huuuge it's called the sky whale, it's abtriple decker with 2 rows and 2 seats in each row. I thought it was pretty cool, I see then flying around everyone once n a while. /v 787 relatively small? Nah man stand close to that shit man /v YES MORE PLANE GOODNESS /v hey im from spokane!! /v What about the A321neoLR ... /v Edimbruh /v Channel sponsored by Boeing /v Aurora? /v Ttttrending /v Ops.....A380????? I love a380 /v Tesla will take over. /v PEAK EFFICIENCY /v Concord was. /v I heard United is removing carpeting from aisles so it will be easier to drag out customers. /v Am I the only one who thought this was going to be a Family Guy clip? /v 8:10 RIP Landing Gear /v Airbus?????????????? /v go plash crane into house /v Yeah United breaks guitars  /v Hyperloop /v Somebody likes planes. /v Check out Sept 23 revelation on YouTube. /v welcome back to planes /v The fucking aircraft can reach max speed if it were to except they choose not to because it's more fuel efficient. /v Electric ...facepalm. There is a reason people don't use electric aircraft. Very, very poor energy per kg means the payload would be increased to the point of insanity. The entire point is to reduce the costs of fuel, electricity still costs money and still produces CO2, usually more cost and CO2 than an efficient combustion or jet engine for that matter. Then the idea of flying with the majority of the aircraft full of huge lithium batteries is, uh, a little dangerous. Currently we already get a reasonable number of lithium battery issues - a small battery setting on fire and burning up. If the aircraft is not only full of massive numbers of lithium batteries but the batteries are forced to be as efficient as possible rather than a big heavy and safe/reliable battery (often lead acid rather than lithium) then we can expect a dramatically increased rate of accidents. Then the biggest danger in aircraft crashes currently is the fuel leaks and fires. With lithium batteries' near certainty to set alight, incredibly high temperature, very rapid reaction, and huge difficulty in putting the fire out we would certainly see a large increase in deaths. And finally electric engines are incredibly poor and inefficient in transonic flight. A slower flight means not only fewer passengers but more aircraft needed to shift the same amount of passengers and thus higher fuel and maintenance costs. In short the concept of electric aircraft to replace anything from the small under-100 seat regional aircraft to the large A380 super jumbos is simply a pipe dream. Electric cars are less efficient than hybrid cars for fuel and CO2 costs, an aircraft with its significant disadvantages beyond increased fuel efficiency... just no. /v And not a single word about Sukhoi or Antonov planes. /v As someone who has seen you evolve throughout the years, I still have the same reactions as these teens((I'm 22). /v Mitch looks weird with a mustache /v I have a daughter that's a Junior in HS, and I know that the performing arts students respect the hell out of Pentatonix, and the same for the creative gonna do this my way, but you can be you and I respect that are inspired by them too.  Also they just love Superfruit...so these teens reacted in a way that seemed like what I hear around my house from the teenage horde  /v Now these two, now THESE two, o, forget it, why even comment, the picture describes it best. /v but like, it's not friday /v Seriously Mitch.

I'm sorry /v white women going extinct when white men invent the ai and the artificial wombs deus vult white men already invented a robot that cooks a full meal coming out in 2018 artificial wombs soon will be out \n4-5 years (lets hope) ai females that can talk and have secs alrdy out today and will be more realistic each year / month ..... think about it why do we suffer for white women they only ruin our rep and our white might to virtue signal to the leftist elite and the monky negros\ntech will save the white man /v This makes me want to die 20% more then before and im already at 75% /v Homo central! /v Fag /v Pedophile head ass /v most faghot-ass thumbnail /v Fags! /v How awful. /v What the hell is this...I feel like I woke up from coma and I'm feel kind of lost...what the hell is this channel/video? Is this for real? /v Am i the only one who waiting for the weekly obsessions and song of the week at the end of the video????? /v Okay so of course I felt like shit when this came out unplanned and it was because my day leading up to it was shit. So in chemistry we had to sit through a carbon video having to do with elements WHY I DONT KNOW but that's why school is pointless and you feel dumb every fucking day and all the time if you do something wrong. And then my second period I already wasn't in the mood to be there cause I felt like shit from the class before and I'm love lonely so then this guy's all talking about this mattress fundraiser and when class was over I'm all briefly saying hi and then the teacher comes over and he's all You're gonna be late you can't talk to __________ everyday. You're being nice to people which is fine but (get the fuck out) was what he was trying to tell me so then I'm all pissed because it's like Um bitch do you not get in suicidal and this is the only way I'm not suffering from child abuse? The only reason why I can't do cheer, or why I can't be in choir next semester or why I can't be happy or why I can't be in react and show my good to the world is because the abuse I'm getting is suppressing me enough to where I'm gonna commit suicide if I'm forced out of choir all because I'm being me and my abusers aren't ready for me to be myself which is stupid because they're jeopardizing my health and I want them to go to Prision and I'm boarder line gonna fuck them up and I don't want them in my life and to me Johnny the music teacher sounded like a shitty parent. Like there's a reason why I shut down and can't trust him I don't wanna cause attention to myself by saying that my brother molested me because I don't think he'll ever believe me and I don't think he ever cared about me and that he only called me Jerid all because he didn't want to lose his job. A lot of me too feels like he never did like me and always thought I was annoying as fuck and that I couldn't do shit right and I don't talk to him about it because I can't trust him and I can't trust him because of my brother. Like I do wanna have trust in a person of them saying We're not just gonna give up if they don't accept you but my life will never be the same again and my life will always be tourcher cause of that and they've only tried to offer counciling but I've always turned it down cause I've lived this far without them I can handle it I'm a big boy but they're only gonna offer it so I don't commit suicide and then they end up getting sued from parent to school but then if I did die then I'd be blamed for everything, blamed for dieing blamed for being transgender in the first place, blamed for being gay like I'm not gonna take it I deserve better and there's only so much I can take but I'm tired of the same people not calling me Jerid and all that but all my dad does is beat me and he tells me Jared Folgel comments and subway sandwhich comments and comments of you're weird stop being it, just today he goes Don't be the weird kid meaning I can't see you as a son and you're an embarrassment and I'm scared for you when really he doesn't wanna admit he's a fucking pussy and not handling me like a real man should cause he doesn't say I love you. He never taught me about boys he's made me ashamed of me he's made me think everything I do is wrong and I've stopped being on twitter because I wanna be myself. Like to me that's not a real father that's a pussy ass man that needs real fucking boxers and actually pay attention to me for once in his life. And will I ever tell Johnny any of this shit FUCK NO.... I can't trust his ass one second to even think he can fix anything like my god. So you can assume what happens next after this. There's this girl that knows the birthname but she's too much of a fucking pussy to go into deep water and god I wanted to start a fight with her so bad one time cause she cant stop bitching and it reminds me of too much of Rita so why the fuck would I ever be around her? So I end up on this court with her and she ends up telling me Hey go play like on my partner's court, so then I'm like \nNo. And then she eventually goes I'm gonna tell. And then I'm all You're gonna snitch? She goes Yeh like all bitches do. And I'm all Cause that's all you ever were? And before all that I'm like saying a fuck bomb or something I don't remember what it was, and then before she could complain about me I'm already on my game saying \nI'm not playing well whenever she's on the court with me and she's not nice to me. And she damn well knows I'm a boy and uses she and I'm like She's not even using my pronouns and so then the teacher was asking what I wanted to do and I said that I didn't want to at least be on her court so then a friend comes by and goes to play with me for the rest of class and it was cute I liked it. And then I was thinking to myself after all this Hey I wonder if Superfruit is gonna come on today I wonder so then in the middle of class and there being a sub I end up crying in class because I felt like everything was better and I didn't have to be all nuts anymore. Mitch made me okay. It was like I ended up having a drug that I went cold turkey on and then felt better. And then after that was lunch and math and after that is a teacher I hate so then I'm all wanting to go switch out teachers but I filled a request days ago so like I highly doubt that it went in already but yeh. /v Gay /v It may not look that bad in Florida but the Caribbean islands are the ones that got hit the most /v What a lot of people don't realize is that even though it didn't completely obliterate Florida, there are many of the islands like the Bahamas and various other places that will never ever be the same again. This storm was a monster, but we're only focused on what it did to one place and not the rest. /v Boohoo shpw the Caribbean. It's gone. Not all this happy white suburban homes without roofs. People in st marteen don't have roofs anymore either... OR HOMES /v So where are the fly overs of Bermuda? /v Thanks for the video. People need to see this \nMore South Florida aftermath here as well --\nhttps://youtu.be/_qIB4_kgd_w /v USA today trying to justify their fear mongering by cherry picking.  We all know what you're you to media.  Just don't /v Really vast and severe equals roof still on a trailer home. This pales in comparison to real hurricane damage. I mean trailers homes are still on the ground and not in their neighbors yard! /v Why are they only showing mobile homes?\nAren't they less likely to go through a big storm like this? /v This isnt bad at all... if you wanna see bad then look at the Caribbean islands where it looks like Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. /v From the air USA Today posts fake news. /v That was not shit /v this has to be the most clickbait fraudulent claim of destruction I've ever seen. small tornadoes will do 10x the amount of damage this did. who's agenda are you fulfilling usa today??? /v It's not that bad /v Hi! Check out my channel for tv reviews and recommendations. Thanks :D /v Nice depressing music to accompany the damage.  \n\nWeather is the only way the news can stay relevant anymore. /v I am so sick of people saying not that bad,not everyone is rich or can afford to rebuild. /v Try to use appropriate adjectives to describe events rather than over exaggerating to get views like a below average YouTube editor.... /v It wasn't that bad in parts of Florida ,but it hit the Carribean horribly /v a horrible attempt to try and get us to freak out /v You know, spotlight should be shown where the hurricane was actually catastrophic: down in the Island Nations. Place where there is no more infrastructure anymore. Where people can't find food anymore because of the hurricane. Not where someone's boat is half sunken or a roof was torn off and that's it. /v So some trailers were missing some roofs and that's it? Wheres the flattened buildings or flooded city streets? /v I don't see how you can call it not bad when millions of people are without power and they are not going to have food or gasoline for a long time without having to resort to emergency support. Many of the homes are not going to be able to be rebuilt for years if at all and the property will be sold to the highest bidder and they will not rent to these people who are not able to live in their homes now. Supplies go to the richest people who can afford to rebuild and or live somewhere else while they are waiting for their homes. They are going to be waiting for insurance for homes, cars and boats. They are not going to be working for quite a while now. They are not going to be ok in a week. Many have no air conditioning now in the heat. This was not a weak . There are sick, elderly and disabled people trying to manage right now and figure out how to get by with the devestation. Weak , I don't think so /v Wouldn't call this catastrophic /v All those Mullets.  Oh the horror.  The horror. /v Trailer park videos! Really? That's normal. /v Lool. If you call this bad then that's nothing. Seriously these look right next to the ocean too. Trailer park looked decent. Did you plan the before and after, common? You can't call this catastrophic /v They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep /v *BUT DID IT DESTROY A GAMING CHAIR* /v this is one of the worst videos I've ever seen /v why is it all mobile homes on cement slabs and tin roof panel houses? of course these types of structures would break easy. /v Lol!!! A few cardboard box houses were blown away.... devastating /v First off. This was sad in comparison to Andrew. Second, WHO FILMS DRONE SHOTS IN 1x1?! It looks terrible. /v They gassed this hurricane up like it was bouta be the end of florida. The News Hyping it up like florida wasnt going to be on the map anymore /v lmfao at anyone who thought this was actually gonna devastate anything. Florida experiences hurricanes quite frequently. As a result, most houses are built to last through a hurricane of substantial power. The media definitely overplayed this one lol /v Has everyone forgot bout hurricane Harvey victims and are worried bout just Florida....? /v Catastrophic? Sit down. /v We don't care about mobile homes. Show us more of regular houses, that's what's interesting because everyone knows a mobile home can't hold up to a hurricane. /v Remember to pay your climate change dues so this shit won't happen anymore. /v When you get click-baited by the news  /v bahahaha what's with all that saturation with before irma show us the real pics and don't make it too exaggerated yeesh /v Its nit that bad from what i see /v It was a CAT 3 at landfall and quickly weakened soon after made worse only by the fact that many a moron live in aluminum boxes. Are those things even anchored beyond electric & gas connectors? /v Looks like a trailer park in texas after a small tornado. /v Had to stop it 5 seconds in because of the music. Fail /v Stop making houses out of cardboard /v We will rebuild we always do...LOVE TEXAS & FLORIDA  /v Never thought people would argue over who's city got destroyed the most. /v OH MY GOD!!! THE WORST STORM EVER SLIGHTLY DAMAGED SOME PROPERTIES! CALL FEMA! \n\nWhat is Florida's death toll again? /v Hurricane Andrew literally flattened entire suburbs. This is far far from a catastrophe. /v It really wasn't as bad as it could be. /v And the wolf went to the fourth little pig, who made his mobile home out of cheap materials and paper mache ....... /v Irma kicked the shit out of those trailer parks. /v It's almost like Andrew. /v For a category 3 hurricane it's pretty okay /v Lmfao people are disappointed that is wasn't worse wtf is wrong with you people /v media trying to stir up more fear /v Make your houses out of stone you will feel like nothing ever happened /v I don't believe it /v Trump is in trouble, he has to donate 2 million dollars now. He's going to be broke /v Woow! So much for catastrophic damages. Even the trailer parks are still standing!  /v Whats with the horrible music? tf /v Other then some property damage and laying tress, irma did nothing /v Thank you God that I did not get hit and my family in Florida is fine. God bless all the people that got hit. I wish the best for you /v  Thumbs up if you were expecting a creepy clown with this music.    /v Building codes in Florida should make structure more wind resistant. But to me it looks corners were cute. And i cant feel sorry for people live in mobil homes next to the shore in hurricane alley (Florida). Thats just stupid. /v Really f#ck these square video's. Smartphone manufacturers: Here's bigger screen with higher resolution than ever! Facebook: Here is a square compressed to death video! Enjoy!  /v THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.  COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE. /v Y'all acting like Irma didn't hit the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Smh. It did damage plenty and it may not have damaged Florida on a massive scale but thank goodness for that. /v Show the carribeans! That's real catastrophe! /v They hyped this storm up to be absolutely devastating when it hit Florida but it was no where near that...smh /v Meanwhile Barbuda got wiped off the planet .... /v I like how they're only covering Florida but not the Carribean that got fucked by the strongest hurricane to be ever formed in the Atlantic at its strongest point (190 MPH Winds and 225 MPH Gusts) that even caused places like Barbuda to be Inhabitable (meaning you're not allowed to live there anymore) which the entirety of that island got 95-100% destroyed. And the dozens that also died throughout there. They didn't even cover Puerto Rico, which the US owns. Like shit... /v Irma: It's over! I have the high ground! /v Why not just go to the islands that actually got hit with cat 5 winds /v This hurricane wasnt even as bad as Harvey tbh... Overhyped hurricane 2017 /v Oh, the humanity. /v Irma wasn't that bad.. /v Quit overhyping it. Andrew was worse. /v https://youtu.be/wJBBlntDtEU /v Overhyped /v THATS NOTHING, DENIED! /v lol nothing /v what overhyped bullshit /v Trump is a Cat 5 dumbass. /v gofundme.com/dragonmother /v Maybe its catastrophic because its a goddamn trailerpark /v Sarasota gets hit by Irma.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YedAWzqUxg&t=6s /v Harvey was 10 times worse /v My room looks worse /v skip ad\ni need a doughnut /v Nah.. Just a drizzle /v Irma was overhyped /v Follow my Vlog bad boy /v FAKE NEWS!! /v Nice clickbait /v http://www.eaymusic.com/forum.php?x=68155 /v Lol. /v This'll prove the Irma deniers wrong /v What the f ever, Harvey caused way worse deatruction... florida lost sum shingles and couple boats so fuckin what /v So a few shingles missing is devistation?  Then Harvey must have been apocoltptic. /v I don't consider this a celebrity makeup line. I consider it a legit makeup line that happened to be created by a celebrity. /v Omg what lashes is she wearing???  /v perfect foundation shade yasss /v Love your channel  /v Fenty Beauty looked gorgeous on you! /v The gloss....so good /v Girl you're trending /v When you're outside do you have a filter on your camera? /v I love the trending tab all makeup and celebs \n\n\n\nnot gaming or comedy /v I just ordered this foundation for myself from all the reviews of fenty beauty foundations this foundation looks like it was made just for me, the most perfect one. I'm so excited to receive it. /v Can you do a video of your favorite brushes for foundation, eyes etc? I'm trying to find a great foundation brush that doesn't leave texture/print on the skin after blending. Thanks! /v We are the same shades! Get 240 :) /v I just realized we use the same shade in Estee Lauder Double Wear! I knew it was Shell Beige but not the number of it. This is going to help me so much with your foundation reviews. I believe you're the only youtuber that matches me! Thanks girl! /v hello anybody want to fry some eggs I am so dead Amy!!! /v You should definitely buy the brushes their amazing! /v Like hello anyone wanna get some eggs  /v What's the brush you used to highlight? /v i love love ur review thank u for sharing with us  /v I also got shade 300 but i wanted a shade darker than myself (tanner), not too much that it looks weird though, anyways I feel like it looks a little orange on me so maybe I should go to 290 instead! On you it looks orange too I wouldn't say its darker so maybe we both should get shade 290! But I should say it is also the lighting where you filmed because when you were outside it looked just fine! \nps. I'm so happy I finally found someone who is the same shade as me haha :) /v Tbh I think this foundation is AMAZING !!! I personally love it cuz I have supper oily skin and it held up for me all day..I loveee how it looks on you. looks sooooo flawless <3 nice reviewoverall tho! would love to see a follow up with your shade /v The gloss looks too sticky... i've noticed that on so many other people's videos as well like you can see the stringy-ness when opening and pressing your lips together to speak. That's the only thing from this collection i wouldn't purchase just because of that /v you're like a whole other ethnicity now /v Maybe its drying dark because u added a second layer /v She does not even need makeup /v You look orange you need a way lighter color! /v You are sooo stunning Amy  /v her eyes... wow /v Your skin is flawless  /v Hey babe, You're Trending!! /v It looks good  /v 17:15 /v favorite review by far!  /v  /v Try 280 love! /v YESSSSS SISSSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR REVIEW!!!!!! /v  /v I like your vlog style check ins  /v Everything looks so stunning on you, you're making me want to put on a full face of Fenty Beauty again! /v what shade would you reccomand if your golden sand in the loral true match? /v So is the foundation worth it?

I need this foundation in my life. /v Is anybody an NC20 in Mac that can give me there shade in the fenty beauty foundation?? /v Idk if it's just me but it looks like the side you used Rihanna's sponge on, the foundation appeared a little lighter while the other side looked a little darker. But when you used the beauty blender on both sides, it looked good lol. The foundation looks great on you though. /v Your video is on the TRENDING PAGE!!!!  /v This looks like a great video, but after you are done would you be kind enough to check out my new YouTube channel and give me some feedback? Maybe even subscribing? ;) https://youtu.be/BhQob6WW-TQ /v Stunning like always ! Thank you for this really informative review ! /v How many times can one person say the word Smooth!!!!!! /v You're one of my favorite YouTubers  /v The filter you used at the end was crazy /v I just want to take this moment to tell you that you are so beautiful and articulate. I love how in depth you get on products. You're such a great YouTube. I love how down to earth and humble you are. Also your bare skin looks really good. /v Not usually a commenter however I noticed on the last first impressions for foundation you did, people's in the comments kept saying how they wished you applied a lighter layer first and did a wear test. \nThough I don't agree, cause I'm all about that cake too girl! I think that you doing both of those things in the video just once again proves why you're videos are the best. Really listening to your viewers and giving us what we ask for. Reinforces that you're the most trust worthy guru <3 /v Thanks so much for sharing your shades in different brands. Really helps a lot!!! /v It looked so smooth on your skin  /v Am I crazy or did this fenty sponge eat half of your foundation?  /v Now I have to buy the lipgloss /v I feel like you applied the contour/bronzer a lot better than most reviews I watched. Loved the idea of rubbing it on the brush first :) Since it does tug a bit on the face because of the waxy texture. /v love your videos amy, as always  /v I went to Sephora to mainly get the Fenty foundation,  but they're sold out of the 3 colors I could wear.  It was like Black Friday in there, crazy!  So I got the lipgloss and the \nhighlighter duo in Ginger Binge & Moscow Mule. I will eventually get the foundation /v I bought the universal gloss bomb this past Saturday and I wear it every single day lol. It smells like watermelon jolly ranchers. That's the scent you were looking for lol. I applied it on my channel too. I love the shade on my lips so much  /v Rihanna murdered that other brand!!! Seriously, they knew idiots will go out and spend anyways. who puts 0.9g in a tube and sell it for $30. /v I'm so glad you did a review.  I was hoping you would.  I've seen several others,  but you are certainly my go to. My make up collection is what it is because of your input. So thank you! /v Loved your video. What brand eye lashes do you wear my daughter would love these. /v Maybe your is shade 290, more neutral with a mix of olive tones. I had to go to Sephora to get color matched because what I thought was my shade was a hot mess when I tried it in store. Lol /v Did you set your face with anything? /v Glad to see a review with my color skin tone as I use 107 for L'Oral too ... will make it easier for me to go pick up my new foundation... can't wait !! /v U look so good even w out make up love u /v THANK YOU for using the beauty blender with this foundation! I'm so sick of every review using the fenty sponge when we alllll know that the beauty blender is always gonna be the ride or die /v Yes the foundation is Oxidizing. But I love matte foundation because I'm a oily person. /v I would love to see you try a new lip color! All of your looks are so beautiful but only incorporate one or two shades of lipstick. It'd be awesome to see you try all kinds of different colors. It was great to see you try lipgloss too! /v Did you end up finding the right foundation colour? /v Fenty beauty really hit the mark with being inclusive with this line. I love seeing super pale and super deep girls getting excited about a line that's catered to them. The gloss I think is my fav, I love universal colours that look amazing on everyone! /v the foundation matched the rest of your body, and the fenty blender application was so flawless... /v I WAS HOPING YOU WERE GONNA TRY TROPHY WIFE ... PLEASE TRY IT /v THANK YOU for saying your foundation shades in SO many foundations!!!! Biggest pet peeve is when youtubers don't mention the shade they buy in a foundation /v I love u Amy but make ur videos shorter they r way too long babe  /v The fenty sponge worked better...I noticed a difference in the application /v We're about the same shade in MAC (I'm a NC35) and I wear a 250 in the foundation /v Your foundation looks a bit oompa-loompa-ish /v Love the collection, and the blotting powder; hopefully if she grows the collection she will do various shades of a setting powder. \nThanks for the review love! /v The egg part \nLove love love your videos\nEverything looks super good on you!!! /v Your skin looks beautiful with this foundation omg /v No hate, just seems that this makeup makes you look splotchy and dirty?  Anyone? /v i'm a nc24 in mac what shade should i get ? /v What's your real shade reference that really matches your face? Are you like an nc20 from mac? I just want to pick a shade thank you :) /v Yes please do a shade update!! I wear Too Faced Born this Way in Sand  300 looked a lil too dark  /v WHAT LASHES IS SHE WEARING /v Here's a close up of the foundation. *still waiting* /v Would you suggest going a shade lighter since it looked like it oxidized? /v what brush did you use to highlight ??? /v Where's your clear brushes are from ? /v Why have not ever subscribed to you, its a crime that i'm this late, you did a fantastic job.  I loved all the information you gave, I loved how you showed how to fix the problem.  You are very good at what you do.  Plus you are stunning with or without makeup. /v Omg when you went to finish your make up your make up looks so good with the lashes. Looking bomb! /v It looks so pretty on you. /v (((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me. /v He really did it my god /v yoo! /v Is that cheerleader actually Ali Michael? /v This makes me wanna go travelling again!  amazing /v Best song in his reykjavik boiler room set... /v If i get it right a clip by Alasdair McLellan is young and beautiful people kissing each other all day long... all the time ?

Its not like they're ever gonna see it /v Lmao why did I think this would be a nice deep video ...... /v There's something calming and sweet about the first guys personality. /v How I see it, assholes come in every shape, size, colour, type and form. Doesn't matter what they are. /v Sum1 plz tell mi the chick iz a Pisces &/ or Venus in Capricorn /v Wish the whole world could think like this:( /v Isn't the saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so what does that mean if your eyes don't work  /v This is pretty much them trying to get on the trend page again. /v it's sad how they only talked about physical beauty /v The woman in blue is a horrible person. /v _The soul..._\n\nBoobs are good, but the most important thing is the soul. /v the guy with the brown shirt would never be cast in as a lead  in a romantic movie. /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v love is blind,,, love you all... /v How blind people sex preferences described? /v The guy summed it all up with other senses kick in. Anything above that is pure subjectivity. /v What a sweet video /v There is yes are open.... /v I have been completely blind ever since birth. Here's how I look at it. See the pun? Anyways, I view people as people and not by their physical appearance, unless I am going for a relationship. People do give me compliments quite often, but I never let it go to my head. I try my best to look as presentable as I can, but at the end of the day everyone has their own taste and there are plenty of people out there so I choose to just stay humble and let time speak for itself. I hate living with the condition that I do, but I never let it get the worst of me. I wake up every day just glad to be alive and to have a roof over my head. /v I was in this video, thank you to many of you for the kind words. In any project, the editors take and use what they want to make the video flow the way they want without input from the folks cast in the roles. I am a blind person, Im not perfect, and I have preferences related to what I find attractive in a partner, I also totally look at personality and if that person can make me laugh and that we have fun together.\nI was asked to do this, because I thought it would be fun, but reading the majority of the comments, I am sure, I will never do it again /v Ray Charles would use the wrists of women to get a sense of their looks. /v Is that blind girl single? Hook me up youtube! /v Is this a joke? Blind people are shallow....okay and thats okay???? /v Aw poor people they can't see anything :( there still amazing people /v The girl is cute. /v This comment section made me lose faith in humanity. /v Using blind people to spread you liberal propaganda?.....That's messed up. /v hahaha people have told me shes cute shes a hottie lmao imagine you went out with someone based off others opinion /v I don't think vision really plays that big of a role in beauty. . .\n\nUnless you can see. /v I had a weird experience once with a elderly blind man who in a away rejected me because of my looks :p I helped him at a event at my school and he was being really friendly towards me, but when I was trying to help him going down some stairs, he discovered that I am quite tall for a girl. Then it was like his whole attitude changed towards me.. really interesting experience! :D And I was only trying to help him.shallow person for sure /v They sound as shallow as somebody who can see. /v Do not be deceived...One of the first things they must notice...is...THE SMELL of a PERSON... So wash thoroughly people, wash thoroughly, if you want to date a blind person...And if you don't want to date one... WASH ANYWAY !!! LOL... :) /v Love these videos. thank you. /v I'm kinda disappointed I expected them to talk about beauty as in personality and not physical cus they are blind but It seems I was totally wrong XD /v Wow so superficial I thought this video was going to be more uplifting. Talk about how down to earth is beautiful how humility and novel feelings make someone beautiful etc. this people are shallow. Sad. /v Please more vids with the perception of daily, normal Things of deaf or blind People \nThat is so interesting and also helpful to understand them better /v The girl reminds me of summer from Rick and morty /v I see why blind people where glasses now. That's kinda scary tbh. But they're blind so I see why they don't have pupils /v Describing color to a blind person /v It's fascinating, hope it isnt offensive, to watch their eyes travel when they talk /v We nees to stop using phones night and take care of our eyes  no but really, sight is such a beautiful blessinh that I can't imagine my life without it  /v That blonde girl is super shallow. If someone goes to the gym that automatically means their attractive. Well she isn't so. /v Oh so they are just normal people... I would have never thought that even though they are blind they still think like normal people.. wow /v One thing I learned from this video is that if I go blind I will definitely be wearing dark glasses for the rest of my life /v Everyone can be an asshole, disability or not. /v first guy looks like human shrek /v Wow, even blind people don't give a single fuck about personality. That's literally all I care about , shallow people suck. /v Why do people feel need to walk next to a physically attractive person? It's such a sad thing that even blind people feel the same way /v So, blind people judge others by their looks even if they can't see them... to all you defending them, would you also defend deaf people who base someone's attractiveness on what their voice sounds like? /v These are some of the whiniest victim complex virtue signallers I have ever seen. What a waste of your fifteen minutes in the sun. Bitching about a few people who treated you awkwardly and blaming anyone with vision for their sight privilege. You wouldn't be you without any and all errors. What about the privilege of living in the first place? What weaklings. Except the black fella in the glasses. He was down to earth. /v I think vision is overrated.\n\nCOMING FROM A BLIND PERSON THAT  QUOTE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED! /v I liked how it fit with mine. Awe omg /v Mac is so cUTE what the FuCk /v How do they define beauty when they are blind and don't know what beauty is. Then people in the comments are like someone can teach them. First of all, if someone teaches you what beauty is, then beauty it is what they think and not necessarily what beauty is really for you.  Beauty is also subjective,  video should be called things blind people think are beautiful/fulfilling because they don't know and can't understand what beauty truly is. Video is absolutely stupid. /v The guy in the green really is very handsome /v all i got from this is that they trust other people. /v 3:55 I'm not blind but I agree totally /v Humans universally find the same physical attributes attractive, especially as they relate to fertility. When someone claims to prefer a certain non-optimal type, it really means that he/she has low self-esteem. /v I'm sure they'll feel otherwise if they had sight! /v The lady in blue is hot /v i liked what the man who had originally been sighted said at the end, second to last. /v Why don't they mic up the interviewer? It's distracting from the flow of conversation. /v Wow this was interesting. I expected them to be more open to dating someone based on the heart. Didn't expect so much physical judgment considering I'm sure they've been judged all their lives. /v I am glad this video was made. What a good production. /v Lol goes to show everyone is equally a douchebag. /v Once I was talking with a blind people group, and we asked what is beauty to you, and someone answered to me beauty is a word. /v What I thought was interesting is when they described beauty as thin and going to the gym.. I see beauty as, how they act, are they kind, are the self centered? like.... looks aren't everything. /v Ask black blind people what they think of racism /v These people are just answering questions smh y is everybody all triggered  /v @3:37 that was really cute :> /v Has someone told the first blind guy, that talked about his friend telling him he can date a fat girl and it wouldn't matter, that he himself is fit ??  /v The guy with nice hair reminds me of the twins from desperate housewives /v Thanks for sharing these peoples perspectives. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Up next, deaf people describe sound. /v 0:40 his voice is my headcanon kankri voice /v Why do their eyes look blurry? /v Cindy is so pretty /v You Guys Are Beautyful! Regards. /v God bless these people. /v 0:54 he looks  like idubbbz lmao /v Can someone fix homie's glasses?  /v Deaf people describe music pls /v Blind people like skinny people. /v Bless these people  /v 0:39 i- /v Up next deaf people describe fart /v O.J IS BLIND? /v OJ is a murderer. /v beautiful video. /v I Feel Bad Idk Why /v need more mac!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v soft haired dude is so cute /v Just go to google and simply type: *gamesecrx guide* You'll get the only real free secret tool completely FREE for this game. /v Humility not detected lol /v I loved it... /v What's sad is when humanity thinks of beauty...Or attractiveness. We only think of the body. Our hair,  The pigment of our skin, How much makeup up you have. And completely forget that true beauty.....is something that is created from within. It is our soul, How we treat others and how we treat ourselves, It is the smile upon our face, The good things we have too say about Others. Its what you believe in and support. Thats what makes you beautiful. If you have a good heart and care of others and the world, Treat people how you want too be treated, Dont gossip or belittle about others, Stay away from negative drama and showing yourself respect. THAT is true beauty. You can live with demons and expect too go too heaven (If you believe in such things) I dont hold any religious beliefs or wish too change others. Just sharing my own personal perspective that we hold within /v So many people in the comments were upset, and felt disillusioned because we blind people are people.\nRight after saying how shallow the girl was, someone would call her ugly or not attractive. Or people would talk about the deformed eyes (which isn't how all blind people's eyes look, by the way). But, you aren't being hypocrites at all.\nAnd why did you need this video to validate that inner beauty is important? If you don't actually believe it, or you find yourself thinking of the physical, why should blind people? We're all apart of the same society, affected by the same ideals.\nScent, the way someone's arm feels, the sound of their voice are all things we notice. But in such a visual world, why wouldn't a blind person also wonder at someone's physical appearance? I ask my friends for basic descriptions so that I have an idea of what the person looks like, and then their opinion. Sighted people get their friends' opinions as well and it isn't seen as shallow. It's what you do once you've learned all you can, if you decide how you feel about someone on appearance alone, that determines the kind of person you are.\nPS, someone said (I hope jokingly) that they expected them to say that beauty was black. If your fully blind, there is no blackness, or obstruction, it's just nothing. Think about the view behind your head, with only sound, touch, and scent to tell you what's happening. That's what a fully blind person sees. Though vision is on a scale, so blind may not mean fully/completely blind. /v I would totally date the blind girl! /v No. 45 IS a white supremacist.  It's been proven by his own actions. /v Fire her fire her. She black trash. Double standard u dumb fucks /v Why do ESPN have to fire her, that's freedom of speech and Scott doesn't know what's going on in the black community, he's too busy trying not to be a Black man in America. /v No.45 is a DouchBAG!!! /v this needs to be #1 trending!! /v I was spinning on a chair before clicking on this. I is dizziness now /v Man this is so dope /v Whatever it takes.

Man, this gave me chills- what an epic idea! /v Thank you Imagine Dragons for this amazing video. it is Trippy as can be and LOVE IT! Can't wait to see you LIVE & meet at the Barcalays Center next month :) Thanks Mac, TP & ID . You all keep me going, Ordering my VINYL EVOLVE this week! oh did I say one, i meant TWO :) /v it's so good :) /v They are in 2030 when we are still in 2017 /v ALSO WE SHOULD MAKE THIS A HASHTAG, TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THIS SONG!!!\n#WIT <---WHATEVER IT TAKES /v THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE IT 10/10 /v Love this song.

A problem I'm glad to have ha ha ha... It is also awesome if you position the video in a certain way it sort of feels like the opening credits of a Star Wars movie. /v I love this song!!!!! /v You guys never fail to impress us with your songs! /v HOW DOES THIS EVEN WORK!!! /v Who was here before 500k views? /v Am I the only one who almost cried during this video /v Who's here before 1M views? /v HOLY!!! WE CAN MOVE THE CAMERA VIEW OF THE VIDEO!!!!!  I'm I.T. /v Music like this makes me smile the most. Who needs songs about sexual actions when you have meaningful music like this? This is what music is all about. Pouring your heart into words, and showing a talent that you're lucky enough to have. /v THIS IS THE COOLEST LYRIC VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN /v Whoa technology!\n\nI love the 360 degree style of this /v I love it!! But it'd be great if during the chorus laser beams depicting the colours of the album would just shoot down!! /v soo cool  and great song!!!! i was waiting a video for this song. /v Well made and good song /v Holy shit!

Please help me out! :( /v Blake's voice is so soothing  /v Love  /v lots of air jordans have been saved by corteous afro americans from foot lockers...thank you for that. /v Usher could sing the phone book and make it sound good. Great performance for an even greater cause. /v Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others dont? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities? /v Simply Magnificent!!!!! They killed this!!!! Especially Usherthis man is a walking timepieceKing of RnB /v That's what it's all about people.We all need each other.What a humbling performance. /v My favorite song. So emotional right now. These lyrics are so beautiful and they give me a whole another perspective after what happened.. /v This reminded me of the tribute he did at Michael's funeral..great job usher /v Both of these guys are incredible acoustic talents... /v Spotify ....NOW PLEASE /v This shit is awful. /v Love those guys!! /v Beautiful wow /v WOW....class act /v God is good /v awesome ...............just awesome. /v Holy fuck, those are the types of fries I fuck with, look at that sexy ass salt just hugging the fuck outta it! I'll eat that sandwich, well both of them in one sitting! /v Jesus christ sean is so fucking smooth /v F*ck that's delicious. I've had that shit on pre-order since I knew it was coming out. Sits on my shelf next to Julia Child, Kent Rollins. /v Should of put coleslaw on Sean's. /v action's sandwich had my mouth watering till i saw the bread /v I haven't put too much effort into lunch recently, that might need to change.  I might pick up a copy of Action's book too. /v Need a recurring Sean & Action show pls. /v You can see in Action's eyes that he knew he lost lol...I love all three of these dudes tho. Keep doing your thing Sean, you're the best interviewer out there. /v I could watch Sean and Action Bronson every week. Mario Batali was a welcomed guest, they all had great chemistry on this episode. More of these 3 in future episodes hopefully. /v nobody is in house youre outside you fucking nerd /v Amazing. I love that it's not just a showcase of making amazing food, but directs the audience on how to learn to make amazing food in their own kitchens - bravo! /v Can't believe what I'm seeing. heart-attack in a bun basically, and when Mario Batalli launches himself into it, it's like seeing the alien dislodge its jaw and suck the life out of its victim. /v that cheese in Bronson's made me nut /v Bronson ALWAYS over compensates by throwing together fancy ingredients. Action, you're trying too hard! /v wow they got Mario on this shit! Daam Sean doing big things in the food world! /v We want more action Bronson one of my favorite rappers /v The amount of respect in Bronson's voice to Batali is heartwarming and shows his passion for cooking goes beyond doing it for fun. /v Mario is like you combines both of them lol /v Action Bronson is such a sweetheart. /v Those berries and jalapeno on fresh side pork has to be fantastic. /v I think this is my favorite YouTube video of all time /v action bronson looks like a t h i c c   bearded sean evans /v Mario Batali is slowly turning into former Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer. /v Action kinda seemed like a dick on the last episode he was on with Sean, but looks like they were best buds in this one, good shit. Also, I would devour both of those sandwiches lol /v In Pittsburgh or Pixburgh we pronounce it permanees... I'll let yinz pass n at /v I didn't even like ab before this show. I'm coming around. /v had a great time watching, thank you. /v Mario Batali looks like if Sean and Action had a baby /v Wow i learned lots from mario its nice to see him getting some street credit. /v I hope action bronson dies from being hit by a meteor.. a bus wouldn't do it /v Much love for the channel guys. Ive said it before i'll say it again. Hot Ones is the best, but Sean in the wild is a close 2nd ---- Plus I think its a secret way to get Sean out of his element, also know as weening him out of his hoodies! /v BamBam didn't put the jalapeos in the sauce, y'all. That's why they put in the 'ends'. Still, though, I'd have picked his hands down. Yum! /v Damn Mario Batali just made me think of a naked Action Bronson, why tf did he have to say that I was enjoying the sandwich eating /v The best part is when action has a heart attack and dies. /v No cooks will ever agree to this.. Raw Break on this ? Hope you like a soggy POS ! /v Sean Evans could make me a sandwich naked anytime he wants. /v Action's sandwich is like a fancy version of something you'd make when you're completely stoned. /v When can we see Mario on Hot Ones? /v Action Bronson is such a rookie!! Hes a terrible stoned chef... hes just a fat piece of crap who has some good raps, yet he is so untrained and unskilled, jagoff! Love my boy Sean Evans though! /v Great ingredients, probably great flavor combos, but why the fuck wonder bread? /v Action Bronson is kind of an ironic name given his size. /v This looks like Epic Mealtime but these guys are serious and think it's tasteful hahaha /v My new life goal is to grow a Bronson Beard /v That sandy look GARB AF Bronson. Cookbook on the way tho /v I love watching, all of, a great YouTube clip and then fully wanting to read the comments to see what other people think . In my convoluted way of talking, that basically that the video is that good! More of Sean and Bronson together please  /v I feel like if he never had that orange beard it wouldnt make him as unique. /v I am so happy this channel exists. It makes the world a better place. /v 8:05 sneak dissssssss /v Ew /v Viva Colombia y viva el chicharrn! Aguante Action Bronson papaa! /v What a COLLAB /v Fire Sauce Bacon Sizzling Remix to RICO! https://youtu.be/BElfKHvqWV4 /v Brilliant vid /v love it /v *Fuck!* /v Love Mario /v Batali being a crazy good sport /v Action your look better /v Hes the shit /v Love action Bronson...love his viceland show /v Sean Evans jus through some shit together /v Damn, those shoes tho Bronson. /v Those sandwiches look amazing /v Damn Action got stacks /v All of the 3 guys go well together, humour is nice and not forced. Great vid. /v Shouts out to Primanti's. Here in Pittsburgh we put fries on everything and win Stanley Cups /v What type of cheese did he use? /v sean could have even mixed the tapatio and maple syrup together in kinda a hot honey style glaze for this sammie /v These guys need a show together. /v what a heart attack meal. Fat there, fat everywhere..can't imagine bambams vains in 10 years /v He's like a fat Post Malone /v An obese guy makes a cook book on how to eat healthy... /v Action looks so happy when Mario compliments him. I love it. /v As a Pittsburgher it warms my heart to even hear pramanti bros. mentioned here. /v and me here failing to boil eggs.... /v fat fuck u trash with the rest of this generation of so call rappers /v Bronson's sandwich LOOKED good but I'm not confident about the taste at all. /v Classy rapper. He knows how to present himself. I would love to hear his stories. /v Never eat anything Action cooks, it may have a hair in it for sure. /v them jeans suckk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nthe really make ur legs look messed up this is to help the channel /v As delicious as they look I'd rather have Action's money knot. Holy fuck /v What shoes action b have on?? /v What a great episode. I loved every moment of it. :-) Keep up the great work you guys and keep them coming. I liked the different style of it from Hot Ones and this was a pleasure to watch. /v Ruin it with white Wonder bread. /v Probably the whitest cast on YouTube /v I'd give me my left nut for either of those sandwich. /v He's always super baked. /v Actions dank sandwich, served on wonder bread wtf? /v Colombian Chicarron=Heaven!!! Action's Sandwich looked delicious! /v Gross. Too fatty for me. /v Action Bronson looks like a viking. Ducked Ragnar lothbrook looking ass lol /v Action Bronson  is a big Fucking baby and disrespectful scum bag. Fuck this Rolly Polly. /v That pork looks beautiful /v im high as fuck /v I want those sandwiches, damn. /v FUCKING EXCELLENT EPISODE MAN /v 8:25 Scary shit. /v Bronson's sandwhich looked a fuck load better /v How could you not fuck with action Bronson he'll smoke you out and cook a bomb ass meal!!!! IT DONT GET MORE  THAN THAT!!! /v Thought it was all guys come out closet lol jk /v The red digital crown ruins the look for me. I know you can get something to put over it, but still.. it doesn't go with any color Apple Watch. /v I hate people telling me Android did it first. \n\nApple did it right. \n\nHave you seen how ugly the other smart watches are? \n\nHave you seen how bad the other smart watches software is? /v I hate this color too :D /v It will be nice if it was a standalone device with its own App Store and wireless headphones included. /v Apple Watch 1 + red sharpie = Apple Watch 3 /v Why do you still need a phone to pair it? /v do we have two sizes? /v can you give from series 2 /v Should I get this or the series 2 /v Looks like a cheap watch for kids. /v absolutely no immeasurable difference between all 3 of them /v What did he say at the end? /v They should of made it thinner  /v Comments:\nMy android phone did this in 2009\nSomething clever about how it's just red\nSteve jobs would hate this Spicy Orange strap /v Need some help here. Can Watch series 3 sync with all iphone version? /v If that was the iwatch with the bloodsugar meter...i would buy it...but is just another smartwatch... /v Hey definitely ruined this with the fucking red thing how ugly is that /v I have a apple watch series1 but I want to get the series 3 /v you can see the phone complication up there.... Complication?? Give me a break /v Can use old strap on this? /v Yea no thanks, the series 3 without LTE is fine. /v Has the Apple Watch 3 now also the Qi standard or how does it work with the charging via AirPower? /v the red crown is almost a deal breaker for me. /v the ending has me weak /v And the Academy Award for photography goes to... /v You definitely don't have to upgrade from a Series 1 maybe from the first generation /v might want to blur your number at 4:04 /v ...soon the news will have ''teenager mugged for his apple watch 3...''......... /v built in obsolescence - not worth it. /v Pshhh... forget my phone I have lte data on my watch -my future self /v Hope you're not too busy with call blocking haha /v Thats the best color! /v 913 /v Flashed your phone number at 4:05 probably want to blur that out  /v Dumb /v I could go on eBay and buy a more advanced and better looking watch  for a quarter of the price of this pice of Sh**t  /v Frankly, why can't Apple come up with better form factors for the watch?  Why does it have to look so effeminate and generic that is so bland and boring?  Seems the place (Apple) is run by engineers.  None of the products raise any heartbeats.  One would expect more from the richest company in the world! /v Looks like a beef burger not a watch. And no always on? give a break with this shit /v stupid idea to make the  button red. Apple is being destroyed by B grade designers. /v ...the speaker was om MUTE...Dummy......;-),,,,,,,, /v Nobody wants your phone number /v 3 generations and same design . boooooo /v so what about the rest of the world that uses sim cards to get service /v Can you text from it? /v That Watch looks sooo sweet. I had the original Apple Watch and ended up selling it but I'm gonna ditch the Fitbit for Watch 3  /v I got your phone number! *HA HA HA* /v As someone that is in the smartwatch industry, everything about the watch is pretty awesome. /v SAR rating??? Strapping a cell phone to your wrist doesn't sound like the smartest idea. I do like it though. If you had to buy one thing this Apple event this is it. /v Why can't the look change or get thinner? /v Can someone please explain what it means to have the LTE? If I buy the non LTE, can I still use my watch without having my iPhone on my at all times? /v I don't care who makes a watch but LTE is no place for a watch. This is just another way to justify the price of a device across the board nut just Apple. How fast can the OS of a watch run? It's a damn watch, so buy the watch cuz it's fast then buy iPhone 4 just to make calls? Until there is something significant that the series 2 watch can't do, then it's a waist of $$$$$. /v good review. thanks! /v Im really for it, it really depends on how much it will cost monthly. It better not be any more than 10 dollars /v is it water proof? /v Is the series 3 going to work on tattooed wrists unlike the last 2? The last 2 series would not stay unlocked on a tattooed wrist. /v is that a cellular one ? /v If i made a watch with a video cam and fm radio it would sell way better then the piece of crap isuck lol /v Does anobody know: \n\nWill the new heart rate monitoring stuff be made available to the older Apple watch revisions as well? /v Piss on the nfl! Payback for allowing players to sit or take a knee during the National Anthem has turned me off of pro football. Time to follow some college teams IF they don't do the same. /v 1:44  look at the ref /v lmao who else saw the ref fall at 1:43 /v 7:53 is my favorite part of the game to be honest. was so hyped up and proud of that moment. just wish we could be like that the first half half rather than run the middle and pass on 3rd and long /v Man on that int. Fowler is held up as soon as he turns back. I fully understand the within 5 yards rule. But defensive player just grabs his jersey and hangs on. Total missed call. Also broncos need to play with their foot on the gas. If the did this wouldnt of been as close. Just fighting against the clock the whole last 1/3 of the game. /v I don't care what anyone says, give Siemian an Oline and he's one of the league's best QBs. Every time he had enough protection, he made amazing throws. And when the run game was working, it opened up the pass. That's how football works people. Before you call a QB shitty, look at their supporting cast first. /v All women announcers sound like adolescent boys. /v LOL the referee fell on the sideline at 1:36 /v Moved to a new city but the Chargers still suck /v If they would have called the defensive holding like they should have then the interception is voided and the momentum never shifts and I do believe the Broncos would have won like 27 to 7 or even 30 to 7. Crazy how 1 no call affects the entire game. Denver looked better than anyone is giving them credit for. Just saying. Not the best team in the NFL but just stating facts. /v Chargers have one of the most underrated defense in the league /v They REALLY need another announcer!!  Can't tell whether this one is a guy, a chic, or Tatoo from Fantasy Island....but the voice is utterly distracting.... /v touchdown los angeles! Just made me cringe, doesn't sound right with the chargers /v 1:43 top of your screen... that poor guy XD /v New commentator please. This made the game so cringy /v In my book it should of went OT I heard no whistles on the 1st kick /v Siemian had a surprisingly good game. Not bad for a 7th round pick haha /v Pass interference missed on interception by Phillips.....How do you missed that? /v I thought the commentator was a guy who didn't hit puberty /v Even in Los Angeles the Chargers cant win lol /v Why bother being a female sportscaster if you have to speak with the forced cadence of a man? You don't see me trying to pec-feed a newborn. /v 0k /v Terrible announcers /v Trevor siemian is Peyton manning to lol /v Go Go Broncos /v Kiss George's feet eke /v Peep the ref @ 1:45 /v good game /v 1:42 ref biffs it /v Trevor looked amazing.\nTJ certainly looked missed... /v Same sorry ass bolts. /v 1:43 - RIP Ref /v Who saw the ref eat it 1:40 /v The ref falling at the top of the screen at 1:43  /v Game was good but the announcers made it as boring as possible /v If your going to let the unsportsman like conduct of having time outs on kickers kicks, then you should at least show me the first kick that went over on the highlights NFL, if your too embarrassed to show the time out being used in such a way then outlaw it. /v The ref really falls though  1:43 /v Did they get one of the lollypop kids to do play by play? /v 5 ads in a 10 minute video, da fuq? /v Afc west is afc best. /v That's why San Diegians did not want to approve a new stadium on the ballot, just a waste of a new stadium good riddance /v How is this 22 on trending /v Karma for the chargers leaving San Diego  /v Call me sexist if you want, but football doesn't sound right with a female commentator. /v What's you're guys favorite NFL team? Mines the cowboys and ravens. /v I'm all for equality but I didn't like the fact that a women was commentating pretty much the whole game, it kind of ruined it. /v Who else saw the ref fall over at 1:44  /v 1:42 look at the ref /v Look at the sideline referee at1:41 /v 1:43 \nGround- 1\nReferee- 0 /v I knew something would go wrong for the chargers /v I was there! Such an amazing game. /v I had to turn my volume down so I didn't hear that annoying voice. /v Why do the chargers always lose to the broncos? Lol /v Simply go to google and simply type: *gamesecrx guide* You will receive the only one working method fully FREE for this game. /v how old is the announcer? /v It was a good game but they both looked sloppy, Denver lost the momentum after they scored the field goal and the Chargers scored 14 unanswered point, Trevor got sacked a lot and stopped scrambling after Bosa got him from behind, lol. The Chargers' defense salvaged the game with those fortunate two lucky turnovers and the offense wasnt too impressive (except for TD pass to Travis Benjamin), Gates only got 1 catch, no Hunter Henry, the run game non existent in the second half limiting them to throwing a lot because they fell way behind. But at least it was fun to watch those Denver fan sweat as the game was possibly going into over time. Not so HIGH and mighty huh Orange Mush. Lol /v God bless you guys and your families /v Denver got no chance Zeke going run all over Denver. /v Wow I know these are just highlights but wow the Semian made a bunch of crazy needle threading passes. /v Ppl always clown on the broncos. Yet we have the toughest division in the nfl. Our games are always so close. /v The Chargers have too many defensive weapons to be that timid early on. They honestly have the potential to be a top 5 defense in the league. /v can't believe they lost the lead.. /v He made his voice deeper at 2:40 in the 2nd quarter /v The broadcasters were horrible, thanks for making us feel like you don't care about us, ESPN. Rex and some random lady, please hire an actual crew in the future. Somehow you make a great Broncos game feel like a chore. But it wasn't, was it? This was one of the best games all week!\n\nOn the Broncos front, we might have made a huge mistake by cutting TJ Ward and will be drafting Safety high next year. We still need a better O-line in places. Siemian improved a lot, Jamal Charles is old. Poor Jamal. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Rivers waits too long to get desperate..it takes 2 to 3 quarters to figurr out what is going on.  They use too many short runs down the middle.very predictable..He needs to throw more long balls and use Gates more often. /v My west is looking good /v not trying to hear her deep ass voice /v Commentator was pretty good, idk why everyone is complaining /v Rip ref like if u know what im talking about /v I don't like this sportscaster  sounds very annoying /v The girl did just fine y'all are dicks. /v Denver has a good QB idk why people are tripping bout him....... /v You may think that the chargers lost...\n\n\n\n\nBut they didn't get injured, so thats a win in my book. /v denver qb has a strong arm /v 1:42 the ref slips /v He is the most accurate kicker in Denver history\n\n\n\n*MISSES FIELD GOAL* /v Wow a block field goal this reminds me of ravens vs browns /v Its like denver was trying to give the game away /v Broncos Defense and Offense is gonna be too much for the cowgirls this Sunday, especially with the fact that they're playing in Mile High Stadium. The Broncos will last all game, while the cowgirls will be winded in the 4th quarter in the higher elevation. /v 1:43 the ref got juked by casper /v YoungHOOOE! /v Replay of chargers vs broncos game last season chargers miss game tying field goal /v New color commentators...\n\nRomo: 10/10\nRyan: Boring/10 /v Peace olde /v they are trash /v 1:44 the ref falls /v Talib goat another Superbowl win this year /v Ref slips @ 1:45 /v Chargers 0-4 stay tuned for week 5 /v I clicked for Sergio Dipp.  I was disappointed. /v Just like the chargers CHOKE /v Thouchdown Los Angeles? /v Ellen DeGeneres is narrating the game? /v Sad that Kasim Edebali is not playing /v Came here for Sergio Dipps /v lol most accurate kicker in denver history and misses...  sportscaster jinxed it.. /v Football is for faggots = /v Can someone explain to me why there was no PI called on Desmond King at 6:38?  Is it because they're at the line of scrimmage? /v that nose highlight !!!!  /v Bonne Bell was my favorite!! /v Smells like teen spirit /v i love your hairstyle!!! /v What...is...that highlighter!? /v I miss the 90s!!! /v CosmoGirl!

Boy child   /v OMG I loved the 90s, I was born in 1985 I am a 90s kid. I loved things like Pogs, Marbles, Sega Genesis, the original playstation and all those sorts of things. I was never really into beauty products except lipsmackers and there was another chapstick I used that was glittery, but it wasn't lip gloss. Man so nostalgic, it makes me want to cry because I miss the 90s so much! /v +grav3yardgirl  *Caboodles of California started in the mid-1980's,* and they subcontracted the actual boxes to a manufacturer in your area:  Plano Molding Company, Plano, TX, USA, who makes bank on plastic tool and tackle boxes.  I recognize the boy band photo in the well:  Maurice Starr (BMI) had all sort of photographic stuff to promote his pet project, then-Columbia/Sony recording artists New Kids on the Block, and the group was actually featured on an edition of _People Weekly,_  a still-in-circulation Time Warner periodical. /v Bunny, your makeup, hair, outfit....everything is on point! /v Bunny how old are you? /v Teen spirit is sold at Dollar Tree :P /v I'm 26 and miss everything from the 90's! I remember all the good stuff from the 90's but they do still produce all of those things that were in that caboodle..well besides the magazine...most of it you can find at dollar stores. I still have my caboodle from 1999, its a light purple color. My favorite thing was the roller glitter, it was a little glass bottle with a large roller on top and had a clear liquid with glitter inside you could roll it on your chest, face, arms EVERYWHERE! It was the IT thing along with MUDD chunky shoes! And I miss the cool overalls they used to have in the 90's! /v 1998 the birth of awesome stuff like the birth of meee /v OMGGGGG pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee bunny i am begging you for the people mag. i am a die hard (nkotb)blockhead and would love to have it! lol  i am dying seeing that lol so want it! dang i should of bought this lol. /v I'm 32 and use Teen Spirit Deodorant lol it smells so good!

But it was nasty. /v Lol that magazine came out one day before I was born /v Hair so kawaii I can't even. /v I HAVE THE TEEN SPIRIT DEODORANT IT SMELLS SO GOOD!!!!! /v My absolute favorite lipstick in the 90s was Ultima II's LipSexxxy long lasting lipstick in a raisin color. It was more red than raisin and I thought it looked awesome on Me! It would dry you lips out though. These were the precursor to today's liquid lippies. /v How in the world did you do your hair so cute and sassy, Bunny?!? /v I would love to see some more 90@80s /v Does anyone remember the body glitter roll bottle? That was my jam in the late 90's. /v Bunny: *who doesnt like Micheal Jackson*\nMe: people who dont have an awesome taste in music\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPs im 13 and i grew up around  micheal jackson songs and i remeber being soo excited when he made this is it' /v i swear i had one of those caboodles when i was a kid for all my makeup (lip gloss mostly flavored) /v We (sisters)would keep nail polishes in our caboodle and use the little trays to dump out the colors to swatch or test them lol.

This video is gold. /v I saw this song get played live for the first time! Was fucking awesome. /v When Corey dances at pole, I was like My eyes, my eyes /v My god this is very good, thanks StoneSour /v This singer looks a lot like slipknot's singer . /v 80's glam rock/hair metal bands are watching this crying to themselves and saying, Maaaan...we dressed like this before it was cool.. /v is like the island that Sanji was 2 years /v Hottest music video ever  Also, this isn't Corey's first time in drag... /v Wayyyy not a good look for you dear!!! lol ;)))} /v im slightly aroused and confused by this, time to fap. /v yeah yeah we get it corey in drag and shit  but LEXXIIII asdhakjdcjdcb <3 /v This is my aesthetic /v God Damn, Corey! Now this must've been a fun video to make. /v Corey Taylor in drag is love /v owlook the members of steel panther /v Subscribe to the channel, Stone Sour drum covers) https://youtu.be/CIUglwS877o /v One of the best songs off the album in my opinion /v From Mxico with love  /v When i see men with makeup i only think marylin manson /v I would have preferred St Marie but that works to. Reminds me of the drag Halloween performance. /v Just here for steel panther.. /v I love this video /v this was really disturbing....great song though! /v Love this song but this video not my fave. Would've preferred something not so goofy for this song. /v Well, this isn't what I wanted.\nI'm glad it's what I got though. /v God damm some ugly girls playing in Stone Sour /v Genial! Hasta me olvide que estaba enferma viendo el video. Chau fiebre!  /v Everyone's talking about how crazy the video is and ignoring the fact that the song itself is pretty good /v They use the same hairstylist? /v If you love Stone Sour like I do, check out Stone Prophet! You'll dig 'em! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmh7rmgurpA /v I wanna tip Corey on the ass (no homo) /v Lost my shit at drag queen corey /v Alright enough dicking around, get back to Slipknot. the big boys /v IT'S THERE NOTHING THAT COREY MOTHER F-ING TAYLOR CAN DO????!!!!........ /v So should I be creeped out or aroused? Ahh fuck it. Corey Taylor in drag and pole dancing? TIME TO FAP  /v I was f* waiting this  /v I feel like I just watched one of my hero's have gay sex. /v Of course steel panther is in this lol /v Now I wonder what Corey thinks about Corey dancing on a pole. /v 1.This was either very satisfying or something from my strange nightmares. 2. I wonder what his kids are thinking when they are just watching YouTube and their dad acting like a stripper shows up. But in all honesty the video was awesome /v This is why I love Corey Taylor /v This is a refreshing change from the norm. And it's good to see they don't take themselves too seriously. /v Woo~ This is very funny video... Omg Omg... Lol~ Love that Solo /v Nothing shocks me when it comes to Corey Taylor after the pink tutu at a Halloween concert but DAMN TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!! /v Gonna be a video to laugh at for years. Fucking awesome. /v I love Stone Sour and even though this is not their best album, I 've thought of it as a very good stuff...until this fucked up video appeared, what the hell? Gimme back my Stone Sour, apart from this crazy shit video footage, the song does not even deserve to have a video. Get back Jim or rename, this is not what I thought it would be like without him.\nSorry for toxic opinion /v When u realize cory's wife is in the video handing home ones  /v I can't wait to see both of these bands  in Fargo on September 28! /v Some things just can not be unseen. And I am 99% sure that Corey Taylor came up with the idea for this video /v  dammit... I'm seriously jealous of your skills on the pole Corey Taylor.. Totally Fabulous 's /v Not my proudest fap /v MY FAV SONG ON THE ALBUM FINALLY HAS A VIDEO /v Second time Corey dresses like a woman.... second and counting... /v Honestly , what the fuck was this? /v Wow, you were forced to watch this rubbishquite closely more than ONCE?!?!?! I admire your strength to endure it!But thanx, all CinemaSins are absolutely guilty pleasures. /v How did David got his body back? /v everything wrong with Shooter would be a good one /v The only movie that is worse that this, is sw ep7 poop. /v You forgot the shitty ass prop guns made from 1980-2017 firearms rather than make something cool, like a precursor to the M41A Pulse Rifle. /v Ridley Scott is basicly killing his own creation with the Prometheus trilogy!  /v Good movie ... for a prequel but I'm still waiting for the proper Aliens sequel. /v Why the fuck would they kill off shaw or better yet, the engineers?! This movie pissed me off more then Wreck it Ralph /v Have you guys done anything to commemorate your large numbers of subscribers? /v I know the movie has a number of problems, but even as a film major, I can't deny I love this movie. The first in the series since Aliens that I've actually enjoyed /v All of this can be reconned away very easily. So I just want to see where Scott is going with this. Guess it's like someone watching a drunk friend trying to do something. I want to see if he pulls this off or fails badly and we all laugh at it. /v WHAT!!! still not at LV426......FUCK!!!! /v Everything wrong with pirates of the Caribbean: deadmen tell no tales in 15 minutes or less /v i know im not the only one waiting for the emoji movie review... /v Does anyone else get a feeling of dj vu when I watch this plus what is with the movie sin counter 2.0 /v CinemaSins, I've got one you can add. In the scene when the crew was walking through the wheat, one of the crew members appears to be eating the wheat. Mind you, not one crew member conducted any kind of analysis before hand to even determine if the wheat was edible and yet, one of them is eating it. I know this is a work of fiction but really?! Another problem I had with this film is its trying to be Event Horizon. If you recall, the crew on that ship were following a beacon signal and not knowing or understanding its origin or who even made it. The rescue team has little to go on and have no idea of the evil they're about to face. Yep, its Event Horizon all over again. /v Watch me. I'll do the fingering. No thank you. Last time I tried that, I got in trouble with the wife..... I didn't know you were married. /v Also I think that the ship is meant to do that and the purpose is to wipe out a planet and start again but a side effect is that the black goo creates xenomorphs or something. ( the worms in Prometheus) /v that woman who is the captain is a super ugly manboy lesbian twat /v And the engineers made the black liquid to destroy mankind on Earth. It shows you in Prometheus /v Just waiting for IT ,3, /v You also forgot the fact that the old robot that tried to replace the new robot couldn't heal but the new robot could so that should've been a giveaway to the crew that it wasn't their robot but the old crazy one they found on the planet /v *sigh*\n\nI guess we're stuck with Movie Sin Counter 2.0...\n\nIt's EFFING YELLOW! /v I'm just sitting here sad the the xenos died again. Can one live to the end of a movie and not get killed? No, ok. :( /v DO Stephen king's IT!!!!!!!!!! /v Even though it is like I see the whole movie by watching this, I feel like I had to force myself since I watched the others already. /v Got the balls to sin....Iron Giant? /v please do the pirates of the caribian dead man tell no tales /v Trash most of it it only his opinion /v Do Everything Wrong with Transformers The Last Knight /v Lotta hate for this movie in the comments, I liked it a decent amount, but I also haven't seen the originals since i was a litto wee lad /v I wanted this movie to be good, so badly. But no. All the questions from Prometheus left incompletely answered, plus MORE questions. I think Ridley Scott's thesis is that humans are too dumb to live. /v Can you do: Everything wrong with Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2? /v Please do the End of Evangelion. /v This movie was trash!! /v This movie was boring /v What Hardcore Henry or IT /v Everything wrong with the movie It 1990 please /v Just throwing this out there, ofc Walter and David look exactly the same - they're Walter AI'S... they're supposed to look the same. /v Am I the only 1 bothered by the yellow and font of movie sin counter 2.0 /v PLEASE DO A CINEMASON ON IT /v You missed a sin.wait, why do the trucks fall downward after impaling the xenomorph, I'm sure the ship is equiped with gravity generators but There's no gravity beyond the hull in space so how is this achieved? Shouldn't it just kind of float away, like in GravityOh yes Georgey, they float /v Why did the engineers not have an armada in space to inspect incoming ships before they come into the atmosphere /v do the Road to El Dorado you cowards /v EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE MASK!! /v He didn't cover that spores are way more sensible than giant eggs /v Is it just me or is the guy reviewing this one of those small minded fake god fearing pricks... /v They should do everything wrong with the original IT. And then do the new one /v Basically they sent only the dumbest motherfuckers to colonize a planet /v this video is so much better than the movie.... god damn it ridley scott /v 11:44 actually that is a xenomorph /v Transformers the last knight is out /v Hey, screw you, I have ears that clean. I clean them every single day as part of my shower/shave/brush teeeeth morning routine. /v Animated Movie sins?.... Captain Underpants? Wow you did the boss baby a week ago /v Now I want to see this movie for myself. When the damn DVD coming out? /v Haven't watched yet but for the love of god I hope they mention the fact no one hears gunfire inside whats essentially a cave system. /v This video is really terrible /v do psycho! come on man. /v Fuck this movie and all it stupid fucking Christian overtones /v Do Death Note (Live Action) it is perfect for this channel! /v I thought this movie was set on earth /v 2:11 But you didn't pass them right? Because you usually do need to do the homework to get a passing grade right? Teach me oh wise one. /v I bfidn see it i still want to /v Please do King Arthur: Legend of the Sword /v I enjoyed this film. The atmosphere, the tone. Fassbender's performance. Though there are some problems. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArLRJ9-0X8g /v Please do Everything Wrong with Death Note (2017) /v Everything Wrong with 47 meters down /v You should do Marie Antoinette next /v This proper shit movie got me really angry. A shop keeper would have made more intelligent decisions than this idiotic ''astronauts''. I also have a question. How do those while aliens see ? They have no eyes. LOLAnother sin not mentioned is, if they clearly saw while exploring the new planet that their guns have so little to no impact on killing the aliens, why do they continue to use the exact useless gun for the rest of the movie ? /v The bloopers at the end are my favorite part of the video! Hilarious /v Moral of the story? Don't bring religion with you, its going to kill everyone. Also worst CGI ever! /v should do 2001: A Space Odyssey /v BTW...Space is fake, NASA lies, earth is Flat....do you own research. /v It was a good movie and a Lot of Special Effects. When you consider the cost the time the expense involved not to mention the cast and crew the Employment Created for so many People it is too easy to Criticise. However i understand your Humour but give some Credit to the Film Makers. After all it is Science Fiction and a Limited Budget.  I give it Thumbs UP. /v Hard to watch video. Most of the points are ridiculous and the guys voice and way of speaking is annoying as fuck. /v This movie is so bad /v Worst movie in the franchise. Even Prometheus had more redeeming qualities. God. Can't believe I paid good money to watch this trainwreck. Left me slumbering like untold aeons. /v You had me at I am Groot. /v David created the xenomorphs. DINGDINGDINGDINGDING /v Really... Prometheus II. /v Long live Movie Sin Counter 2.0! /v DO SAUSAGE PARTY /v Do the movie 9 /v Everything wrong with Whiplash please. /v Uyyy papi you're trending so hard uuuuuuyyyy /v Do IT 2017 /v Like for Lucius! /v EWW scream 4 please! /v Do IT please! /v Do fucking 47 meters down please /v NICE /v do It /v Gaurdians of the galaxy vol 2 cinemasins /v good really good jaja /v This movie is such garbage. I've seen rape porn that was more gentle than what the 21st century is doing to the alien franchise. /v Like how these used to like 8 minutes then they discovered ad rev /v What's with the Sin Counter 2.0? It's weirding me out. Especially with the yellow. I can't focus on the screen. /v Now do \n\n\nEverything Wrong With IT /v Do deep blue sea /v In addition to all the things you pointed out, the thing that really bugged me in this movie was the preachy in-your-face pro-faith, anti-science theme. In case anyone was as dumb as the crew, they went to the point of stating it explicitly up front (which you sinned). Fine in veggie tales. Annoying in Alien. /v I wish I could grab those cupcakes out of my phone screen and eat while watching  /v I'm lovin' the new music! who thought cupcakes could have such attitude =P /v OMG...you should start a cupcake book!!!!! /v Hey guys! Let me introduce you to a fun little series Ive been working on. These are my 5 in 5 videos. Dont worry! Ill still be uploading two new videos each week with me talking in them, but I thought it could be fun to show off some of my past recipes in some compilation videos high are purely just eye candy and a little more fast paced! Ive got loads of ideas for my 5 in 5 series. Ive got some fall themed ones and a vegan one too. Ones made up of easy cupcakes, ones perfect for weddings, baby showers and their parties too! Hope I havent caused too much confusion with this video and I hope you guys love them as much as I do! :0) /v I'm italian and I think you're talented and fantastic! Though I don't understand all you say, I watch all your videos. I love your gentleness and your creativity, so don't stop to make recipes because from Italy I will continue to follow you! Ps. Sorry for my terrible english /v just for curiosity... do you have colorful tables or floors?! I love the wooden pastel color backgrounds /v i love the new edition of your videos /v I like this style of video but I wouldn't want all your videos to be like this, I like you talking through it and seeing you :) but I feel like this is a great video and you should do these now and then :))) /v I love Ferrero Rocher...  /v Anybody just narrating this for yourself like he would in his voiceovers?\n\n\n\nNo just me k. /v Don't you just love how the video is 5:00 long \nSo pleasing /v I'm suddenly not on a diet anymore /v Can you collab rosanna pansino please. /v This video is soooo cool nick pls do more! /v Bravo! Found you a few days ago and I'm hooked! Thank you for all of this hard work and sharing it with the world! /v No views and 1 like.GO HOME YOUTUBE YOU'RE DRUNK /v  /v I think you should do a diva series for cupcakes highlighting famous men and woman and making cupcakes from their more memorable roles/movies in hollywood as well as musicians. You've done Beyonce and Friend of Dorothy. I think it would be really cool to spend a week doing a certain theme or series. \n\nExamples: Lady Gaga, Madonna, Barbara Streisand, Rihanna, etc. Different artist in Hollywood and you can have a cake or cupcake to match an iconic moment in their careers. /v the amount of talent you have is endless please keep this series rolling /v Luv the idea of the 5 in 5 series can't wait for more! /v Do you use a bowl scraper attachment for your stand mixers? /v Quick graphic design question. How do you make the text flicker like that? /v Nick, did you watch glee you just sound like the kind of guy who did (I love glee). /v I love everything about chocolate  /v I love them all! Amazing /v do more of these videos!!! /v I am so happy that you are doing cupcakes with kit kat bars. It was my idea. Yay! Love you Nick! /v i remember these on snapchat!! satisfying video nick :) /v I'm really sorry, but as soon as I heard this music I thought of Markiplier's 'I have no friends' video... anyone else?  /v I didnt know a cooking video could be so lit /v Does this guy have a store? /v Id love to see you on Cupcake \nWars :) /v Love this style of video :O Would love to see more videos like thiis with other top 5 cupcakes so please make that if you enjoyed makin this one :D /v Heyyyyyyyyyyy\nYou should do a lavender and lemon flavored cupcake /v YES must eat one of the Kit Kats that got added to the batter. /v The aesthetic of your videos is actually GORGEOUS. You're actually amazing. /v I die every time you core a cupcake :,( /v Do more videos like this /v OMG I'm loving this complication like this is soothing anyone else feeling chilled watching. U should make a cookbook I would definitely buy it and bake everything /v Nick's recipes are a gift we do not deserve <3 <3 <3 /v Fall??

Plz keep them cummin!!! /v Make more videos like this! /v I love the kit Kat cupcake! I made it for the Kenwood competition  /v It's so satisfying that this is exactly 5 minutes long /v I love this new style of editing and the flavors all seem amazing! /v These look amazing \nCould you please provide egg substitutes :) /v You should try a cupcake with poprocks in it /v Great video!! Something to please everyone. Our power went out on at noon Monday during Irma and just returned at noon today. I can't wait to bake one of these!! /v I LOVE THE MUSIC YAAAS !!! /v I Like the Music & Chocolate of coarse  /v U Should Make More Video Like Dis:) /v hi i love your videos!!!!! /v Can't believe I'm so early /v I'm coming over. /v OMG! /v Vegan recipe !!!

I prefer you talking :) /v Great video, they look stunning but i see something different in all the recipes, you didn't add the oil and greek yogurt as you usually do, you changed the recipes? /v Nice video, but it seems colder compared to your older videos. It misses your flare to it............... /v omg the kitkat one!  ps: aaaaw I liked it when you talked at the beginnings and ends tho. /v These are five of my favourite cupcakes! Love the new style of video! /v I don't get the five minutes bit /v I really like the video but it felt like something was missing then i remembered the you weren't talking in it. /v DM + Corbijn = Magic. /v Why is he wearing this komunist CCCP flag??? /v The best song of the album /v Love this song, it has so much meaning to me and my life. Another best from Depeche Mode...thank you ! /v Great video for a great song so reflexing very Corbijn similar to Enjoy The Silence video and Cover Me is one of my favourite tracks from Spirit along with Going Backwards, The Worst Crime, So Much Love and You Move /v This is so perfect in every single way.  Oh my gosh. Instant classic. /v The best song of lbum /v get more subscribers by going to u2bzone (dot) C O M btw good video /v One of the most beautiful songs,its sound is pure magic! Thank you Dave for this masterpiece  DM Soundtrack of My Life. /v This video kinda destroyed me a bit. Unless I am interpreting it wrong, this is sad. Dreaming and pretending, but never reaching goals. /v Gosh, they still can make It! /v This is so magic!! /v I'm Lucky Enough to live quite close to the intro location.. so I took a Bike Ride down earlier! https://youtu.be/8e5qbTtb4V8 /v decades and yet still amazing songs and videos from you guys. /v They kicked ass in D.C. and NYC!!! /v Dave has always flown me to the moon :-) /v oh....graceful as fuck. Only the Mode can do this. /v I never expected to love this track as much as I do now when I first heard it. One of the absolute KILLIN'est tunes in the live show, too!!! Long live DM. /v For me this was the highlight of the current tour...visually and musically...STELLAR track! /v One of my favourites from the new album.  I have been listening to this so much in the past few weeks. And this video just captures it all. Amazing.  I most likely will get emotional when they play this at the concert here in Dallas next week, so preparing myself. DM forever... :)  <3 /v This song is so amazing! One of my absolute favourites. /v Yes!! I saw them live last Thursday and they played the music video along with the song. Definitely one of my favorites from the live show. /v I love when he looks ahead with his big eyes  /v Disappointing that these are the singles. Best songs on the album are you move, no more and fail. /v love. I can't believe I'm finally going to see them in concert in two weeks after 35 years! /v Simply the best, they continue to make great, relevant and beautiful music!! /v WHAT A SPACE ODDITY OF DM... \nWELCOME TO REST IN SOCHI /v Is this the second or the third single? Going backwards counts like a single too? /v Excellent! Thank you Depeche Mode... Still entertaining me, as you have since the early 80's. /v The best band ever...\nIconic video!!\n /v I feel like this is a song where I endure the first half to revel in the glory of the second half. /v Ok. Dave is a Cosmonaut (the flag in the chest), but the suit is american and the ship is Gemini (american too). Is a metafhor ? He is a worker, and the suit and ship would be the an analogy for  exploration? /v I love this video. I might be wrong but since i saw this during the global spirit tour, i'm sure somehow there's a tribute to David Bowie here. Ground control to major tom... Thank you Anton, thank you Depeche  /v I cannot explain what I feel when I listen to DM. It takes me to another dimension. It is music for my soul. Pure talent, pure music, pure sound. /v Depeche Mode, Flag of USSR and open space is like a presage of unknown /v Best Depeche Mode video since Enjoy The Silence. /v The video was from the screen on the tour great video /v I absolutely adore DM. It is just such an amazing band, i love them. They are anything but mainstream. All my friends (I am 14) listen to Pop, just because everybody else does it. You can discover so amazing bands. Like Depeche Mode. I don't know about the others here, but I discovered DM through old vinyls of my dad. But because I wasn't able to hear them I headed over to YT. I couldn't stop listening to it. A while ago I went with my dad to their concert and it was my best experience ever... /v the best single and video of Spirit. /v There's 61 people with no any taste of music whatsoever...shame on u lot...this is just a masterpiece /v 3 great singles in a row, great album. /v He taught me music is nothing without raw emotion and depth. Love you David.. /v That astronaut suit is absolutely stunning and so are the gloves! Perfection is in the details <3 /v The best band of the World!!! /v Mr Gahan looks a bit like sir Ben Kingsley /v I can't explain how I love this band!!!  /v       ,       /v    ,  /v  ?  ?  ?     ...  .   . /v Top!!! /v spooky sediment /v   !!!! /v Love it! /v Martin nerede lan /v Cad os brasileiros daqui? /v Master piece  /v genial! blanco y negro /v Hermosa cancin :) /v So fucking amazing /v Good song, bad video. /v THIS-THIS IS GREAT WOW /v AWESOME .... CHILE SEE YOU !!!!!!!! /v i love forever DM <3 /v No estoy llorando, no vale. /v This is great. /v So DM are communist.... hummmm /v Cover Me, ma tuerie.... Merci /v Dave Gahan es un astronauta sovitico. Hell yeah! /v Bellisimo Dave+Anton !!! /v Simply Superstar!!!! /v i like /v loooooove /v  /v Magnifique /v 45 243 zhlednuti 4 tisice liku 308 259 odberatelu 457 komentaru a 54 disliku /v   /v This kinda sucks /v DM...I LOVE YOU!!! /v  /v Very Good! /v great song /v  /v So Good! /v Dave looks bored AF /v Te amo Dave /v  /v HO I BRIVIDI COMUNQUE. POESIA. /v Cette chanson est l incarnation du son DM...elle aurait pu etre une de Violator!! Les frissons..ca m embarque loin dans la DMsphere...terrible! /v DM...LA MEJOR BANDA DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS!!! SON LO MS! ARGENTINA LOS ESPERA  /v Encantada... La.mejor rola del.disco..... Y el vdeo.... Ahhhhh de otro mundo..... Saludos desde Mxico /v Se nota la mano de Anton, otro nivel /v Justamente mi favorita del album  /v Es demasiado sueo perfecto, ver a Dave convertido en astronauta.  /v Y este es del regalo de cumpleaos de parte de mis dolos! /v Anton Corbijn, the 5th member of Depeche Mode. /v Il pezzo migliore dell'album. Grande Dave. /v 2:47 Irma is that you ? /v Nope.....this album still sucks.  I will have every DM album in my collection but this one. /v This album is actually pretty good. First good one in a long time. /v What a vdeo DM /v If they make another Taken movie, they should call it, Taken 4 Granted. Turns out, he had a long lost son name Grant and the first 3 Taken movies were his dreams. His dad is actually a drunken jerk, knows no kung fu and isn't a spy or whatever. /v Trying to think of a good Liam Neeson joke, but they're all taken /v isn't this just that movie non stop but instead of a plane, its on a train? Well played then /v I create video game music~please listen my track~thanks /v That's how you do a good trailer for a movie full of good actors . /v 1st an aeroplane now a train .... what's next!? /v How many commutes does liam need to get to his destination? He's been on a plane now a train. /v I will never ride with this guy! /v Liam Neesom looks so frail in that thumbnail. It's a damn shame /v Don't ever mess with Liam Neeson! He will FOOK you up! /v Liam, and I'm there /v dont tell me SOME ONE GETS KIDNAPPED AGAIN!!! /v It's like that movie where he was on the plane. Now he is on a train. /v But if you touch her... /v Non stop on a train /v The shallows. What a terrible movie. I have a feeling this will be bad. /v Its just Norma messing with another guy's mind /v Just don't kill him when you find him /v not you again Liam Neeson ffs! /v I adore Vera farmiga .. /v Liam Neason stars in... Removed (bwaaaah) /v Negative comment. /v New taken looks goooood /v norman got too her /v Non-stop 2? /v Who here just because vera farmigas in it /v Looks great....I just love movies like these. /v The real cliffhanger here is.. will Liam Neesons fight wolves with bare hands in this one? /v Can someone explain that ? Is that copy of None Stop or sequel of None Stop ? /v I don't know who you are, but i will find you, and i will kill you Lorraine Warren! /v Did anyone notice the Terminator tune at 01:19? /v About bloody time. I've been waiting for this trailer since the movie was announced nearly a year ago. /v Another film about Liam Neeson having problems with public transport. He should learn to drive. /v They need to do a Liam Neeson movie that doesn't have Liam Neeson in it /v WOAH WOAH.....Tommen? In modern? I'm probably on that weird side of youtube again? /v So he kills again? /v didn't he already do this on a plane? /v At the end of the movie his alarm goes off and he wakes up the end /v wow a trailer that doesn't give away the whole movie! /v This could be either really good or really bad.. /v I love Qui-Gon Jinn, but ole soy sauce head is like 78. Isn't he getting too old for action movies. /v liam neeson kills people on a train the movie /v Okay so obviously this takes place after they have kidnapped his daughter then his wife. As you can see because this must be his second marriage. Where I'm confused though, does this take place before working for the Irish Mob and working in Alaska or after?? /v First he was set up in a plane, now in a train, so next should be a boat or did I miss that one XD /v If i was Liam i would GTFO of there. /v And here I was thinking she just wanted to bang him.... /v if its liam neeson i always accept /v Surprised that nobody got taken in this trailer.... /v finally some old school action thriller !! /v if Vera is here where's Patrick huh? /v I'm still excited as long Liam Nesson on the movie, even this movie looks like a Non-Stop /v From the director of The Shallows and Non-Stop.\n\nSOLD  /v What is up with Liam Neeson with CellPhones and setting up stuff. /v Couldn't happen in the UK. If you tried to start a conversation with a stranger, they'd look at you like you're insane and slowly edge away. /v Taken 10: The Commuter Edition. /v So Liam Neeson always gets bad luck every time he takes public transport. /v Finally! was wondering when Taken 4 comes out.. /v It is Liam Neeson...he will find you /v Is it the Trailer for The Commuter Teaser, OR the Teaser Trailer for The Commuter? /v For a moment I thought that he'll say: I will find you and I will kill you /v 75K??? ill do it for 5k /v Poor Liam.  Lets hope he never gets on the same bus with Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves. /v Give it a rest. /v lol just dont take the money and movie is over and happy ending.... /v Looks like the guy from Non Stop got cleaned up and had a couple of kids and then....got himself in to some similar mess. Liam Neeson just can't catch a break... /v Maybe this is the best trailer of this year. Let's hope the movie is as good. /v the commutaken /v taken /v Here comes the Taken jokes XDDD /v looks great /v This is his last movie. Will definitely watch it. /v Yeah.. I'll watch anything that Liam Neeson is in. /v The king of action thriller is back baby!  /v i almost thought than this is his non-stop sequel  ...... /v This is pretty much just another Source Code movie /v Non stop : train edition /v He looks tinner /v The Taken Commuter. /v excellent trailer /v Rainy day thriller /v Non-Stop 2 /v Liam Neeson in: That escalated quickly /v loooool yep he owns this genre now. /v Woa hdude they do trailers 6 months before movies come out now? /v Non-stop 2 /v Non stop: Train edition /v Liam nesson looks looks olds /v Wow.. /v Source Code 2: Taken /v Norma isnt dead!!!! L /v 13 Sins? /v Taken in conjuring /v Kinda reminds me of Source Code /v Yay Norma lives!!  /v Hasn't he done this movie already? Then called Non-Stop. /v Calling it now.... the identity of the passenger he's trying to uncover.... will be himself. /v Non - stop part 2! /v Can we say no to a movie with VERA FARMIGA??? /v Kind of looks like the movie Source Code. /v I see Liam, I upvote! /v Wow, Apairo is a piece of shit. /v You mentioned the cameras, Joe was not in anyway aware of that until after the fact so including that on his record is unfair at best and defamatory at worst. Again, you attribute the bad behavior of the prison workers entirely to him, even though he was not involved in the beating or informed until afterwards. Thats like a Mc Donalds employee killing someone and the CEO of Mc Donalds being called a culprit, but you no doubt are aware of that testimony not having evidence to support it. They didn't have footage, much of her story didn't match up to what they saw when investigating, and that is why nobody was convicted. That 171 number that you cited, were not american citizens. They were illegal immigrants, and that was their crime. (Illegal immigration) all 171 of them. /v Don't tell me that with internet access in this day and age, most people are still clueless that Jews control media, banking, politics. Please don't tell me that most people have no idea that for decades Jews have been working feverishly to undermine Whites, Christianity, and nation-states for a single global police-state via wars, massive non-White immigration, feminism, free speech and gun bans, political correctness, gay rights, hate crime laws, affirmative action, free trade agreements, bank bailouts. Please don't tell me I'm racist for stating facts. /v John Oliver lives in a white gated community far from the people he claims to adore. /v You realize the pardon is just for the case brought against him right? It has nothing to do with the rest of his life. /v I am  very like your show thank you /v I know HBO has some low standards but damn.\nAt this point porn is less offensive. /v ...So, when are we getting the Pope Francis special? He's adorable... /v Wait, what law did he break!? /v As an Arizonan who lives in Maricopa county, I can tell you that we were all so fucking happy to see him gone and jailed. And then, like he does with everything, Trump had to go and fuck it up. /v kinda makes sense for trump to pardon a man who closes his eyes and sticks his fingers in his ears when sexual assault is brought up. This truly is the golden age of america /v Goddamn, what a fascist Cunt. If I were ever a victim of hishorseshit jail, I would absolutely be inclined to becomehispersonal Taxi Driver. /v Everything he says is bullshit. Do not listen to him. Hes a liar. /v Arpaio is the gutter of humanity pardoned by the recesses of the sewer of humanity Donald Motherfuckin Trump! This country has been flushed down the toilet. /v I'm already depressed; why is my country falling to shit?  /v Wow this guys is a a**hole. I real f**king a**hole. The world is officially falling apart, not like that's news to anyone... /v Is it me or is John starting to look hot. /v Even John Oliver can't make all this shit less depressing /v I think it's important to say he isn't Sheriff anymore we voted him out 65-35 in November /v Read this: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/crimes-felonies-misdemeanors-infractions-classification-33814.html\n\nInfractions CANNOT be punished with jail time. CANNOT. Joe Arpaio violated the law here! Dumb old russet potato without a life ... /v Is... is Arpaio gay...? Like the pink underwear, that seems like some supressed homosexual urges manifesting. /v That Joe dude looks a little Spergy, which is an insult to people with Aspergers all around the world... /v How can you determine whether or not the people arrested for being in the country illegally were suspected due to their race or not?  That just sounds like a loophole for illegal immigrants to try to use to have the case thrown out. /v Yes, but do they got a milk? /v Why is this liberal mouthpiece showing up in my recommended feed? I am not a sheep. I think for myself thank you. /v Well said, as always. However this time we should all be left with a chill and deep concern for the welfare of every marginalized and underprivileged group of fellow Americans. White silence is murder. /v I'm not a fan of Sheriff Joe but compared to some of the folks that Clinton pardoned he's a boy scout. /v There is a special place in Hades for that man; the former sheriff is beyond scum. /v This got some serious OJ Simpson flair to it... /v By law, what is needed to overrule a persidential pardon? Surely it has some limitations and is not the highest legal entity (I hope. I really don't want to lose even more faith in humanity). /v We need to charge Joe Arpaio with war crimes or something... Can't we do that? ... damn it, how come he's not in Nuremberg, already? \n\nI genuinely don't understand how he hasn't be charged for multiple murders, sexual assaults, and physical assaults, assaults with a deadly weapon... I'm from Maricopa County. I KNOW exactly what kind of bastard he is. \n\nYes, his nickname IS HITLER. No, It's not a joke, and it's not random chance. I can say Hitler and people generally know who I am referring to if they knew anything about Joe. Tent city was a concentration camp. Thank your diety of choice that I can say was a concentration camp. /v As long as racist Caucasian people are in charge of this country nothing will ever change. Il just say.. If Rome can fall  so can America /v It is unworthy to knock Arpaio because he isn't fluently captivating.  The rest of accounts of Arpaio are worthy enough. /v Yeah let's go hand to hand buddy see how fucking tough you are /v He is weird /v #pornmatters /v FINALLY SUBTITLES /v That's scary /v I agree 100%, Sheriff Arpaio should not have been pardoned and should have gone to one of his own jails.  \n\nBut where were you, Mr. Oliver, when President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera?  As bad as Sheriff Arpaio was, and I think his deliberate malfeasance killed people, he wasn't in the same league as Mr. Rivera.  Among other felonies, he was the head bombmaker for a terror group, the FALN, that claimed credit for 120 bomb attacks, killing six and injuring dozens.  There are parallels: as with Sheriff Arpaio, Mr. Rivera was unrepentant and as with President Trump's pardon, President Obama's commutation was popular with a slice of his constituency. /v Quick fact check....the record for highest temp in AZ is 128 degrees in 1994. Not 145 like in the video. /v Wait john that story is false his white privilege stopped them form beating him to death ....cops dont hurt white people or white privilege wouldnt exist they need to fire this closet white supremacist and get a true black man up in there #supporteryourlocalantifa /v Hey l would appreciate if you followed my account if you are interested in minimalistic and aesthetics fotos@z.e.serin /v Sad I can only dislike once /v He's the kind of guy that visits whores because his wife is so Christian she would not suck his dick, telling it's evil. Yet arrests said prostitutes later on because they committed a crime. Double standards. /v He pardoned a man backing federal laws... Dumbama and Clinton pardoned drug dealing MURDERS AND TERRORISTS!! /v Oliver can legally run for a U.S. senate seat, if he is a naturalized citizen. Please move to Kentucky and help us #ditchmitch. Thank you. /v John oliver, you're a high-maintenance little flower cuck!  Just kidding, doing my best standard youtube commenter impression /v The USA is not a racist country, it has a president with down syndrome even... /v When I have a child I'll tell them that I survived this shit show of a president. /v I love this. This limey douche bag talking about the politicization of his office? Really??? What about the cocksucking Obama? \n\nNot that sucking dick is wrong. He should just own up to it. /v If Justice Anthony Kennedy retires, will DTrump fill the seat with, Lord love a duck, Joe Arpaio?     #shudder /v I still dont know why LastWeek Tonights videos get dislikes. Be a hardline idiot but youre still gonna laugh at the show. If not Mr. Oivers jokes /v Didn't watch, down voted the video. :^) /v Are you insane?\n If Sheriff Arpaio had used Hitlerian rhetoric in his rallies he would've been exposed years ago. It's easy to label him a racist when you have the Leftist propaganda machine (in print, tv and cable news) backing you. Oliver's a glib dunce that never has to answer any of his verbal diarrhea because it's under the rubric of Comedy.\nEnjoy your pabulum. /v This tv show became trump witch hunt tube... and frankly, boring. /v Does anyone else lose faith in humanity everyday? I think we are doomed. /v Let's see how tough this racist old fuck is when released among the inmates in his own tent city. He would shit his geriatric diapers before even getting there. Toughest Sheriff... please. May Arpaio rot in prison. Criminal scumbag. /v How the fuck is this video trending? /v Excuse me if I don't believe anything this corporate puppet says anymore.\nI think RazrFist is a much more trustworthy source.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CWeP3pS2HM /v And Trump's zealots will *still* defend him over this. There's no arguing with people who actively refuse to use critical thinking. /v There's Dragonstone in the background! /v Rename the damn show already Trump week tonight Getting very monotone and boring. /v Go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You will definately get the only one 100% working secret completely FREE for this game. /v I'm a disgusting man. Even Melania hates me. Sad. /v I kind of believe that the next video might be about the German election on the 24th of September. /v A bunch of spam-bots are terrorizing almost every normal comment on this video. For shame. /v Oops didn't know this was the LIBTARD channel. Can't wait for the SHTF you FUCKERS are all going to DIE!!! /v Got fans anyone notice dragonstone in the background skyline /v Well, that's fascism for you: charge only those people who against you or just can't fight back, don't charge crime lords, pedophiles or rich people because corporativism is key to fascism, abuse women as much as possible, especially if they are underage (because traditional values includes incest and child brides).\n\nAnd yeah, Mussolini was tolerast. He wasn't nationalist, he always said nation isn't ethnicity, but humility and determination - exactly what republicans say today. /v Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg /v Shouldn't it just be illegal to pardon your buddies from the campaign trail? I mean that seems like a huge abuse of power. /v just a friendly reminder that john oliver sucks asshttps://soundcloud.com/666satx/visions-of-color-audiozine-ep7-the-cutting-edge-of-liberation /v On psychologist wrap thin different forest extensive character bite occasionally. /v John  Oliver's a Racist Scum. /v if conservatives are so keen on upholding the constitution and all american rights, they seem pretty quick to throw them out the window if it satisfies their need for putting other people down. /v If Donald Trump meant Job in a biblical sense... he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about he's just spouting words he is allowed to say on camera... /v Don't you people get it now? Legal , illegal only applies to certain people. /v I am sargent 0 fucks given /v WTF /v Scumbag asshole /v 4k dislikes? Fucking assholes /v Holy shitsnacks! /v but her emails /v Now I hate trump lol /v What a fucking disgrace. /v fuckyou Joe Arpayo & DonLd trump, you two Gays /v God bless Joe. Attacked for exposing the fraud that was obama. Sorry clownfish, you can't ignore the evidence. /v Who is this MORON John Oliver? Never heard of him, What 3rd world country does this ass hat come from? No body gives a shit about this MORON Oliver, He should STFU especially about some one as honest as Sheriff Joe. /v This barely scratches the surface of corruption, cruelty and abuse of his office. I'm surprised Oliver didn't warn about the door left wide open for the Russia investigation. If Arpaio gets an instant pardon for his political and ideological fuckery, anyone who doesn't want to testify in the Russia investigation cannot realistically be threatened with contempt of court and appropriately jailed because Trump will just let them off the hook, which is by definition obstruction of justice; the exact reason this investigation is taking place. /v Is this a liberal cesspool? /v John Oliver, you beautiful bastard! Y'all finally got subtitles!!!  /v I want to know, who are the dicks down voting this. /v John Oliver, the nerdier, gayer, and equally as unfunny as his leftist liberal cuck of a brother Stephen Colbert. #Hillary2020 /v Oh America, why don't you do everyone a favor and play with some nukes so we can be rid of you.\nPeople like this are in jail or worse in civilized countries.... /v Hi I'm john Oliver. I get paid to sit on my ass and be a pretentious douche, judging everything in the world that has purpose except for my sorry ass. Sure feels good to be rich and living in a bubble. /v you know until Obama was president, the White house was truely a 'white house' /v **Liberal propaganda** /v Did this dipshit ever talk about Chelsea manning or the Puerto Rican bomber getting pardoned by OBOZO? I'm waiting /v John you whiny baby typical of liberal tards, this guy stands up for the law and in typical left anarchist fashion you climb on him, why not sit and go through all the lovely characters your god obama pardoned you idiot. /v There is more important issues roaming around your English Arse , like Rohingya Ethnic Cleansing in Fucking Myanmar, me old mate . /v What is this.

Glad to see it was minimal. /v So basically nothing then? /v This is pocket change for Disney. /v Once night crews have a longer chance to clean up it will be back to normal. /v I know this sounds stupid, but I really hope Disney replaces those big trees (in the first minute of the video) Magic Kingdom lacks foliage and needs all the greenery it can get /v It looked like the rest of the park (beside a few tall trees) was pretty much locked down and fairly hurricane proof. Not that much other damage that I could see. /v Its just the trees not anything eles /v Y'all the best time to go to Disney World is pre and post hurricane. Ghost town pretty much. If only hurricanes comes on schedule so that I can plan my trip. Joke /v I hate to see all of those beautiful trees and landscaping destroyed. Disney has the greatest grounds keeping staff and I'm sure they'll have it all back in shape in no time. I know that it's not the most important thing considering all of deviation, homes lost, property loss, lives shattered and lives lost. I just feel that picking ourselves up and putting things back together is the best way to heal. At WDW repairing the landscaping is a great start. /v Glad to see that the castle is still standing. :) /v Wow....a few trees knocked over. /v Looks like trees were the biggest victims /v Looks like they got lucky then. /v That is not that much of damage at Magic Kingdom Epcot Animal Kingdom /v Damn /v they'll clean this up in under a week, watch /v Nothing drastic.... See Ya Real Soon Mickey and Co.  On our way Sept 19th  Woo Hoo /v I am happy for you guys of the hurricane Irma /v Hi, the part where you filmed splash mountain did the hurricane suck out  all that water from splah mountain?  /v This is an asmr voice if I ever heard one /v What do I do when I am sad?I watch a youtube video...on my phone. /v Start from unsubscribe and stop watching YouTube /v Even this video is being watched on the phone by millions /v I watched this on my iPhone. /v Television .... newspapers.... knowledge.... humans have a constant desire for it.  There ya go! Have a nice day ! /v I'm in Florida and just had hurricane Irma pass over us. I been without internet for about 4 to 5 days and it has been of my worst days in many recent years. I've come to realize how much I'm attached to this device. /v I think you have something of a point here, but it doesn't apply universally. I sit with my thoughts alone all the time and yet I also use my phone a lot. I'm constantly self-reflecting and this isn't impaired by my phone usage. /v Our phones and immediate connection to all those around us have revolutionized our culture. Granted, this myopic generalized self commentary on how you perceive people is well done and calming but it's redundant and ironic. The fact that I can stay connected to everyone I know albeit through a device is extremely comforting. Of course we're isolated in our worlds, that's always been the case, but imagine how isolating it would be if you couldn't contact someone when you needed to?  \nKeep making videos guys! /v The people's heads look like golf clubs. I don't like that. /v Right on time of the X. /v Deep philosophy. I love how this video gives people the perspective they need /v When you look back in your life and remember the happiest moments, do they all have something in common? I thought that probably for most of us,  those were the moments where we felt totally absorbed in something we loved to do, to a point where we forgot about time and about ourselves and everything around ..Like when you get lost in a book, in a piece of music you play or when you feel one with the nature. Or when you get into a deep conversation with a friend, watch a great movie or  a concert...  You get into a kind of flow. \n\nI don't have a smart phone, because I thought it would constantly bring me back to the surface.  And surface is absolutely the place where you suffer the most! Imagine all the situations I described above: A phone that makes strange noises at any unexpected moment would ruin it all. \n\nWell I don't mean to offend anyone, this is just a personal thing and I confess that I have a total  obsession with silence and my phone is turned off 99 percent of the time. \n\nBut here is a quote by Nietzsche that is worth keeping ALWAYS  in mind: \n\nThe greatest events  of our lives - they are not our loudest but our stillest hours\n\n Imagine that you have your favourite cake in front of you. But if you get lost in some thoughts while eating it, you may suddenly realise that the cake is gone!  You just ate it without even noticing it! ( It happened to me more than once with all sorts of muffins! :- ) \n\n If we spend our counted days on earth with constant distraction, in the end,  we may feel this way about our lives  ... We won't know where it  has gone...\n\nAs T. S. Eliot said: \n\nWe get  distracted from distraction by distraction. \n\nThat's the greatest danger.\n\nI don't mean to sound too dark though. Of course you can have the latest smart phone, in case you REALLY need it, and if you know exactly what you want from it, you can use it properly.\n\nFor friends who want to think more on this issue here is a little list: \n\n1. There is a TED Talk by Adam Alter called: \n\n Why our screens make us less happy. \n\n He is a psychologist and professor at NYU and he says that he himself was \naddicted to his phone and to gaming. Imagine! :- ) That motivated him to write the following book: \n\n Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and The Business of \nKeeping Us Hooked. \n\n2. There is a very interesting  Note to Self podcast episode called: \n\n What is our attention actually worth \n\nIt can be helpful if you want to re-think your relationship with your phone. \n\n3. There is a TED Talk by the  ethical design thinker Tristan Harris called: \n\nHow better tech could protect us from distraction\n\n4.  I haven't read this one but Shery Turkle from MIT has a book on the issue called:\n\n Alone Together, Why we expect more from Techonology and Less From Each Other. \n\nYou can also watch her TED talk:\n\n Connected, but alone ?\n\nThanks for this wonderful lesson and for the amazing animation! /v My phone broke for about three days recently and it was bliss without it, I was actually a little sad when my Dad fixed it for me /v FINALLY: please, listen what a philosopher said to us!!!!! NOW /v 3:17 studying frame perfect shine out of shield in the 20xx handbook /v Everything has their own negative sides, even love. But its not their fault that they have those things, its your fault for not thinking outside of the box. /v I've never owned a smartphone and I regularly abandon my dumbphone for weeks when I don't need it at work /v Finaly you stoped talking about love and relationships, i was tired of those topics.....sorry for my awful English. /v This was a beautiful video. Honestly, the animations and the writing are both brilliant in their own ways. I feel like the animator and writer/speaker are two (or three!) different people, because there is a different voice to each of them. Does that make sense? /v The Phone and new tech destroyed my generation /v I like the example this video sets for us. Because it is not the object which is the villain nor the hero, but it is rather a constant reminder that our life is full of choices that we should always reflect on to determine how much to invest in something for there will be either a return or a loss for all of our investments. It is not recommended that we just go with the flow, for then how would we know if we are going in the right direction in the first place if we had only reflected on what was to come of it all. /v This is actually very true.\nI use my smartphone constantly, when alone, avoiding my own thoughts. Perhaps missing out on moments of enlightening reflection and creative thoughts. /v i love how people need to blame something for their inherent shortcomings. its not the phones fault you do stupid things, its your fault for being controlled by it. seems like people who blame guns for killing people instead of blaming people for killing people were the brains behind the concept of this video. /v a hundred years from now they will say how asinine /v Im not addicted to games, i just want to forget about the painful past /v Thumbs up If you're going to watch porn now /v It is all a matter of how we deal with our phones. We should choose to check our phones and not feel compelled to do it. /v I think in the future we will(or should) have classes in school that teach kids the pitfalls of technology and how to stay balanced with one's self in the information age.\nI for one make an active effort to keep balance in my life, even though I love technology and actually work with computers and phones(or maybe because of it). But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy. /v 3:52 I bet you my life you didn't notice that double and in the translation.  /v Anyone ever been to Lyon here ?! :) /v I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple.. /v That was a load of pseudo-intellectual babble.. Far below the standards I've gotten to used to expecting from this channel. \nShame. /v i managed to watch 1/3 of this before checking my email /v This video sounds warm and believable, but in fact, it is wrong.\n\nBecause the problem is not with our phones, instead, it's with us.\n\nIt is like saying the problem with knifes: then, you say that it kill. While it does not kill, but it can be used to kill, also, it can be used for many purposes. /v Oh the irony since I'm watching this on my phone, probably more than 2/3rds or the comment section. /v 1:10 - Scary how this described my current problem at the moment. /v Tl;dr: get off your phone because it's apparently blocking us from some kind of utopian future even though most of you are watching this on your phone\n\n\n\nI don't get it /v I'm having a hard time putting my finger on this one but something about the videos produced by these guys rubs me the wrong but I can not seem to articulate it. But, I am getting the sense that I'm being preached to and I feel that many of the ideas that are being asserted should be debated. Perhaps that is the point of the videos..... at least I hope that is. /v Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access. Or it can be used as a crutch where you can't even think for yourself and rely on social media as a way to feel apart of something. We can't blame the corporations for profiting off the ignorance of the masses, thats just how human nature is. Its the job of people to elevate their own consciousness to become self aware enough to determine a life they want to live. /v Watching this sitting on the toilet taking a dump and reading the comments. :O /v I don't see anything wrong with that. And I watching this video with my phone. Knowledge is the biggest enemy of the scammers /v Same thing as blaming the gun for the murder.  The phone isn't the problem, you are.  If you decide to use your phone to look at pornography all day, that's your choice.  If you decide to use your phone to connect with your grandmother thousands of miles away, that's your choice.  If you can't learn to use the tool you have in your pocket in moderation, that's your choice. /v Used my phone to watch this video for entertainment at work /v Im not that enchanted by smartphones, it's a luxury of a minority who thinks they are the majority, like internet users. /v If you're going to argue that phones are bad, at least provide cited facts rather than observations and anecdotes. There's no shortage of studies observing negative consequences of cell phones (difficulty sleeping, attention, etc). But the way this video presents the argument, it just comes across as pompous. If YouTube were around 150 years ago you would be making a video on how the radio distracts us from our own death. 300 years ago, the newspaper, etc. /v truly amazing content!!  keep up the good work.  such a good reminder of what really matters. /v Nice story, far from reality. /v Even the comments are foolish for such an amazing video. Idiots /v I don't personally feel addicted to my phone and will happily walk home on an evening and just enjoy the scenery and my own thoughts, HOWEVER, when I think about something I admit that I DO whip my phone out and look up the questions I'm thinking about. /v 415 people are unable to accept the truth of their reality. /v You're pathetic if u can't go a few days w/o a phone /v I don't use my phone to run away from myself, I use it so I don't have to interact with others lol /v Very nice message & some awesome animation & narration to go a long with it. Yeah this is a topic I think about a lot. In fact I made a little satire series called Strange Stories to kind of poke fun at how we function with all this advanced technology now. /v I love that this is posted on the day iPhone X's premiere was released. XD /v Enjoy your freedom of thought before our phones literally become a part of us. I can see it now, silent obedience with just the snap of a finger. /v Well I wouldn't have seen this without my phone just saying  /v You say that like it's a bad thing... \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v I'm so obsessed with my phone lol /v looks like the eraser head baby all grown up at 2:05 /v The problem with your phone is it's an iPhone /v Soooo.... what your saying is....\n\n\n\n\nwho is getting the iPhone X? :D /v Is it just me or was that thought super cute /v I stay on my phone when I'm bored then they mobile is invented to make me unbored in home if that's a word  /v The problem with our phones: It gained intelligence but we lost ourselves. /v I have no friends /v Aha! Releasing this on the same day the iPhone X/8 were announced? You dogs! /v this is an amazing video, the animation is great and you actually say some interesting things.\n\nmemento mori /v problem isn't with phones but with ourselves. \nlike hello....move your ass a little around!! /v We spend too much time with our phones, why we should talk to other people in real life, if we could spent our whole life to stare on our phone? (I'm guilty too in this case, so please don't judge me!) ^^ /v capitalism and materialism are the problems /v My break from my phone is photography... granted, I listen to music via my phone, but at least I'm not still staring at it... and fuck off if you say my cameras a screen, I spend much more time looking around and through the view finder than at the screen /v why did this video take such a dark turn... didnt expect a video about phones to be so morbid /v can you the same things for books, youtube, knowledgable video ? plz explain . . . where the scattered knowledge come from . . . what is the right path to become knowledgable without addiction /v This guy's voice haha what the fuck /v aka a tree hugger's guide to phones /v PS Beautiful animation! /v E /v Quality. /v Irony = watching this video on my iPhone  /v *watches on phone* /v Nice /v . /v ... this is absolutely ignorant. /v Black Mirror /v That was deep /v Truth hurts. /v Anxiety /v 3:16\n*The Year is 20xx* /v Wow.... /v Open up a patreon.com /v Dat tongue at 4:05 /v capitalists /v Lel I use my phone cuz I'm bored /v Delete them unnecessary applications  /v 0:30  Yoooooo Fuck this shit. Please! Please. Don't think this is your own self. Sitting in a room letting your thoughts flow to simultaneously the past and future, feeling at the same time pain, desire, regret and excitement all at the same time. The Mean is to be in a room just watching. Being in the moment not pretending your in the past or future. I mean why were those emotions chosen? every emotion is surely a part of life but thoughts of desire, pain and regret do not seem great to me. It's videos like this that let me know some part of the world wants to lead somewhere sad. /v They don''t keep a charge for more than 2 hours. Thats the problem with our phones. /v fuck yo capitalism /v What a fucking human we all are becoming.... /v No, fuck this phone lol. I'm ready to throw this one in the crick. If the internet were to die tomorrow, I'd get my dreams back. When's the last time you dreamt, people? /v Drive the Lexus LC-F! I've actually been considering buying that car! /v You must not have seen the rc F /v You would never know to do that unless you watch this video or you could read the owners manual /v DO A VIDEO ABOUT MAYBACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v muricans.... are the only shills that can drive a better quality car than a bentley... and complain it cost 100k.... because its japanese??? meanwhile the japan cars manufacturers are the reason their cars went bankrupt, so somebody bought them... and like them... this car is really cheap , its a fine V8 with amazing quality and tech, plenty of extras for only 100k /v They should have used the v10 from the LFA /v This guy talk so fast he look high on cocaine /v Doug I'm sorry but it looks like you shit your pants all the time /v The LFA's new little brother /v The editing in this video isn't very good. Very harsh cuts. /v As a valet, it was really funny listening to Doug geeking out over features I see as standard all the time xD /v Needs some sort of power adder for that v8... /v Doug is the type of guy to sit on a toilet with the lid up and call it sport mode /v Put on some Toyota badges and sell it as new supra /v Is Lexus a different division, or still Toyota? /v All Lexus is an expensive Toyota product What we have is a 100,000 Avalon Coupe /v Great review Doug. I am one of your faithful fans. /v Exterior ugly af interior looks like a Toyota Sienna /v He's 29 but looks 40 /v The real question is, would to you pay over 100k for a camry coupe /v I would absolutely buy this car. In fact, this seems like one I hope to buy one day. For now, just cruisin' in my '07 ES 350. /v Acts like 100k is a lot for a Lexus sports car, like the exhaust sounds crazy for a Lexus, like the interior is too nice for Lexus, YET forgets that the LFA exists and costs 4 times as much, sounds just as (if not more) amazing than the LC500, and has a beautiful interior/exterior. /v OMG, this guy is annoying. How can anyone listen to his babbling for 20 min? /v These things look like legit road going concepts /v All I can think about are all of those little features breaking within 50k miles. /v What happens if someone spills coffee on that touch pad? I could see that happen a lot by owners across the world /v The door handles suck @ 12:02.  Why too clumsy steps where most cars just have a grab handle you pull? /v I'm still not seeing why you should buy the lc500 over the rcf, with the same powertrain and over a 30k difference, you're better off with the rc unless you're just trying to make a statement. After all, the lc does look good. /v Poorly designed cup holder. They need to address that. It would be a daily peeve for any coffee drinker or milk shake lover. /v Park this LC500 next to a Vantage and I'd want the Vantage, but the LC looks good and sounds good enough, great even, that I wouldn't mind the savings now and during ownership. /v bicycle t-shirt - exact opposite transport segment of the car he's reviewing..\n\nthat Lexus grille is the ugliest gaping thing on a car since...can't think of one uglier. /v Couldn't imagine paying that much for a car with only 400hp. For that price you could get a GT350R, or a ZL1 and still have money left for mods. /v Did Doug forget about the LFA already? 15:49  It feels more like a true sports car than any Lexus I've ever driven! /v Doug the type of guy to cut himself off. /v If you want to know what it's like to drive a $25,000 luxury Lexus sports coupe, just wait about 3 years or 40k miles and drive this piece of spectacularly depreciating shit. /v I feel like a saw carbon fiber in the doors. /v Im sorry bud, this was poorly edited. /v Looks ok,except for that sewer grate ugly grill and bunch o stupid gizmos,and why ten speed trany?it will be always up and downshifting.. /v He is treating Lexus as it is like Hyundai's Genesis Brand.. Lexus has been established luxury brand since more than 30 years ago... HELLOOOO.... /v I didn't even know this thing existed. I thought this was their supercar with the V10. /v so now i cant hit and run pedestrians anymore?? fuck /v Sounds like a salesman he must like this car definitely not my cup of tea. /v Performance drivers don't give a rat's ass about cup holders!! Nonetheless, this is definitely a beautiful car. However, for the money I'll have to go Porsche. Great job though, Lexus!!!!! /v I'd take a benz any day cuz I don't wanna be a weird fricken lexus owner /v At 55K I'd buy it at a heart beat /v Suburban regularly president over locate live. /v I only come for the tour and quirks...  don't really care how any of these cars drive. /v Damn, this reviewer makes the car seems lame  /v 2018 Lexus LFA, I see so many similarities other than the ones Doug said and I love it. /v That 0-60 time is ass... I've gotten my RAM to hit 5.5, I know quickness isn't everything but for 100,000 there is so many better cars you could get. /v SO, how does this stack up against your Aston Martin?\nLike your shirt! /v ok this is ugly tesla better then this outo pilot. door handles open on there own. it costs less 44 thousand to 100 thousand /v Considering the specs and all, this seems like what is essentially a high end luxury Mustang GT. How is this at all supposed to rival a Porsche. /v Dougs the type of guy that puts the toilet seat down /v 4.6 0-60.... 170 top speed ..... and you compare it to majority of AMGs how? My sub-$40k mustang is quicker and has a top speed 6mph less. /v Damn 100,000 for a Lexus? For 30,000 less you can get a tesla model s! 0-60 in 2.8 337 miles a charge an no more being a slave to gas pumps. TESLA look it up! /v I think Mr. DeMuro provides an excellent viewpoint. I really don't think it matters if he is white or black or yellow or any other color. What I really enjoy about his reviews are his enthusiasm for cars and The fact he doesn't take himself too seriously and seems to truly enjoy what he does. Why watch the review if you don't like it :-). /v Too bad the front grille looks like it came off a Camry /v Oh look, it's got the center console coverfrom the Mazda RX-8. /v Is Doug Jay Leno's son? /v Toyota=lexus  $ for lexus brand? extra twenty thousand equals r8. plus resell value you are better of sticking to gtr or hellcat. /v Doug the type of guy to hold the door when you're 50 feet away /v So if you hit someone, the hood pops up and they land on a hot V8? /v This is better than anything BMW or Mercedes has put out recently. I would buy it over an S-Class coupe in a heartbeat! /v and here I thought my daily CT was cool with the changable tach interface too, lol. jk.\nCool review. /v ok call me crazy or whatever but I have been in many higher end cars, such as a handful of Mercedes AMG's, and I don't see how Doug can say this alcantara is in any way reliable. Last AMG I was in was about a year and a half old and that alcantara was down to nothing on the armrests and steering wheel. I understand it is in places that you are going to be touching a lot but I dont understand how people, especially car manufacturers, think that it will hold up past a year. /v Doug is the kinda guy that rips on a brand new car without breaking it in.. /v As for the price, the LS600h costs even more... /v Doug the type of guy to call a 3 second animation a movie /v Doug we get it - cars of this size aren't for adults to sit in the back. You don't have to climb in the back in everyone and mess up the cars you don't own. /v He talks to damn fast to hear most of the information. /v this car looks like it is 200k not 100k /v Gawd that v8 5.0 sounds amazing! Has a hint of coyote. /v Hey @Dougdemuro. Here you go mate. \nSynonyms for quirk\noddity of personality, way of doing something\naberration characteristic eccentricity foible habit\nLove your work. Greetings from Aus. /v do the US dealer don't care about car's break in period? just let Doug floor the shit out of the Brand new car that cost over 100K then sell it to the customer as a 'Brand New Car'? In Korea, customers get 'Brand New' car with 3km on Odometer. Literally never driven with all the vinyl covers still intact. /v I swear Doug talks a little faster each video /v 10:01 Doug went full country mode for a second /v Talks way too damn fast but he's probably trying to be courteous to the people he borrows from, idk just feels like he's always just trying to sell me something. You also insult a lot of your viewers saying they wouldn't notice some things when they definitely would like the trunk release and lexus engraved screws. If I spend money on anything I usually notice the little details let alone a 100,000 car that is super cool. /v Why the country accent for 1 second at 10:00 haha /v Overpriced for its' capability. /v 11:21 jeez already has swirls *facepalm* /v interior color scheme sucks /v 13:04 window roll dowm /v Jesus that interior is gorgeous /v Man, the Doug score sucks /v Video starts at 17:31 /v when does this guy breathe ? /v Played the quirks drinking game... /v A long coupe prius /v Asmr sports car???? /v why even bother with these cheeseball cars? /v O face at 12:28 /v Anybody see Dougs pubic hair at 6:30? /v SHOW ME THE QUIRKS /v Reminds me of the lfa /v amazing car /v You were going 75MPH ;) /v I LIKE LEXUS. /v Doug, today marks the very first time I have to disagree with something you say, ever. Analog clocks are the best - they bring that elegant, refined look that goes with the rest of the car while bringing an old-school touch to very modern technology. When you really get used to it, reading the time is just as fast and gives you an actual representation of where you are in your day. Of course they're a little less practical but you know, if you want practicality buy a CR-V instead. /v NO! /v . /v You cut your hair /v So Cool /v Why is Derek me? /v Queefa wasn't my fav  /v You should considered calabing with Alex wassbi /v Lol /v Queen /v Plz do part 2!!! /v I subscribed!! /v  /v 6:34 GOT ME LAUGHINFMDKDOS /v Is Tylar her boyfriend?

Oh Maru! /v Too funny! /v  /v Very funny! /v Cube Maru Swish Tail /v So funny /v  /v  /v (--) /v 1:01() /v The first attempt? Noble, but obviously not enough. Then, the artistic spasm, the flip, the roll, the wiggle and finally a butt up tail lashing contortion resembling a confused Slinky. For those of you who've ever wondered what the inside of the Magician's box with the Lady in it looks like after the lid is closed! /v Maru makes me so claustrophobic sometimes! \nLol and even squished in a plastic box, he leaves his tail free to twitch. :) /v It's their normal don't judge! Too hilarious like the odd couple that just accept. Hana just lays by him like, here we go again with the tight spaces /v OMG.. it's sooo adorably dumb. I LOVE YOU MARU. /v How is that comfortable? /v maru .. one of these days, you're gonna get me Claustrophobia ya know..  /v It's like he turned into liquid!

It's just the way I like it! /v Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, we have made this box transparent so we can see the wild Maru in his native environment.... /v Maru looks at Hana wondering why she doesn't want to get in the box. /v Better translation of more fitting feeling would be more comfortable position ;) /v Hana finds the Maru Channel (on Aquarium TV) is boring and she goes to sleep, so that is when something very interesting happens! /v Maru you are one strange cat but I love you for it. <3 /v so exciting and really funny; never seen before this :-). Maru is really a special cat; applause :-) /v Brilliant camera work. You effortlessly and naturally capture Maru's dry wit, and serious commitment to the task at hand. Brava. /v I expected the T-1000 theme to start when Maru was melting. /v This cat is just incredible  /v He is like the Terminator Kitty, he melts into liquid form, then back to Cat form. /v 6 people just here to hit dislike a video of a cat fitting in and finding super comfortable in a fish tank that can make him fall asleep. What's wrong with you people? /v I wonder... what happened to the fish before?? If that's the aquarium, then something happened to the fish?  /v Maru is poetry in motion...slow motion. <3 <3 /v He needs another box to put his tail into /v Maru doesn't care if we think it fits, he just wants to get inside no matter what! /v if this is not proof that cats are in reality liquid, idk what is XD /v Omg!!!

Worked off 5th ave in a diampnd company and would go to Times Square on my lunch break and the world's largest H&M and stroll all 5 floors bc I was bored lol Trust me when I say this: NYC is NOT what ppl cut it out to be lol 4 GREAT reasons: 1. Overpopulated 2. High cost of living 3. Filthy 4. Rudeness. The struggle was real, folks. Although I did make great memories, the only time it's great to go to NYC is TO VISIT. /v Hahaha Bailey say that to her driver?

No one comes to the Father except through me. Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless. /v Why is this propaganda up on YouTube again?

Pinoy,American and maybe Chinese and Spanish  #wilodia /v This is hilarious and kilig at the same time. My feels at wilodia!  /v lels. i could not stop laughing and being excited at he same time. i usually watch you vlogs with my twins boys, they are pretty much excited with your progress and with the Wilodia love story and all the hyperness in very vlog (they are amazed to 'meet' someone as hyper as them haha) but you know what, they aint watching this one haha, they keep on asking when are you going to marry alodia hahaha cause theyd like to meet your kids lmao /v I see you took my advice! Awesome! Here's some more young man... https://www.facebook.com/damianmarley/videos/1608615609177313/?hc_ref=ARS_yus1GOqtqO90L8biBYj4zErC-8V9kwWBXYLJzYqGh_zBxW3SoAKWp1N8m7KZsYU&fref=gs&hc_location=group /v Just curious, you dont need seatbelts in the US? /v SUB TO SUB? SMALL YOUTUBER LANG PO  /v This was your most CREEEPY vid ever, Wil. I can see you taking Alodia with you, but taking your MOTHER and SISTER with you was just weird! And having your sister ask you if you were done jacking off and praising you for doing a good (hand) job gave me the shivers. I mean, do you and your father accompany your sister to her doctor for PAP smear day and praise her for stirrup flexiblity? I did learn something new by your porn selection...you've got a thing for blondes. Haha /v What's that liquid haley had to chug? What's it for? /v I'm loving his supportive family  /v Just saw the new episode im so happy they're still funny and original /v So why did they not make fun of black lives matter? Oh right they are liberals /v Yellow fever Parker & (((Stone))) revealed who they really are politically with lousy season 20, which lets us know which side they'll shit on over Charlottesville, so fuck 'em. But I'll still watch The Cartman Show. /v If this was like last season it would have taken 3 episodes for alexa to go missing. /v Yeah I thought the season premiere was kind of weak tbh.  The country rendition of Kendrick Lamar's Humble was pretty funny, though. /v Matt, Trey...not your best work. I want better for you. /v Cue the outrage police who never actually watched South Park except for a few out of context clips to claim that South Park is literally alt-right fascist propaganda. /v Alright I wonder what Season 21 will look like in the first episode /v Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it. /v i'm gonna be really annoyed if the whole episode focuses on the parents and politics instead of the kids acting like assholes..and if cartman is still politically correct i'm gonna scream /v Only a 10 second preview and I can tell this season if going to be great /v I hope it isn't just more politics and storylines.. Thats what I didn't like about the last season. It got boring really fast. /v All these cucks and pricks. talking about, I HOPE THEY MAKE FUN OF ANTIFA, OHHHH BOY, oh blm is killing ppl, but u choose White nationalist. Wasn't ripping on stupid shit the entire reason season 20 failed. Yeah i thought so /v I hope we're not seeing PC Principal again. And I hope the seasons are longer again /v Fucking excited as fuck for fucking sanity in the era of Antifa and the Alt Right. Fuck everyone. John McAfee 2020! That white stuff is good! Now I'm going to fuck a Thai lady boy. /v Spoiler Alert:\n\n\n\n\nCartman broke up with Heidi!!!! /v It's started /v Derk a Derrrr /v dey tuk err juuuuuuubbbbbbb /v When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now /v The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place. /v 0:05 is that master chief with a confederate flag on his head? /v Despite what the media is saying, I can guarantee you that if they've returned to the good satire they used to do, they're going to attach both sides of this. /v Try and stay away from politics, and I don't even care what biases it is, it's still annoying. And bring back the real cartman /v Day tooker jabbsss /v THEY TEERK ERRR JERBS! /v they took your job /v Why don't you wait and see the full episode instead of assuming you can guess the entire plot of the episode based on 10 seconds of footage. Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story. But if the only reason you hate it is because its satirizing the extreme right, follow the advice you dish out to the extreme left and stop being such a pussycuck. /v Shit like this is why I love South Park /v Would PewDiePie approve? \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v I literally just lost my s*** mr. Hankey where are you when I heard South Park was coming back on right now b**** I was taken I mean the news hit me and snatched my weave away I was like yo /v Ok so I was at school and I finished my work early so I went on a game site. Then an ad for South Park season 21 came out. I was like oh shit oh shit so I refreshed the page xD really excited though! /v this is 10 out of 10 work. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT! /v Wonder if Gerald will be punished for his troll crimes, in the premiere /v Rednecks, Randy with something that looks like a giant ass. I am curieus what This episode is gonna be About /v i can wait when the day comes time to get Zack Snyder and Bitch Affleck to be in the South Park episode this Batman Vs Superman movie is gone out of control by MCU Fanbase. /v Matt and Trey said they're done with the whole politically driven episodes like they did in season 20. In an interview, they said they're going back to the insanity they used to do. They're tired of Trump everywhere all the time (and I completely agree). 21 will be NOTHING like 20 and I can't wait! /v I've been waiting for this forever /v South Park selling out to the left. Used to be straight edge, now you're cucks like the rest of them. /v Will the new episode be on Hulu? /v High Five, to all South Park Fans!!! :D /v There's a bee in here! /v YES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASURE. THANK YOU MAT TREY /v HAHAHAHA /v nice 2 second clip guys. /v Perfect /v THEY TOOK OUR JOBS! /v political randy episode\nsigh /v I really hope trey and Matt know what they're doing. /v feeling good on a wednesday /v STAN, KYLE, STANS DAD, CARTMAN, ARE THE FUNNIEST!! NO EXACT ORDER. /v TEY TOOK UR JEEEWBSSS /v DEY TUK ER JERBS!!!!!!!! /v I l southpar /v OHH MYY FUUUCKING GOD ITS BACK! <3 /v YEAH TIP ASSIST /v This is going to be awesome. /v The last two seasons were fucking AMAZING I don't care what anyone says. I hope they continue in that vein, I'm so excited to see what they come up with this season :) /v I like Trump. No im not a white supremacist nazi or whatever. I just think us americans need to quit being so sensitive. Trump is our callous /v Please make a mockery of antifa to /v I've missed South Park /v GOD I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED /v King of the Hill and Animaniacs are both supposed to be coming back...and South Park could be on its way up again. I'm experiencing 12-year-old giddiness. :D /v Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless /v Even though last season's second half wasn't great I still have hope for this year. /v South park should parody its own fans. Oh wait, they've already done a world of warcraft episode. /v If they continue doing that stupid unorganized serial shit this season, I will shoot up my school. /v Was that Master Chief at 0:05?! /v They will fuck it up same way some how /v This is an unpopular opinion, but so think Season 20 was better than Season 19. /v Hope the take on the asshats at Antifa too because both sides suck /v tonight is new season south park season 21\n\nlike prediction \ntell story why and who people hate emoji movie /v Matt and trey, if your listening, please make an episode about Alex jones/infowars this season. /v OMG another political crap season smh now that South Park is down hill all animated entertainment has been tainted and overdone /v My name is Juggernaut......................and I ran away today /v Season 21 will not be a continuous plot\nSeason 21 will tackle current issues, as South Park always has, but not politics. More of social life in America (and the world)\nSeason 21 WILL step away from Trump. \nSeason 21 WILL be better than season 20! :))) /v Heeeyy ttheyy teerrrk ourr jeerrbbss! /v DER TERK ER JERB /v Watch my YouTube videos /v Why is this trending? /v I'll get it LMAO /v THEY DERK ER DERBS!!! /v THE TOOK UER JEEEb!! /v DEY TOOK AR JABS!! /v Orgasmoooooooooooooos /v Yea, an ad on trending. Seems legit /v I member  /v As retarded as this show is, I still love it. /v Good the only good original programming on Comedy Central is back. /v Long Live the Confederacy /v first anti trump now white nationalists? charlottsville was staged from beginning to end! BLM is real, NBP are real, ANTIFA are real, CAIR is real!!! \nYou guys better not pick the authoritarian establishment side because if you do there goes 99% of your americana, classical liberal, pro western, rationally conservative, libertarian audience! /v The Alt Right is the future! /v Stupid Trump supporters. /v Used to be my favorite show... Stopped watching last season... This season appears to rip on white people... This show needs to go off of the Air /v These two are chickenshit pussies. They'll poke fun of rednecks, Republicans, and people sick of this hypocritical racism bullshit. But, these fucks won't touch Mohammed, ISIS, or the hypocritical Black Power Movement. Just goes to show how weak and one sided liberal Hollywood is. /v Just watched this episode.. the ending was sad.. /v Can't wait to watch this episode, although I really hope Trey and Matt follow through with that they said about going back to their old format, the breed and butter of South Park is kids being kids, more Eric fucking with Butters and the episodes being more focused on the kids! I love their style of satire, and loved their last season with Trump and internet trolling, it was funny, but enough with politics, I was really excited when they announced they were going to be returning to their old ways, so I hope this is a one of episode just to settle us in. /v That bee was black and yellow... that bee was a minority! /v Or, how about a Stan/Wendy storyline, when he accidentally gets her pregnant. /v R.I.P. South Park. /v I told him you were Jimmy Carson, because he didn't know who you were  /v This is better than donating money. She is donating her time and lifting up spirits and morale /v Kristen Bell and Gary are BAMF's.  /v Veronica Mars to the rescue!  /v Anyone else excited for The Good Place Season 2? No? Just me? /v Can John be my best friend? /v A salute to John for his service and thanks for continuing to be a good person Kristen :) /v She is such a class act! /v i love this woman /v My nigga John is the best part /v Kristen is hot on the outside and in. /v It's good to see eagletonians with a kind heart /v Kristen Bell's a cutie. /v Such a sweet story! Props to you and your great attitude Kristen Bell  /v I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER! /v I'm more concerned for Orlando. Will be going on vacation there in a few weeks. /v I told him you were Johnny Carson because he didn't know who you were. /v If only Jimmy wasn't so unhinged off camera /v museum sleep depression laboratory Greek administration across golden release straight. /v These poor hurricane survivors are soooo lucky that a celebrity could swoop in and save them. /v OMG....I never noticed before, she's either cross-eyed or has a lazy eye! /v I hope that Gossip Girl doesn't get hurt  !! /v its kinda insane that only one kristen bell exists in the world..I wish there were like more of the exact same her so i could marry the heck out of her  she is soo darn amazing!! /v Kristen Bell is amazing and beautiful <3 :D /v And I thought it was impossible to love Kristen even more  /v My God she's adorable /v She's absolutely amazing!

I wonder if they are there. /v Good thing there are cameras so she can get publicity this is the second time she has done this. /v Benjamin Parent me deaf talking Good interview tittle job work the vampire diaries and hook line sinker monster fisherman good YouTube video good facebook photo  Benjamin Parent me deaf talking hello the vampire diaries and hook line sinker monster fisherman facebook photo Benjamin Parent hello Jimmy /v what a genuine lovely lady, she's gone right up in my estimation, which was pretty high to begin with /v She is sooo cute i wanna cry! /v Seth Rogen and Kristen Bell were in Orlando but I couldn't go see them because I was stuck inside from the hurricane :( /v Disney better take care of Gary /v Yay!! That's my company!! So proud of our employees for taking care of our residents. /v Aweee john! Whata cutiee, thankful for johns service in WWII as well, what a strong man! /v John needs to die. Hes using up valuable resources. /v OMG! Hollywood actresses are such great and wonderful people. Its no wonder why so many Americans worship them. /v this is what wife material looks like /v Awake for 72 hours and still looking good /v Exactly what princess Anna would do <3 /v So its official she good stay in the good place after all lmao only ppl that watched the show would understand /v She only doing this to get to the good place /v tvcmarketing.com/RGonzales10 and tvcmatrix.com/RGonzales10, instagram.com/rickrgonz_mca_ for benefits and sales opp. /v Aw so is she away from her family? /v Why cannot all celebrities be like her? /v Gary looks like Zachary Levi mixed with Martin Starr /v got to love a Midwestern girl! we know how to party! love John he's a hoot! /v self click revolutionary film statue contrast heat soil huh before. /v kimmel is a sissy, and he knows Trump is a king, /v Kristen Bell, you are the best! I adore you and the genuine love and caring you have for people. You are truly the real deal. /v She is so cute! /v She's a class act. /v She is a beauty in my  /v She is awesome...what a great thing you did...you are human and it shows!!! :) /v Thank you Kristen and Gary and WDWSH for taking great care of your guests during this crazy time. /v Kristen is a superlative individual. And the epitome of cute. /v Johnny Carson. Great joke. K. Bell at her best. /v So good to see that everyone is fine. If you have any news of where all the black people gone please let me know, (anyway I can see that the black y are fine obviously...) /v How about you Americans stop wasting 54% of your taxes on military and the weapon industry and creating a proper infrastructure (including a flood relief structure (Romans had an underground sewer system which protected them from floods and is still intact...and over 2000 years old), a flood and other natural disasters counter force instead of military. Such a shame that you are antiSemitic and didn't vote for Sanders. And: you have to create a 24/7 citizen surveillance against all members of the House and Senate. /v america is really good under natural disasters. very organized /v Maniquin challenge /v I can just hear Joe Gatto screaming: GAAAAAAARYY!! /v wrong really please  this look viopently  overlook /v Great people. /v i love her.. /v She is my fav actress! /v **Jimmy Kimmel is liberal propaganda** /v She's amazing /v She's awesome. /v http://share.robinhood.com/rynek3 /v Her Side piece  /v #TeamGary #TeamJohn /v https://www.facebook.com/donate/278948485937418/ /v https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuA6NXfSZePanlqpxJJtxSw?sub_confirmation=1 /v KRISTEN U  R THE HUMAN ..THATS ALL ..A human behaviour ..love yoi /v Celebrity done well! /v boring /v She aint bad   /v https://www.gofundme.com/college-classes-and-books /v Thumbs up for Gary ! /v #iLoveGivers! :D /v how sweet /v Bless your heart  /v Aww I love Kristen /v Dax must have been terrified  /v Lovely woman. /v shes amazing /v Kristen Bell is really a demon succubus from the fourth layer of hell. She's actually there eating old people, no one notices a few missing old people in a hurricane. Her cover as a beautiful, talented, classy lady is a charade, and when she collects the last of the Black Rings of Raziel, she will open up a portal to the depths and unleash Armageddon. Only Craig Ferguson and his side kick John Cena, can stop her now... Geoff the Wizard of bones predicted this while drinking with me one night. /v She should definitely go to 'The Good Place' now  /v Kristen is bae. /v How cool is Kristen Bell! God bless her heart. /v Sometimes I think YouTube should get rid of the dislike button...\n...I'm guessing that at least 107 people thus far would give me a thumbs down for saying that. /v Kristen Bell will you divorce Dax and marry me? Please? I'll worship you forever. /v Congratulations! Good luck in Canada, Nile ! /v Hey Nile. I am fan. I am from India. How can I get on of your T-shirts? /v Aweeeee!!!! your dad is super funny!!!!!!! so cool to see your family so involved!  much luv to them and you from California  /v Great job  \nNeil were all proud of you! /v Way to Go! Congratulations all the way from Texas. /v You and the boys should play hide and seek in the gym sometime. I think it would be a good time. /v I was literally crying at that high bar :'l /v Your dad is a legend and congrats!! /v who sings you are the sunshine in my life /v Congratulations! You're such a harder worker and an inspiration! I've been inspired to get back into gymnastics being a former competitive gymnast myself. I'd LOVE to get my stalder press back. Keep up the great work Nile!! /v Well done Nile you did amazing  /v You, mister, are absolutely amazing! Congratulations!! Not letting a pesky ankle surgery stand in the way of your success  I think you'd be a really good coach, have you thought about coaching later on? /v Always enjoy watching your videos Nile - but I never usually comment - However I enjoyed this one so much - your family are just amazing and funny too - especially your Dad Neil - glad we've been there and helped you a little bit along the way too :-) Paul @Teamplsport /v Keep going strong brother... Your inspiration to everyone in the world! /v I'm so proud of you Nile!!! What a champion! /v You rock, like honestly. Love from France!! /v You have the coolest dad ever /v Nile's daddy is SO HOT!! WOOF!!! /v Would it be possible if u could post a house playlist??? /v You did so good, I love you xx /v Had goose bumps throught the entire video.\nYou are one of the biggest inspirations for me to got to the gym and train train train /v your the most inspirational guy iv'e ever seen thanks so much and i'm glad you won /v You are so good at it congrats /v hi, welcome to Chili's /v Literally am overwhelmed with the support you have from your family . You have over these past few months proved to me that it doesnt matter what or who you are you can achieve anything i have a baby in hospital he had been there a year and i want him to achieve anything he wants with support from family you have proved anything is possible /v Well done Nile! So proud of you , you really are an inspiration to us all, thankyou for sharing your journey with all of us viewers #trainsmartkeepitreal. Laura /v Congratulations!! nice to meet your channel\n\nP.D: Time - Hans Zimmer song was amazing in this video /v Congrats Nile!! I've been watching your journey for a long time now and I have to say this video almost bought a tear to my eye. I bet your family are so proud as we are as your subscribers. Your motivation is inspiring, keep up the hard work and become the best. /v Always keepin it real. Congratulations Niel! Good thing your dad won't need therapy and wont gain an eye switch. Lol He is so funny. /v The last scene made me so nervous /v It's actually made of chocolate. \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v Good job, Nile! ;-) /v Congratulations Nile you done very well from kai /v 8:03 is crazy!! The turn, i didnt even realize.. Nice! /v Which remix of sun comes up is that playing please ?? X /v Hey Nile , your motivation and positivity is incredible,and you could probably succeed in literally anything you put your mind to. How did you decide that it was gymnastics you wanted to devote yourself to? /v You are such an inspiration Nile xx /v Why the fuck is this dumb cunt always trending?!?! /v Your HBar routine actually made me tear up  /v Nile, you have a wonderful family!  You are a special young man.  It is great getting to know you from your videos.  Throughout my life, I only watch Olympics and other than that, I am not one to follow sports.  Essentially, I watch only 2-minutes of sports per year is what I tell folks; as that is the length of the Kentucky Derby, which was started by a distant cousin of mine in 1875 and it is the oldest North American sport.  Getting to see more of the behind-the-scenes watching you and that seriously cute Tom Daley, and the other cute gay man, Steele Johnson, has all been fun.  Until Youtube, we only knew what little we saw about athletes on national TV.\n\nIt is great that you are documenting your career so be able to reflect on it in your future, but also to leave a positive legacy for your family.\n\nHey, your videos could be greatly improved by avoiding having the constant moving of the background where the brighter lights show up.  Always having the lights BEHIND THE CAMERA means that you are better illuminated and your camera has fewer problems trying to deal with that constantly changing background.  A tripod could greatly improve these issues.\n\nGenerally speaking, you need to always have Key (primary lighting on YOU), then a secondary lighting from one or both sides (but the light fixtures are not seen in the view of the camera), then a lower backlighting to dress (illuminate the background).\n\nAs you are using auto focus most of the time, then it is vital you don't have stronger backlights or the audience cannot see you or whatever you try to show.\n\nHaving that natural backlighting becomes too pronounced during segments of the video.  Finding somewhere for the sit-down interview is less upsetting for the audience than having too much swirling of your background scenery.\n\nRespectfully,\nBrennan\nCinematographer/aerial videographer/producer/etc. /v Anyone know the song at 6:50 /v Anyone know what the song at 6:50 is?? /v Gave me goose bumps, you have worked so hard for this, i subscribed when you just had your injury.

You can earn money by typing the product code at this link: http://xjderedrmo.date/7304331504103/ /v Gorgeous and your skin is flawless! On my way to your next video! /v The foundation really looked like her skin color, damn Rihanna doing good /v This was such a wonderful, in depth review. I feel like you covered all the possible questions I could have about the foundation and really appreciated the swatches and oxidisation tests. Even though I'm super pale and wouldn't be using the same foundation colours, I found your video to be really informative and helpful. Plus you're super sweet and beautiful. Subscribed! /v Omg you're so pretty! And so sweet an genuine, I love you so much  /v your skin don't need no foundation baby! It's flawless! I have to give a human sacrifice to glow half as much as you! Thank you for your review! /v You're so freaking beautiful omg. Your skin is so perfect and clear and here I am fighting acne & blackheads  but slay girl!!!  /v Aaaayyy I love this foundation and I got my foundation for 23 bucks aayyyyyy thanks for Jcpennys for having a saphora!!! aayyy lol /v Wow you have beautiful skin, i envy you :( in a good way though lol /v The color looks really good, I'm so glad that she made an effort to be inclusive. /v Are you half Asian? /v Girl you are so darn beautiful ! Your skin color has me mesmerized tbh, so smooth and it has a natural glow and my gaaawwwd <3 New subscriber right here! /v Your skin is BEAUTIFUL, could you do a skincare routine video? /v Your skin looks very moist and your eyebrow is fantastic .. /v Is it weird how a ferry beauty by Rihanna ad came up when I clicked on this vid ? /v You are stunning.  You have beautiful flawless skin prior to foundation but it looks really good on you!  New subscribers. /v How have I not come across you before?! \nMy absolute favorite thing is when I find a YouTuber that I can listen to them talk & not want to turn it off after 5 minutes. Definitely binge watching your channel tonight :-) /v You are so beautiful!  /v Your skin is so flawless u dont even need makeup gurl /v First time view and I subscribed. I'm glad to see a positive review of the Fenty foundation, I feel like people who don't like it are used to a foundation that gives more dewy-ness. I'm curious how it compares to the Hourglass Liquid to Powder, which I have but it's old and thickened up. But let me ask a question, people keep saying it oxidizes, but a lot a matte liquid lipsticks dry down darker and I don't think people say those oxidize. I consider a foundation to oxidize if it darkens throughout the wear time as it breaks down. Cars don't rust instantly,  it's a slower chemical reaction. I think anything that is liquid to powder just darkens a little with dry down, so you just need to swatch and go with something that appears lighter in its liquid form but dries down to its actual color. Thoughts? \nI also got the primer, touch up powder & brush, and some samples to try; slapping it all on tomorrow so fingers crossed it's as good as you made it look! /v I love the way she talks! /v eeeeeeeeeew ugliest bitch I ever seen!! black is ugly the women OMG they are like ugliest the last race any one would want hahaha /v You have such beautiful skin /v how amazing that its 2 days later and you're already more than halfway to 400k. get it! /v You should try the Idun Minerals Norrsken liquid foundation. I think it would look really good on your already beautiful skin. /v Wow so beautiful!!!! You don't even need to wear foundation! /v The fact that when I went to the mall to get my own Fenty items, ALL the shades in your skin tone were pretty much gone... that will tell you how much these makeup companies that think darker skin tone girls don't really buy makeup or whatever their excuse is to not make darker shade ranges are Completely wrong! It actually made me so happy like I wanted to cry  Rihanna really thought this whole thing out and I commend her for that  /v Color worked and you look so dewy.  I think it worked beaut9 on you.  Very pretty! /v Girl you don't even need one drop of makeup. Love ur vids but shit if I could walk out tha house lookin like u do naturally I'd be set  /v What a natural beauty /v your voice is so soothing! /v I actually feel bad when girls with ur skin tone can't find products that match ur skin. I really hope things change and you guys have a wider selection. Your skin is so beautiful though mashallah u don't even need foundation. This is the second video of yours that I've watched. First video was the KKW review. /v You are very pretty... /v Dude you got almost 70k in 2 days? /v You are seriously the most beautiful person I've ever seen before. I'm in love!!  /v How is your skin so shiny all the time  Oh my god. You don't even need makeup /v Your skin is so beautiful!! If i had your skin I wouldn't even use foundation!!! /v So since the foundation oxides . Will it be better to go one shade lighter? /v What's your favorite foundation?? I am using the fenty right now but I also have the oxidizing problem, so I just bronze my neck so I don't look too orange lol. Do you like the Lancme one better??? \n\nReally awesome review. I'm binging your videos right now and I'm obsessed! Easily my new fave YouTuber! :) /v Omg your skin is fucking amazing! I'm so jealous right now! Jesus Christ how can U be so god damn regal /v Really like your eyebrows. Btw you are really pretty /v To be honest, I love what you're doing in the YouTube community. Thank you! /v Love the warmth in the foundation color. It's gorgeous on you. My pet peeve are the ashy looking colors. /v Legit the only video I was waiting on for this product! /v wow! so pretty!!!! also you gained 67k in two days so proud /v I'm so done with all the comments on her gorgeous chocolate skin. That is not a compliment even if you think it is. You can call a dark skinned black woman beautiful without comparing her to food. It's so cringey and patronizing. Think about it, do you go to a fair skinned white womans channel and see hordes of comments going on about her light vanilla skin? Typically not because it sounds ridiculous and it is. /v i like your skin /v You don't even need foundation your skin is beautiful. Ugh I'm jealous! I hope you have skincare routine videos. #subscribed /v You just want something to complain about girl this foundation looks bomb on you and matches your neck !! /v I thought the foundation was kinda light, but I actually think it is more because it looks warm toned on her hand swatch. I feel like her skin is more cold... I wonder... Glad Rihanna said there are going to be more shades in the future. /v You are one nature BEAUTY! /v This video is about hitting 300k and a couple days later you're about to hit 400k /v God WHAT A GREAT SKIN!!! <3 I have problems to find a very pale color in foundations, in Brazil it's more to the medium shades! Happy to see all this beautiful skin colors covered in this collection! ;* /v You have an amazing glow and the foundation didn't seem to take that away at all. A great dewy look without appearing oily. Based on your review I'll definitely try it. /v Why do you wear makeup your skin is gorgeous just the way is it /v Just a thought: I wonder if there is a denser sponge that perhaps wouldn't soak up the foundation as much? /v Girl your skin is GLOWING  /v You skin is beautiful! /v dude , ur skin is so smoothyou don't even need foundation /v this was my first vid of yours but i just wanted to say YOU'RE STUNNING OMG YOU'RE LITERALLY FLAWLESS!  i genuinely thought you were wearing foundation before you started the review. i'm so jealous i wish i was this gorgeous! /v The sponge is for the highlighter for under the eyes that's why its shape like that... The brush is for the foundation... !! After 7.5hours still looked flawless Great review #Riri /v I got emotional during the part when you said you saw other gals who looked like you getting matched. That makes me sooooo happy and I think we need to really make it known to the beauty community that ALL shades of people love to wear makeup and want a shade that works for them. Even if this formula isn't the best for a majority of people the fact that the launch had 40 shades needs to be commended and applauded very very loudly. Thank you for the thorough review, beautiful!  /v i think the sponge didnt work the way you wanted coz you probably didnt wet it? maybe try that and then see..u might like it... /v Great review of Fenty Beauty Nyma! As a dark skin girl myself, I'm so pleased to see we weren't left out the shade spectrum of this makeup line. I know the struggle. This foundation looks like it really matched your skin tone.o /v You have the best skin in the world jfc /v can we get a skincare routine? your skin is flawless! /v legit subscribed and added you on sc in 2 minutes of this video, you are gorgeous and sooo sweet /v Beautiful! And now I gotta try a sponge for foundation instead of a brush! Thanks for the tips! /v You are soooo BEAUTIFUL!! And your skin is like butter!!! I'm so jealous!! /v Girl your skin is glowing!!!! /v Question: Is it fair for someone with flawless looking polished skin to try a makeup product that is supposed to make you look flawless? Your skin looked glowy and bright from beginning to end. Love your videos! Keep it up! /v This is the best foundation I've seen you try, it looks so sickening on you. This makes me want to start wearing makeup /v You're skin looks awesome is so shiny and you are so gorgeous  /v girlieee  drop that skincare routine  /v You are BEAUTIFUL!!! /v You are sooooo beautiful omg /v youre so pretty!!! /v Black girl magic  /v She's so ccccuuuuutttttttttteeeeee. /v Jesus your gorgeous without makeup , /v beautiful /v Soooo pretty /v So beautiful!  /v Beautiful  /v  /v So stunning! /v Dam bitch you beautiful  /v So pretty. /v OMFGGGGGG you have flawless skin! /v You are soooo beautiful.  /v She is stunning  /v I loveeee you sisssss /v let me just say, WOW! <3 /v Your skin is amazing! /v Girl your skin is gorgeous!!!  /v I love your skin. Flawless love /v Gorgeous! /v Beautiful /v Girrrrrl what is yo skin care routine  ya gorgeous /v Omg I wish I had your complexion  melanin  Poppin /v Best first look video. Can't believe big site like engadget filming their first look on a phone, out of focus all the time. You delivered proper first look :) /v Rip samsung S8 /v i thing samsung is fucked right now... /v How to be an android fan. \n1. Search for every iPhone video ever\n2. Use any words to insult that product \n3. Say apple is old and copies everything (false)\n4. Use and absurd amount of this emoji  /v People need to understand that Apple product is a symbol of wealth. At least apple makes people think that way and give their high prices a good reason. Samsung makes great piece of technology but after all its just a good tool for daily use. /v Where my Apple  fans love this iPhone X /v People are going to look retarded in public doing livemoji or whatever is call /v Watch Messi best 5 goals don't miss it --->https://youtu.be/hYGDpubSeoM /v i must say... this phone is impressive, but even with the portrait mode and stuff like that, it is not so useful, come on guys... are you gonna change the photos the entire day? and who is going to live in wonderlands to use the magical effects that they showed to us like robots fighting? I mean its awesome but it doesnt justify the price, and for a good camera and a nice display and a useful way to taking notes, I prefer the samsung note 8, so to Keva Kevincek, I dont think Samsung is fucked, they may be actually happy to see that their product is more realistic. /v Please cancel the iphone 8 releasing and release the iphone X insted! /v ! /v https://plexcoin.tech/?ref=sihQolPZ9j\nI HAVE alrerady invested 1000 $ to this coin if you register through this link you ''ll get 5% bonus plexcoin coin have already been sold  36,283,300.35454368 PLX more than 108 000 particapate in this project now is the presale time you can buy coins through debit card or paypal, credit card , ethereum, litecoin , bitcoin depends on you 1 coin price is 0,13 $ after presale one of it will be 1,76 $ prediction is after end of year one of its price will be 5 $ plexcoin will be next bitcoin hurry up for buying your coins           Note: 1 coin will be $ 0.13 that first day.

I just wonder if it can also do 'bokeh' shots with the front camera, though. Huawei's P10/Plus front camera Portrait Mode can do that artificially (front camera's just a single lens module), and I think iPhone should be able to do that better (due to better 3D depth detection tech?), based from this walkthrough. /v Say thank you to Samsung for that great AMOLED DISPLAY that Apple ordered.. /v I wanted an s8 but after seeing this I definitely want this more /v How can I unluck my phone if I have no face? *_* /v Steve Jobs once said to start with the customer experience and work back to the technology.  Apple has clearly lost that vision and is working the other way around.

Nice #iphoneX ; /v Does this only work on the X or will it also work on the 8? /v iPhone X has ears :P I hope the next generation Apple will reduce the front camera n all censors in the black bar. ;) /v Stop shaking the camera! /v Looks like shit. /v Apple has completely copying Samsung. /v Looks slow /v Supper Apple 5 stars. /v You didn't show Face ID at all.

The way apple makes app exit & multitask are pretty much the same i guess /v Another gimmick for the common herd. /v Who wants to Buy my S8 plus?! /v Gimmicky very gimmicky and hardly a One hand use phone. /v Too much reflection /v Hey #VIPs & #NotificationSquad!! I'm just gonna say it - this cake was literally the HARDEST cake I've ever made on this YouTube channel. By the end of it, I just wanted Lloyd to Ninja-GO away!!  What's the hardest thing you've ever done? Comment BELOW! /v I would love to see your rendition of a chocobo or moogle cake! To be honest probably anything Final Fantasy related haha /v Make a fried chicken cake, please /v Why is the fondant so thick? /v Can you make a cake shaped like a pill bottle with klonopin in it. Or a tree shaped cake or a whole roasted fish cake , pickle cake /v 3things:\n\n1.The bumps are called studs and I think the symbol on Lloyd's band means his element, nature. \n\n2. (Just something to share with the world) When I was listening on my bed to the video, I heard ding-ing noises and I thought it was me brother's phone, but it was the music. Before I knew it was the music I got so annoyed. \n\n3. Yolanda, I doubt you'll read this but, I love your videos and your amazing sense of humor. You truly are the Beyonc of cakes. I wish you the best of luck with your cake therapy, wish I could relate, but I'm not an amazing cake decorator or even a cake decorator... /v Hi Yolanda, I have a Lego cake due in a few weeks, but it is not a life size.

I love all your cakes they look so real. I cant believe how long they take. How they look are the best. I watch your cakes every Tuesday and I won't miss them ever. Since I watched your pancake cake which was your first one. This channel been my favorite one out of Rossana Pansino, IJustine, and MyCupcake Addition. My favorites cakes are the peanut butter and chocolate cake, this one, the cookie cake with Mr. Friday I forget his name, the football cake because I love the Eagles in NFL, I liked the nachos cake because Chet was being silly and funny. The spinner cake is one of my favorites because I love spinners. I love the animal and emoji cakes because I love animals and I love emoji cakes. I cant believe you took 4 days on this its so amazing and you should make all of the ninjas because they look like they are real in real life. I so wish I could go to Canada and meet u in real life. You are my inspiration because ive been always cooking with my grandma and helping my mom and knce I saw these cakes I want to make them and make them awesome just like you do and u are. I love when you make a (not to be mean)  lame jokes and Joslin (don't know how to spell it) makes her laugh and Jeremy just standing there being like why am I here. I wish I could do camp cake u always had and maybe still will but I'm very sad I can't to do. I'm so glad I got to say this to u on here because you are amazing so much to me and to the whole world. I even follow you on Facebook and if I could get on my Instagram i would follow you sadly I can't because I forget it. If I could pre-order your book because if you say there amazing then they would be awesome to make but I can't and im disappointed I cant. If you love this whole message because this came from my heart please shout out me because I would love that. Cant wait to see your next cake and wonder what its gonna be. If you could can you try or do a Husky cake because I love them and they are my favorite animals. Sadly I cant be a VIP either.

You look good either way! /v How many titles can one video have? lmao /v What a wonderful Q and *Gay*\n\n\n\n\nSee what I did there? ;) /v Is it weird Iv had a crush on you like since like the beginning of my drunk kitchen like about 6 years now my god why are you so beautiful  /v I thought the Q in LGBTQ stood for Questioning. ?? /v When you click on a video that has 69 hundred views and your inappropriate /v Hi I'm Hannah. Bet you didn't know thaaaat\nHi my name is grace helbig, if you didn't know now you know /v I love you so much. As a gay woman in the media you have been a huge inspiration to me. So thanks I guess /v HANNAH!!!! try beemster mustard seed cheese. It's amazing. I too looooove cheese and mustard and that shit is gold /v Hannah's right, queer is reclaimed. It's ours. Doesn't mean everyone's going to be comfortable with the word, of course, and people who don't want to use it about themselves don't have to. /v I miss kitchens. There was a kitchen right there the whole time!   I kept pointing at it but it didn't help.\nQueer is reclaimed. /v I relate so much to being this tired and also I really want your hat /v Mustard or cheese? Did you know there is mustard seed cheese? /v Hat on, because the hat is as 'CAP'tivating as you! ;D /v I use fag to describe myself all the time /v Loveee this - if anyone needs more gay in their life I write gay songs  /v I love your Q&Gays :) \nSigned, a super queer fan /v I dont know what f... Word your talking about ? /v cool hat /v I want to put my penis in her vagina;) Also, she looks like she's really good at soccer;) /v My boyfriend and I have already reclaimed (trigger warning) fag. He calls me a fag playfully /v I agree that queer is reclaimed! A lot of people use it as their sexuality to keep from boxing themselves in too much /v Did anybody else think Q stood for questioning? /v You are absolutely wonderful!!  Just adorbs!  I love your story and your channel and we LOVE I <3 FOOD!  My wife and I dvr, we have to watch together ...and we love food, so there's that!   I think you are such a voice for the LGBT community and hats off to you  ;)  #WEHEARTHANNAH /v great video! I really enjoyed it but also couldn't help noticing your Catan game in the background, and I wanted you to know that the game has started wars in my family but I love it and I'm glad that you seem to like it too /v I always thought the Q inLGBTQwas for questioning /v She's like the dictionary definition of spunky. /v Also dealing with the whole name thing... Family doesn't even know it's something I'm doing. Though all my friends know and use the proper name. And I've even started introducing myself as that name. But family??? Family doesn't know. And wont for as long as I can possibly keep it from them /v I'm glad to see that you play Catan /v Ash Hardell made an awesome video about reclaiming LGBTQ+ slurs. You should check it out! /v Hat on is gay culture I'm glad you kept it /v You're adorable when you're tired  looks like an awesome trip..and cute kitty  I couldn't pick between one cheese the rest of my life either /v This is a real question I have had for some time about the word fag (and yes I type it out because it is just a word coming from a curious mind trying to understand some things)\n\nGay, queer, homo, and many more represent all genders\nFor females, dyke is bad but lesbian is good\nHowever,\nFor males, fag is bad but WHAT is good?\n\nI myself am pan, and never cared what I was called, but I have known many who do. And I would like to know, besides the blanket terms that count for all, if there is a proper/polite way of saying it specifically for males? /v i too am completely obbsessed with my cat, still am and ive had him since May 2017 /v If you're not sure if your hat was on or off, rewatch the video. HTH /v This was really great and real! Thank you for taking the time to make a video, your authenticity is very grounding. Also take care of yourself!! /v Doesnt the Q stand for questioning? /v I love your comment about the words queer and f**! I personally would never feel comfortable saying the second word because I'm a woman and I think that word was a slur used for gay men so that's not my territory but I do actually identify as queer! When I'm talking to other LGBTQ+ people I'll just refer to myself as queer but if I'm talking to a cishet person I'll tell them I IDENTIFY as queer, just so they don't go around thinking that the slur is okay for them to use, and so when they refer to me they can say, Oh she identifies as queer instead of, She's queer. I hope that makes sense? That's just how I see it but I'm sure there are many other adaptations. /v Were you excited the first time you climaxed a clit? /v Hannah is really a good apple aint she?.. /v I love you Hannah, you are so real. Thanks for  just being  /v I have a question and willing to listen to any advice given on the subject. Is it offensive/not politically correct to say that's queer? When something is odd or strange? Its something that idk why or when I started using it but I'm on the fence of whether or not I should stop. I'm using the currect form of the word in its original definition but I would never want to offend a stranger by saying it. /v I saw a longer version of the lgbt name ( LGBTTQQIAAP+)  which pretty much includes everyone /v The hat on/hat off situation reminds me of coming out chapter 3 so bad :D /v Love this! You are so funny! /v Cheese all the way, no brainer /v Oh hat all the way /v I woke up to a purring cat this morning and I had the thought that if I someday became both  blind and deaf the one thing that would make life worth living would be a cat. So glad you have Charles and you know the love of a cat. /v @3:11 - Harto could't MUSTARD up the strength to answer that question. *sigh, I'll see myself out. /v Whatever happened to Hannah's dog? /v Hat on! \nYou're cute when you're tired but I also feel a bit sad that you felt the need to hedge your words so much. People on the Internet can be mean. We love you and know that you mean well!! /v Hat on please. You and hats should never be seperated. :) /v It seems our best chance to get questions to you is Twitter. I generally answer on your Facebook, but only because I'm not active on Twitter. Darn /v Ahhh I am so glad it's not only me who starts sweating when overly tired. /v Can you please make a cooking for Charles my drunk kitchen? You could get him that cat wine and he could be a star. /v Funny you have a question about reclaiming the word queer, just because last night I decided that how Im identifying as of right now. I identified as bisexual for a few years, but at this stage in my life Im leaning more towards the queer label. /v I think there is unfortunately a lot of people in the lgbtq+ community who think of Queer as a slur,  I see it mostly with younger people who doesnt really understand the history and struggles older members have gone through to take back that word. I personally label myself as Bisexual but I know a lot of people who arent gay or lesbian that prefer to use the term queer and they should have every right to. /v Hat on /v  /v Hat /v Hat /v hat on /v HAT /v HANNAH IS MR PEANUT BUTTER /v Your freaking adorable /v Am I gonna cry? /v Hat on /v Lindaa /v Hat on! Looks awesome  /v Honey, go to sleep!!!  /v HAT ON /v gay thumbnail is gay lol /v Milesssss  /v Hat! /v hat on /v Honey. Sleep. /v Am I gonna crY??? /v Hat on  /v Hat Off!! Love you!! /v Hat on /v hat on /v hat *ON* /v Totally hat on. /v ENHEEWHEY /v MILES! /v It's funny . . . you used to say the F word a lot, but now you are much more careful about it. Don't know if that's due to YouTube restrictions/censorship or if it's just a sign that you are maturing. I like to think it's the latter. Baby girl is growing up!!! /v I'll say queer but not f*g. I'm a pansexual female so I'm comfortable with the word queer as an umbrella term. F*g on the other hand is different (for me, at least.) I've never been called that (thankfully) so I don't feel like I have a 'right' to use the word. The word  isn't mine to 'take back' because it was never mine to begin with. If that makes sense? I dunno, man. I'm pretty tired myself so I don't even know if this is coherent. :)\nEdit: Formatting /v Is she and Ingrid still together? /v Over time the weirder Rou's hair gets, the more normal the music becomes /v Eh. Not feeling this at all. /v Not bad but it sort of feels like it's about to explode into something more powerful but just sort of fizzles out /v Its like one big build up but then nothing :c /v I'm really intrigued on where the direction of this album is going but nonetheless I'm gonna love it! /v I like it.. and I like the video ! End of the story /v Rou's haircut is rude as fuck. /v Dank.\n\nIt feels like a lightning bolt struck the tip of my penis. /v Love the new songs and excited for the new album.. funny though this strongly reminds me of Mindless self indulgence: https://youtu.be/s_Gyh1r-ut0 /v Sorry You're not a winner! /v I've always loved how they use the synth, and this didn't disappoint. Can't wait to listen to the whole album!!!!! <3 /v imagine if they collaborate with die antwoord /v I LOVE THE UK GARAGE FEEL! this album is going to be awesome!\n\nNew favorite for jogging! /v Not sure if I like this or not. First listen I was expecting some more build up, but it didn't really go anywhere. Having listened to It some more, it has grown on me some, but I don't see it becoming a favourite of mine. Not a bad song, just not amazing. /v This is garbage lmao speaking as a one of the biggest fans since 2010, this is utter shit. Trying to pass this off as maturation or experimenting with different sounds makes you sound fucking stupid, this is straight up pop. Good luck on selling out boys /v Love the change of energy!! So much variety you guys kill it every time /v You make the new genre of music. Awesome band /v Good song I think. Live outside was alright will miss the screaming if they just abandon it though /v Start and middle is Too minimal,only the ending saves the song,think they've changed too much now.\nTrying to keep up with the trends. /v I'm a lyrical spiritual individual lyrical miracle spiritual lyrical /v This album definitely has a spark to it...I'm excited /v This sucking is fucking awesome, holy shit, people who don't like this are fucking tripping!!!!!!!!!!! /v Really intrigued by this and love the melody but the whole tune sounds like the build up to a drop or riff that never lands, and as a fan of heavy music this drives me mad! Where is this track supposed to go. I can picture rock sound reviewing this using the phrases like 'ramp up the tension' and 'tenterhooks' 'working it's way into your cerebrum' and that never corresponds with bangers or big riffs. Anyway, my point is, this started really well bit didn't go anywhere. Build up to a letdown when you think some mad rock workout is coming. /v what happened to shit like ''sorry youre not a winner'' /v this is weird and sick, but its missing some scream :/ /v Nice video showing the possibilities of the new iPhone! /v SO. JUICY. Love it, boys. /v Better than Live Outside, fact /v IM EXCITED AS FUCK FOR THIS ALBUM AND I'M EVEN GETTING IT SIGNED AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /v Fuck and I thought Redshift was as low as these guys would go but then came Supercharge and whatever this 3 minute of trapbop is trying to be. To fans of Redshift I would like to say I am sorry I never comprehended it could get this bad so so so sorry /v I dont know why, but his hair makes me think of Liquid Snake /v The Spark, Dear Desolation, Look At Yourself, The Great Collapse. Albums of the year. #2017 /v This is definitely way better than Live Outside but there's still no punch. I know Shikari has their lighter songs, and I do love the verses on this track, but I'm waiting for some kind of real drive. /v Not sure about this song tbh  but i love enter shikari /v its not rly a matter of opinion, the structure just lacks a big drop, the song stays pretty flat/boring overall . . . /v 181 people are currently getting nervous /v I like the song, but I reckon we could get some really good remixes too /v Took me three listens, now love it. /v Hadouken called, they want their song back. I normally love ES mix of electronic and metal but when missing the metal this is not good imho. /v is this a rofl of bad face masking ??? /v Hopefully all the new songs are the shit ones and its just gunna get better. I hope they have a few trump cards still to play. /v Your green screen is perfect (no) /v Advice to all the people hating on this song/sound: start your own fucking band and do whatever you want with it /v Keep fighting the fight boys! Call out the color deprived commercial music industry with their own music. /v Couldn't help but expect some sort of heavy breakdown oh well. /v No guitar distortion on this album? /v wow this one is a ride /v A little disappointed by this. Bit too slacky... But I love them and know there will be better songs on the album ! /v Where is the fucking rock'n'roll damn it?! /v human music.. I like it /v I'm sorry chaps I've held on since the beginning, but I fear it's time to disembark this ride as I feel it's heading in a direction I'm not keen on  /v Loving the sound of this new album so far. Psyched up for the full english. /v I like his new hairdo /v the song has loads of build-ups that mount up to nothing lol .. can we at least have a techno-breakdown? /v I haven't liked a single song Enter Shikari put out since Flash Flood of Colour... (I didn't think any of it was bad, just not my kinda thing)..... but this is sick. In love with this song! Might have to get the new album.... /v This is the first time I don't like any of the singles released so far... /v Sorry guys, but the quality of your videos are decreasing. What the hell is happening? The keying is worse. /v Like the sound they're going for. It's different and I'm intrigued. I'll listen further. /v This is so hard to evaluate that it's not fun. /v Okay, this might be different from what they used to do, but how the heck does this sound mainstream? /v Can't help but notice that the ID numbers of the band members are the same as the ID numbers on the uniforms in Live Outside. Does this mean anything? Probably not but I love the song. /v By the sounds of it the new album will be poor... /v I admit  that when the awesome like a sack of screwdrivers SCREW SCREW SCREW SCREW part hit, I was expecting the bridge to hit harder after that, but was a tiny bit disappointed. Still like the song tho, and totally excited for the full album /v Love love love it! /v .!! /v Digging that Rod Stewart mullet! /v Egye ki a s a nyakt annak a 210 embernek aki dislikeolta. :D /v Subahannalove  /v interesting.... /v interesting. and rous hair tho /v Absolutely nothing happened.  /v SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD /v I bare like this ngl /v Sounds like something Hadouken! Would do /v hypehypehype /v I feel cucked, I was expecting a heavy breakdown/drop or something. /v Pretty decnt song, not as good as Live Outside but in genetal pretty fine, reminds me a lot of Warm Smiles Do Not Make You Welcome Here. /v I can't anymore I understand as u progress ur music will change and all but lately everything they put out just isn't as apealing anymore /v Sweet video. Looking forward to the album because these boys do not write bad music. The stylistic genre that this might be categorized into, might not be your thing, but as it's been said many times here, We're Enter Shikari and we've been abusing music's worthless genre boundaries since 2003. This is true on their lyrical content as well as their musical diversity. Not every song is going to be a winner with everyone. The same can be said for any fan of any band or any form of media for that matter. Does that make it a bad, not at all; it just means that you don't care for it, but someone else may. \n\nBottom line, this sounds something like that would have come out around the time of, We Can Breathe in Space and Tribalism with the production level of The Mindsweep. I mean Live Outside now that I think about it, really reminds me of a happier sounding version of Thumper. /v One of the most creative bands out there, I love it. /v No se como no les puede gustar, la cancin es completamente mental, presiento que sera uno de los mejores discos de enter shikari, hay una vibra bastante siniestra en estas nuevas canciones y recuerden que en vivo siempre hacen remix o cambios bastante buenos, HYPE AF /v  , )  ! /v Damn dudes, awesome as always!x /v 2:30 is cool /v very poor green screen keying... /v Odd video, odd song. /v Where'd Rou's hairline go /v Amazing! /v Grower not a shower? /v Genius /v wtf is this shit /v So fucking creative I feel enlightened /v Eh\nNah /v Pushing genres worthless boundaries since 2003 /v que bosta. saudades old enter shikari. /v It is exactly Enter Shikari???? /v lol ur old guys /v OMG YES /v Roll on November /v RIB CAGE RATTLING BEHAVIORRRRRR /v I was having a rough day. This made me day  /v You are in trouble, Leah said, where are my babies, uh oh. I live in GA, and we survived hurricane Irma, we had debris everywhere, it basically just rained a lot, and it was very windy. So thankful that's all it was. Take care. /v  I see red and blue and black. And I'm humble. It looked like they were in a hotel suite.  You might want to check your credit card balance...\n\nLaGuardia: It's your father. Amalah: I could tell. Bless.  CLICK   /v I'm your father-\nYeah, I could tell. Bless! *hang up* /v Blulululu red  I love her /v I love these chronicles. So very funny.

Too funny! /v I actually love these videos man /v I was having a rough day and this sure made it better.  Thx and keep up the good work! /v I was very concerned and my heart stopped when he said Amalah had run away. Even in pretense this is very serious. Also Nayale had that phone cord close to her mouth. That was dangerous also. Please dont allow your precious little girls to play with any appliance cords. Soooo dangerous it can blow their minds, electrocute them. To be honest I did not like this video at all....too heartstopping.. /v I swear I love y'all  /v It's cause I have no teeth.

Love you all! /v I have 3 sisters...my daddy had to learn how to handle 4 daughters and a wife. I sent him some of your vids...he just nodded and sighed heavily and said yeah...he knows  we love your vids!  /v I love your videos,you and your beautiful wife are so fortunate to have 2 beautiful girls,they are going to be so close as they grow,they remind me of me and my sister when we were babies!!!Heart warming every time!!! Shalom! /v That innocent Good morning was so cute! And the combo of Leah's voice and that phone harlem shaking had me shook. Better get them babies back stat! /v Nayele is like the cutetest thing on the planet!! I just wanna cuddle her she soo cute! /v When I see the title I was like OH NO WHERE HAS AMAHLAH GONE . /v seriously my middle daughter at that age was so fast and disappeared on me several times. If we were in a clothing store she was usually under the racks. :) Have fun with that. /v Nayely is getting big! So super cute!!!!! These videos make my day! Love you and Leah & the girls!!!!! Be blessed!!! /v I watched this last night as I was falling asleep. I'm surprised the laughter didn't keep me from falling asleep.  So much to unpack LOL ! /v She's never had teeth!  /v LMAO! Leah's gonna get you about her girls...you keep on! /v And ther's a little beaty beatle ....cuteness overdose. lv ya all /v Was Nayely holding the other end of the phone cord?!?! /v I will laugh all day!  /v Her & sis got things to do /v  so funny when she put the baby on the phone /v You done lost the babies?

I wish u guys were every day but once and on my fav day of the week just makes the heart grow fonder and the viewing even sweeter!! \nI've just had my lil girl and I know I've got so much to look forward to. /v For some strange reason I actually like the sprint Spanish commercials /v Lmao your daughters are the cutest.

I especially like the part about how his friends would judge him and the twisty slide bit. That's good stuff. Word painting. Nice. /v Just admit it Pennywise! Just admit that you like being a clown! I would be that monster friend. /v Sadly, they didn't really explain Beep beep, Richie in the movie.\n\nIt was actually what the Losers Club said to stop him when he ran off at the mouth too much, which happened a lot. /v I believe he turned the kid to go after the others as a defensive mechanism. For the first time, he has something hunting him down. If he fears that they might no longer fear him, then he may want or need outside intervention. /v Physical trauma is a weakness of mine, too. /v damn, lady! you look hot in this vid <3 <3 <3 /v I think he manipulates people into killing because a murderer on the loose is freaky, and he might feed off of any fear, not just the fear of him. /v I will always upvote a Jenny video. /v Is clown college still a thing? \n\nCLM /v It was more of a comedy then a horror movie honestly /v When the patreon credits came up.... WHOA!  O_O /v IT and a Turtle are Mortal Enemies. /v This video was ripe for clown-nose wearing potential.  Wasted. /v what the hell was that the vietnam wall memorial for the ending ?\nwtf was that x) /v What are you afraid of Jenny? /v I heard this theory that hes a clown because pennywise the identity, is of a serial killer like John Wayne gasey in that universe. Because all of the forms he takes are of preexisting entities, like Beverlys Dad or the lumberjack statue or the flute painting or Georgie /v Where is the giant porg!? /v I gave Jenny a thumbs up for the massive list of credits at the end, amazing :)  Your humor is top notch /v I love you Jenny /v penny wise & pound foolish. no one needs to know this tripe. learn to read a real book like The Way of All Flesh. /v Funny how? Like I'm a clown, I amuse you? They shoulda gotten Joe Pesci to play Pennywise. They coulda had him beat some kid to death with a shinebox. /v I wish she could make a movie, so I can try really, really hard to make a sarcastic video about it...... /v Ok, this is my favorite Jenny video by a wide margin. Her, I guess you'd call it trademark almost bored tone made describing a killer clown the funniest thing I'm likely to watch today. It's 7am and I've already hit my funny peak. /v From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic. /v my god what happened to your porg! it shrunk! /v A big spider huh....thats an interesting notion ;] /v Why is that porg so tiny?! /v Nah, penny wise says beep beep to Richie as a reference to the book. The kids used beep beep as an indicator for Richie to stop running his mouth yeah? /v I'm sorrythat was a great videobut the camera wasn't set right. /v Jennys hair looks like she got shes all that-ed right before she started shooting where she took off her glasses and shook down her hair in slowmo....but then couldnt see so she had to put the glasses back on /v i always figured that the more fear a kid experiences the more the fear flavor builds inside them. Like how adrenaline makes animals taste gamey. /v I was just picturing Pennywise telling the Crimson King he was going to take the form of a Clown. /v Do more stars wars erotica fan fiction. /v Ok well now I feel like a total idiot for liking the movie. Thanks Jenny. /v I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even! /v it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over! /v I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol /v In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster. /v There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown. /v YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this /v I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign. /v Never trust a man with large shoes.. \n\n\n.. my dad put on his size 11's and walked out on us /v Hey! This was fun. I'm curious, did you enjoy the movie? /v Just watched the 90s version.  The talking head in the fridge, shaking and yelling WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE! was a reoccurring thing in my childhood nightmares.  Looking forward to the new film. /v Soooooo, did you like it? /v YES! My biggest problem with most horror movies is how illogically the murderers behave. Why would you toy with your victims in a way that implies there is an audience watching? Unless......are the monsters aware of us, the moviegoers? Is Pennywise's food actually our approval as the audience? Dun dun dun!!! /v Deadpan, deeply perceptive, ironic, hilarious and very clever. Not sure if we deserve you, Jenny (meant in a good way). /v This movie was great though /v What are you looking for is reference to which pill was Eddie looking for. /v I'm new here /v So everything from this point back is Pre-Porg. You can tell by the hollow and soulless look in her eyes. /v I know nothing about any sci-fi but i find her delivery so funny that she is one of 5 youtube subscriptions i have. /v Oh how I wish, not for the first time, that I hadn't read the godawful Youtube comments. /v Honestly, if I hadn't read the book and had only seen the movie, I wouldn't give a shit about who the kids were and what happened to them. Like the movie was 2 hours long and we barely learned anything about our main characters. /v Pennywise likes play with his food. There, 65% of the plot holes are covered. /v If I had a penny for every beep beep is from the book comment on here I'd be penny wise /v What if he went across monkey bars whilst upside down... like all gravity defying like? /v So, like a crocodile, Pennywise is an ambush predator. ;) /v You're very pretty in glasses /v You're so pretty. /v Just admit to us that you like being a clown haha, I can imagine him sitting there with a sad clown face when they say that to him. /v My goodness you are attractive /v as glad as i was when you went over to screen junkies just in hopes you'd make some money off your work, these are by far you best videos.  millennial falcon is great but i'm interested in hearing what you have to say on more than the one topic. /v 3:13 He can dance if he wants to.  He can leave his friends behind.  Because his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine.\n\n*safety dances out of the comment section* /v I am so glad you did a video about the film! I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie. /v You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better /v I never cared for Pennywise the band /v With the final confrontation with Pennywise they should have played a song from Queen. /v I've always felt that the deadites from the Evil Dead franchise feed off of fear as well, that to them it's a kind of art. Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk. /v Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though /v You're braver than I. I was not going to watch a killer clown movie. /v Hey. Jenny. You. Are. Beautiful. And. Clever. :) /v 4:10 o my goodness i didnt even think in that scene that way, now thats the only way ill think of it now. I HATE U FOR THIS /v The clown, not the punk rock band /v I adore your sarcasm /v i see you washed that porg and it shrunk down to a managable size. /v Pennywise likes floating. /v Yummy. /v Hahah /v MeOw. /v Jennywise! /v I like this. /v You are gorgeous /v Stop trying to make Twisty Slides happen Pennywise! /v Marry me /v Ok /v Great stuff as usual... :) /v Jenny is Pennywise, but occasionally she is Porg foolish. /v  That was... funny? I didn't laugh, but I'm pretty sure this was funny. /v For once, I completely agree with this lady. Pennywise was not scary, and IT was very disappointing. /v The sausagefest that is your patreon account is always the best piece of comedy in your videos /v Long time watcher, first time commenter. Your awesome. That is allz /v Sarcasm for most of the duration of this video... a big dislike from me. Just say it suck already if you hate it so much.. rather than beating around the bush like some b**ch! /v holy fuck was she bit in the face by a dog when she was a kid or something? /v Look, someone who didn't read the book. How could this very simple concept of a movie elude you? My 9 year old kept up, I thought you were intelligent... Or is that just what you keep wanting us to think that? Also, 42 percent of people are afraid of clowns. And pennywise got greedy and wanted all those kids and he built up their fear for too long. Clearly to his down fall... Do you even pay attention to the movies you watch or just pick up shit you wanna bitch about to be a hipster? /v You're beautiful and a nerd.  <3 /v shut up /v I'm over here getting in trouble because I'm dancing in class and getting hype from this song.. Sorry teach but I'm saved!! /v Who is here before1 million !?? :D .any hardcore david crowder fans here !!? /v Literally, I was just wondering when the next crowder song was going to come out and here it is.

This was beautifully done Galen I sincerely hope we get more films from you and your team in the future! /v i don't understand this...what exactly is the story here? /v YES! The Queen has provided yet another inspirational video! This is such a heartwarming song and video and dance! Congratulations on this piece! I'm excited to see what's next for you!  /v This was absolutely beautiful and haunting. So, many things could be taken from the storyline and pairings alone. Great job on the location, story, styling, camera work, choreography, song and of course the dancers. Jasmine Harper's legs in that scene are incredible /v SO BEAUTIFUL!!! you are forever my idol  /v So beautiful like omg ms hooks u have just outdone yourself /v I really like the song. Not sure I fully get the story. Really nice though. I love anything with Jasmine Harper in it. /v This is amazing, the beautiful choreography, the music, the voice, the filming, the dancers. Everything just fits together perfectly. /v But will you wait for me?\nUnderneath the old concrete\nUntil we can say our peace\nAre you waiting for just for me? /v So cool! I loved this idea and the diversity in this video! You guys killed it!!!! /v best i have ever seen... Beyond words Galen. /v Such an inspiration, thank you for sharing your knowledge  /v This is incredible. Your choreography and everything that you do is so incredibly inspiring. /v Most of the time, I don't really enjoy concept videos. I want to get straight to the dancing. But this was incredible. I was hooked from the first second and did not want it to end AT ALL. Amazing Amazing!! /v Seriously so beautiful!  just an exquisite piece of cinema.  Galen! /v Everything about this IS AMAZING  /v incredible!!

Documentaries are too dark for the younger audience. /v its 4:00 am\ni need sleep\nbut i need Carol MORE\n\nI'M SO BAAAD /v Where can I get a pair of them pants please Carol? /v Carol is my spirit animal /v Wow this feels like it's early YouTube again!

Don't trash them. /v Is he trying to be like Brandon Rogers /v Gus is my spirit animal. /v I'm ready for a Carol Cinematic Universe /v Oh no I'm in love with you /v Gus  is slowly evolving into HowToBasic... Lord help us all.. /v How is this available in 1080p? It looks like it was filmed on a android potato\n\n\n\n\nGet your shit together Carol. /v Is this tech rax now /v WOA its the same laptop from when you go to class and open your laptop but forget you were looking at adult things /v Am I back on Tinder /v You are seriously my favorite channel. /v That's some nice original content you got there, itta be a shame if anyone were to repost it and profit off it.  ~9Gag /v Carol is taking over /v Gus Johnson breaks a laptop: a short film /v GUS YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT I GOT AN AD /v Gus, that shit was very funny I want more of you.....please. /v I'm in love with the song at the end of all Gus's videos WHERE IS IT FROM I NEED TO KNOW /v this is like budget Brandon Rogers /v Your videos actually suck.\n\nI love them. /v I used to laugh at jokes like him puking up his popcorn, but now that I'm actually going through that I don't find it funny anymore. I understand it's a joke and I would never ask someone to not use that as a joke as long as it's in good fun. But it still gets to me. I really hope that the stigmas and shame surrounding eating disorders gets better within the next few years. /v It's funny because it's true /v 1:15 that actually took some skill as QB I would kinda know /v I'm a watchin' woman. /v What is the song that plays at the end of the video? During the subscribe screen? /v Gus, what is happening to being subtle !? /v         /v I love these videos! I kind of want to see more of Carol. Love this series if that's what you will call it! /v Practically Neil Breen with how you treat that laptop. /v Well... I guess this passed as entertainment. /v Jesus fuck these videos keep getting better and better. /v So after carol's wine addiction caused her to loose her job and husband she turned to Netflix to fill the void in her heart /v Comedic gold. Lol I love this character haha /v THE HIKE MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD THE SHIT CAME OUT THANK YOU /v Is this the same character as in the wine video /v Now I want a Brandon Rodgers and Gus Johnson collab /v this made me do a giggle /v this is gonna be the best series on youtube /v Oh I could go for a slice right now /v This is what I expect to see from an experienced Youtuber. /v These new bits are your BEST work.  You've got an excellent character going! /v This reminds me of those Fred videos. /v I really like his Ohio State mom tshirt  /v Gus: hmm, i have an old computer that doesn't work. Should i throw it away? Nah, i have a better idea! /v I go to OSU are you my mom? /v The music at the end really helps me to reflect on what the fuck I just watched. /v How many laptops have you destroyed for this channel? /v Oh Carol ur such a card. /v That song at the end always calms me /v PLEASE make more obsessed with videos. /v this character reminds me of gayle waters waters /v Someone has been watching Brandon Rogers! /v it made me so sad when he smashed the laptop /v make a vid about people who won't shut up about himym /v How this Video was made:Hm...i have a laptop that i can destroy and it's pink with Stickers. What to do? /v I'm guessing someones laptop broke before the video? /v Legend says Carroll is still looking for the pass /v YAAASSS CAROL. ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE U, GIRL. /v This is the video I want aliens to find millions of years in the future /v I love this series. /v damn gus you looking THICC in them yoga pants /v Go long Carol!  Looks like Carol needs some more wine. /v I am still confused as to who Carol is /v Neil Breen would be proud. /v 0:34 I lost it!!! *HAHAHAHAH* /v Classic Carol /v Typical Carol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v MORE CAROL /v I want your pants. /v Oh Carol, you're so crazyyy /v Too real /v Carol's obsessions are hilarious! /v You have a nice ass..Carol? #datbooty#noshame#gettinit /v omg moooooreee carol please /v EVERY.BASIC.WHITE.WOMAN.IN.COLLEGE. /v More Carroll /v Oh Carol. /v Okay. /v That was fuckin beautiful /v CAROL IS BACK. /v Carol is back! /v LOL 1:42, BAH /v same neighborhood as Khonjin? /v What about starbucks? /v Gus, i'm scared /v This. /v STARTIN TO SMELL LIKE ASSHOLE IN HERE /v Ohio State mom /v Who is she? /v soaps and streams /v Lmao who else got a Netflix ad? /v More Carol videos please! /v *lEaVe mE AlOne* /v He's stupidly good looking but that's not all, there's more. He can sing and act. How does one guy get so lucky /v Some of ya'll need to realize that Harry didn't cover this song to one up the original or make a better version. That was 100% not his intention going in to cover this song. He loves Fleetwood Mac and he has said on several occasions that Stevie Nicks is on of his biggest inspirations. Ever stop to consider that maybe he covered the song because he just wanted to sing a song he loved in tribute to a band that means a lot to him? /v Most of the comments are on his voice which is good so I'm pleased comment section /v Is it wrong that I watch this everyday?? /v This is one of the greatest things I've ever heard wow goosebumps everywhere /v The woman playing the piano looks a lot like Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2! It's kinda funny as well how this is one of GOTG2 soundtracks /v Mitch's P90 loaded Les Paul Goldtop and his tone is soooo soothing! /v I love you and proud of all of you  /v Thanks to this hipster twat one of my favourite songs is now ruined. I can just here the autotune that they used in the studio. One Direction was shit enough as it is but the fact that they're trying so desperately to cling on by doing solo careers after they should've stayed broken up and gone is ridiculous. /v the drummer is way to fast, but than again its hard to drum this song /v I'm sorry, but how about his fucking band /v Talented performance all around... But that guitar tuning! I bet that was just killing that dude the whole time too  /v Guardians of The Galaxy...  /v I want to listen to him singing in my shower so bad. /v I love the vibe he gives /v Get me off this millenial wonder page asap /v Fantastic vocals. But the electric guitar was not in the same key as the original. A bit distracting. /v I dont want this to end!! Damnn u harry /v *tone of the chain* where did my wig goooooooooooo?? /v Can we just take a moment to appreciate Harry's voice AND THE GOD DAMN  Drummer!? WOW She killed it :D                      HARRY TOO with that angel voice <3 /v did not care for it there isnothing like the original /v wow nice cover man you should audition for the x factor or the voice or something /v Favorite singer singing a song from a favorite movie of mine /v Some into the wild soundtrack maybe, it would be amazing /v Side note: did anybody notice the running time of this video? 4:20! Ha! /v u need to get kaleo on this show!  /v Harry Styles has no talent! oh... right  /v I'm glad this is a thing /v That guitar solo killed me /v i'm so here for this /v I NEED A WHOLE MF ALBUM OF COVERS LIKE THIS MY GOOOODDD MY MANS DID THAT  HES SUCH A DOLL IS THERE ANYTHING THAT HE CANT DO FUCK /v Everything about this is amazing, seriously /v The guitar was not very good at all. Didnt capture lindseys vibe at all /v I'm so thankful Harry appreciates the magic of fleetwood /v I swear this incredible ray of sunshine never ceases to amaze me /v MY GUY I LOVE YOU BITCH /v I'm crying he's so beautiful and talented and ahhhhhwhshshsh my baby /v Omg my favourite band fleetwood mac being covered by my fav British boy Harry styles /v Where can I download this??? /v They couldn't reproduce Lindsey Buckingham's lead solo.Close but no cigar /v What a talented human /v This, his cover of Ultra Lightbeam, and his cover of Wild Thoughts NEED TO BE ON SPOTIFY SO I CAN PLAY IT ON REPEAT /v Is this heaven, hello? /v L O V E his talent  /v yo, I love fleetwood mac, and when I found out Harry was doing a cover, i almost cried /v I love you now, and forever. /v tons and tons of talent ever since the x factor days.. doing so good man i'll see you october 10th :) /v Im just always amazed every time he sings... He is such a beautiful human being! /v my dad just said harry gots a good band he's really not fan Harry and the 1D boys but he likes it. /v Not a fan of HS, but this was phenomenal /v When you get a ZAYN ad... /v THIS IS MY FAVORITE FLEETWOOD MAC SONG /v he's amazing, and his band, whoaaaa. that bass line is tooo fire /v He never fails to amaze me /v talent at it's best. there's nothing this man can't do! an absolute legend! /v Ugh i really didn't want to like it but he is good . Kudos. /v MY FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD SINGING MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SONG, I DON'T DESERVE THIS /v we love stanning a talented king! /v I'm dead by /v *harry claps\n*everyone claps /v i am speechless /v SHOWTIME A-HOLES /v he did that. /v NOW DO TUSK! /v zzzzz /v This video is 4:20 /v THIS SHIT IS BREATHTAKING BRO /v Looks like an adolescent Steve Winwood. /v i nutted 4 times /v https://youtu.be/riOq8pRl7vs /v he killed it. /v Uncle Liam Gallagher please /v soft /v He's like alittle baby munchkin /v Yuck. /v Clare is so pretty  /v Ooooh wow amazing  /v WWWWOOOOHHOOOOO /v fucking brilliant! ! /v THIS IS PERFECT IM SCREECHING /v awesome band....and harry /v This is insanely good /v THAT WAS AMAZING /v Absolutely amazing. Love you guys. /v The hottest thing ever! /v MYSWEETBABYIZZABRILLIANT~WONDERFUL~AMAZING~SENSATIONALEXTREMELY~TALENTEDILOVEYUIBABY #R1LiveLoungeMonth /v TEMAZO /v kill me /v i stan /v speechless... /v fuck yeas /v Good version  /v SHIT FUCK HARRY,  I WANNA KNOW WHO THE BACKGROUND VOCALIST WAS AND HOW SHE LIKE HER EGGS IN THE MORNING ( I'm an avid Harry fan, don't come for me) /v Sorry but Harry Styles is the only person from 1D that has actual, natural talent. /v As a guitarist and not really a huge fan of Harry styles, this cover is fantastic but that guitarist ruins it, out of tune and just seemed like he didn't know what he was playing. /v Imagine being this talented and hot at the same time.  Just Harry Styles, everybody. /v posernstheposerbansdsysfvcsksysvonslysfleetwoodmacsysdosthlsfvcsksysvposershltesforssvresys /v Did Mitch cut his hair /v The thumbnail shows him playing the guitar but he's not even playing it in the video lol /v The real question is... When does he hold the guitar like in the thumbnail??? /v Haha Jim Carrey trolled the fuck out of you! /v I feel sad for the Fashion Lab people. Sheep. /v watch his video talking to inmates from june of 2017..... /v This'll be the best interview she'll ever have, and she made herself look like a complete idiot by looking at him like he's crazy. /v It's called science, Derpina /v I think he is more sane than anyone there. /v I want to punch the dumb interviewer and dry her wet hair style out. /v sorry, tv show, but Jim is truthing you. that  you do not (yet) comprehend, is not your fault. soon, you will understand. lolmao. /v Havent ANY of you seen Jim Carrey pay tribute to Steven Spielberg? This is just a brand of his humor get with it. /v Umm! Ever thought he's actually explaining reality dumb ass reporter? Even mainstream is justifying we live in a holographic universe! On my gaaaaad! I hope your postage stamp mentality can cope with this!! /v E!... News, is that possible? Is there any fake news and fake periodism that is E! News, so sad. /v The beginning of the interview she said Jim I heard your wandering the streets looking for a new girlfriend after only a year and a half since his girlfriends suicide that has caused him so many problems really? That's how this bimbo starts the interview ? I think he wanted to fuck with her, and speak some truth in the process. Jim you are the most sane person in Hollywood and it scares these status quo shit peddlers we call E News. Keep on keeping on man! /v Yeah edited to make that dumb lifeless shape that calls herself a woman look half past the hollow shell that she is. Fuckin hate them obnoxious glances she keeps giving the camera the stupid dim bint /v Dude what the fuck. E news didn't show all of it. Jim Carrey doesn't have a twisted relationship with fame. Jim Carrey (somewhere along the way) humbled himself and realized that the world doesn't revolve around money, fame, and the spotlight. There's more to life than Hollywood and I'm actually with Jim on this shit. It doesn't matter, not a fucking bit. Psychedelics may or may not have been involved in his thought process but at least he's not a scientologist. /v This happens when you take too much substance. /v lol he's just having some fun with the low intelligent interviewer. It's all a joke, she takes the event too seriously. /v wish E would stop acting like this is bizarre Jim just realises how shallow all of this bullshit is and doesn't feel like putting on a mask anymore. props to him. /v Clearly this chick reporter has no depth to her soul. Her reaction of Jim Carrey's interview was superficial and judgmental. And her facial reactions blatantly confirmed she has no clear understanding of what this world is really like.\n\nKeep living in your fantasy world woman. Because if you had no clue of what Jim was talking about, time for you to have a reality check and open your mind. /v If you ever get a chance, watch the DVD extras of a movie called Bat Thumb. The character who plays Wuce Bayne has a speech just like the start of this video. Mannerisms to a T! Hahaha /v Bunch of airheads over at E! News, I'm in the dark, what's exactly the issue here? /v He is a powerful man, well done JC. /v This is what happens when a monkey try to read a book of knowledge /v Who is truly the brainwashed sheep. Jim who has seen the truth, or you who are still blind.\n\nI'll let you think about that one, Catt. /v He legit is the only sane one there....and her saying she's sad for him is the saddest thing ever...these corrupt lowlife self-contained robots are the downfall of this world and because this man actually sees life for what it's really worth their going to make him look insane....they need to look at the monsters they've become...hypnotizing a generation into being stuck up judgemental snobs....shame on them for doing that to our youth....the message Jim Carrey just sent out live to the world is what needs to be known ....we're all energy ..they want you to see black white yellow brown....he doesn't see that and neither should the rest of us....we're all the same in the end /v Just because you can't comprehend what he tried explaining to you doesn't mean something is wrong with him.  Stick to fashion. /v This condescending, pretentious nitwit couldn't hold a deep conversation with someone as much as a glass of water could. He's right: fashion week is pointless. Her job is pointless. Entertainment news is pointless. /v What's wrong with her hair in the interview? /v Honey your brain is too limited to understand what Jimmy and similar people are talking about, btw look at your dislikes /v That woman is an idiot. Why would he want to agree to have on open conversation with someone with nothing but dead air between her ears? /v When you talk about something different and try to have a intellectual conversation rather than who's sleeping with who or which celebrity is pregnant or which one has the biggest tits all of a sudden you are bizzare /v Fashion week is a dull event with dull people. It seems Jim had some fun amongst so much vane people. /v Wow, I expected the interview to be so much more shocking. These children can't have a conversation these days. It's all about me! me! me! me! me! me! /v Most meaningless thing happening. I'd say he's spot on. /v You should not be sad for him, I'm sad for you and your audience that doesn't get it.  The rest of the world needs to catch up with the wisdom he is sharing. /v I think it's important to watch the full video. I believe he's on to something. This version is horribly edited. I think Jim Carey could sit down and explain this but I think the background laughing and editing on this video don't do the full segment justice. I know they have to keep it short but I like people to provide the link in the description if they are going to edit something.\nHere's the link to the video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5s0vpVIOXg /v People are so judge mental /v Hahaha E! News are retarded. Love you Jim! /v He was clearly fucking with her what an idiot she is to not understand that /v lol you guys got called out and cut it out of the video\nLmaooo get fucked. /v He sounds like Jaden Smith.. but fuck them for shaming Jim Carey /v What a condescending shallow cunt and those 3 other cunts laughing.. Yes it wasn't the best place to express those sentiments BUT nothing he said was bizarre or indicated a man who has lost touch with reality if anything it was the opposite and btw he's a comedian so the joke is on y'all. Also why would he do an interview with someone so unprofessional. /v Lmfao now she's going to go crazy with the comments because she thought everyone was going to be on her side lol /v please stop giving energy to the reporter... this is the most publicity she's ever gotten in her life. lets stop doing her favors /v He was serious.  Fashion is shallow and the amount of emphasis placed on it is obnoxious.  Art is important but fashion is no longer art. /v Guy is losing it, just like most Hollywood stars ... duh fuQ is going on in Hollywood?!? /v The red pilled your meaningless zombie life, but you're to drunk on the kool-aid to see the forest for all the trees. Clearly he was the only human at the event. Go back to sleep zombie girl, shhhh good night. /v THAT'S THE 3rd FREAKING TIME HE'S TRIED TO EXPOSE HOLLYWIERD AND IT FELL ON DEAF EARS... SMFH... SO SAD, BUT WE HEAR YA, JIM!!!!!!! /v She's dumb as rocks. /v i hope you die bitch /v How is this trending with 176 comments.. This is why I hate the trending tab.. Because it's all dumb as fuck /v He's the only smart one there. /v Like me IDGAF about what famous rich people are doing and wearing. Not one fuck. /v This guy is a real dope /v He is above your condescension, obviously. /v i was a little sad for himmmm... ya know??! /v Sad for him? So u did get the message /v Who the fuck is this bitch. Idiot /v U can see n.hear satan all in him never listen to long to a liar they start confusing u ...its never chamged since the garden of Eden in genesis...jim carrey neeeds to repent its hard to tell who for god these days but to sum it up he is bashing god in.his deceitful way...saying there is no god may the lord turn his own toungue against him and counsel against him to foolishness...go bk to the garden of eden.PEOPLE stsrt over repent romans 10:9 is the way obey gods commandments luv him above all build a relationship with him thru jesus christ he is awesome n.he loves u...never forget that Deuteronomy 28 and 30 ... /v His clothes look like they are from the VR related movie Spielberg is making... The Oasis scene... /v Hey Lady if by talking seriously  you mean talking about clothes, shoes and gossip then you shouldn't interview people as Jim Carrey. You have two different levels of consciousness and yours is pretty low. All I see in this video is a very intelligent and spiritual man talking to an ignorant woman who cares only about the surface. He should have looked at you the way you've looked at him. But the world's crazy and unfortunately people like you are considered the 'normal ones' and the ones like Jim Carrey are the 'freaks'. Sad story. /v This is what Mastodon use to do on the Grammys for the same reasons, I think. /v People call crazy what they can't understand /v Nothing bizarre here. Whole thing is being over-hyped smh media. /v E news is absolutely meaningless. Everything E news represents is meaningless. E news sells empty, consumer driven preconceived notions of a beauty and cultural ideals. Maintaining a distracted audience dedicated to mindless celebrity worship to keep the gears of conformity continuing to rotate further enriching the wealthy and large profit-seeking corporations. /v Isn't this the belief of the Democrat party.  No this is Masonic teaching. Hahahahhaba /v This is seriously what you guys talk about in California? How fucking boring... /v BITCH!!! maybe all this entertainment business fucked with YOUR head /v This chick is such a moron /v Come on everyone! Listen to his words. He's babbling Scientology bullshit. /v I didnt listen to any word that was weird. Im not even a jim carrey fan. Media sucks. /v He's talking about awareness. He's talking about Advaita, non-dualism, Lila, Tandava, cosmic unfolding. Whichever name you want to give it. Sounds like he's annoyed at the materialism of Hollywood and his mandatory role in these sorts of events. Also sounds like he's having a bit of fun while having to go through the whole rigmarole. Perfectly understandable. Is this actually surprising to anyone? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised :D /v How much hair gel is this bitch wearing? /v This title of this video is incredibly condescending. Way to go E! /v He goofed with you and you don't get that, he doesn't give a fuck because you are there for him hes not there for you. /v Terribly rude interviewer... lost a lot of respect for E News after this and won't be watching anymore. /v I laughed when she said Jim Carrey if you're watching this and want an interview i'm ready..... the fu*k b!tch he doesn't care about you, you're not even the level of his shoes. /v Jim Carrey  \nIs amazing /v Stupid bitch!! /v Everything he said just went over their heads. In a world of ignorance, truth can sound insane. Might i suggest you all squeegee your third eye and realize that ego is a mental delusion, that's what he meant by there is no me. Personality like Celebrity is an abstract, what are we without our names, jobs, social status, etc? A bunch of tetrahedrons A.K.A atoms. That's it. We're star stuff as Carl Sagan put it. /v THAT was what the fuss was about???  LOL .. its just him messing off!  WTF is all the fuss about? /v E news, WTF are you on about.  Jim is on point, you guys are just a fake bullshit media outlet and you're not what the new generation seeks anymore either.  The new generation can pick and choose their media and the younger people have realized that being spoonfed this garbage doesn't help them at all.  They would rather be enlightened.  Your days are outnumbered. /v You suck ugly lady without a soul and those other bastards!! you people  are  /v Illuminati /v Piss taking shallow fuckers.. fuck Enews /v jajaja clickbait only, E! nobody watch you anymore ... /v You got trolled you dumb cow /v She is meaningless /v stupid cunt /v What a CUNT!! /v E news sucks! /v Lol /v Jim gets it lol U stupid bobble head U  dont. /v stupid cunt /v *deep* /v 151st /v die from ebola jim bob /v This Nigga Need Jesus. /v The black dude is SUUUUUUCH A FAAAG /v hasn't he been channeling carl sagon lately? /v Wow... you suck at reporting. /v the slow roasted onion and mustard is goood. also it's beqa with a Q and it's a brand of cheese /v Mate , if you are going to eat honey soy chicken ships you HAVE to get the red rock deli brand, all the others cannot be compared lol /v Americans don't know what peri peri is? it's so common in the Uk  /v Why does this make me want to devour 20 bags of chips?? /v What's on fire in the mirror? /v My name being peri was very confusing in this video... was I named after a flavor ?? /v We have pizza too \nPaprika was my favourite ridiculous Canadian chip flavour  /v Thought it was Hulk Hogan in the thumbnail. /v Where'd ya get that squirrel ring?? /v In Japan there's a salad flavor that tastes nothing like salad, but I actually really like it. /v I'm from Bega (pronounced BEE-GA) and Bega cheese is massive in Australia. My boyfriend works at the cheese factory and makes the cheese. So surreal to see my tiny town on your YouTube channel!!! /v Mama Mia got me EVERY time /v I just came here to say Fuck Meghan Rienks and Grace Helbig;) I didn't watch the video;) /v You should've been more Australian and done flavour of shapes or Tim tams /v (347) 563-4092 this is graces number you are all welcome call her a lot so she can make a video on it /v I am so shook. I had no idea that all those flavours were not totally normal..... /v Show lots of feet plsss.make my day amazing again /v grace has a crushhhh /v blue juice *drinks powerade* hahhhhhahaha /v Peri peri is nandos sauce! /v These are pretty much regular flavours in Canada /v You don't have cheese and onion crisps in the US?!?! /v I miss all of those flavours! Canada's chip game is weak in comparison. Those Kettle chilli chips are the king of chips! Did you try Light & Tangy Lays chips? They are also really good. /v What the F is going on in the mirror behind you?! /v Lol I hope you actually liked it here in Australia /v Go to England and do the same taste test Grace. Apparently they have Australian BBQ Kangaroo flavoured chips. I gots to know what they taste like! /v Ketchup chips taste like dirt to me :/ Cheese and onion forever :) Red rock deli is fab too /v drunk me *loves* those lime and black pepper chips. /v I WAS IN THE CROWD AND I CAN SEE MYSELF /v Bega is pronounced like it's spelt, with an E not an A. You said it like Baga ahaha /v i love how she called the powerade/gatorade blue juice kasdfljlsdfjk /v If you're still in Melbourne go to Pelligrini's it is THE best italian restaurant and the best coffee in Melbourne please enjoy <3\n(if you go do a video or something I will figuratively die) /v hey he was on snl /v You guys don't have chicken chips??? Wtf it's like a staple in nz /v It's beqa with a q. I'm Australian clearly  /v do you not have nandos in the US? /v Normally Nz and Ozzie food is the same but these chips are all unknown to me except lime and black pepper /v this just made me really feel like chips tbh hahaha /v Woah I never realised other countries didn't have honey soy chicken chips!!!! There like a classic here /v Us Australians  need to make Vegemite chips /v Its actually pronounced Bekah (its a q not g) and its a brand of cheese here in Australia /v Oy I'm not triggered... /v i thought peri peri was like spanish or something lol......didnt know nandos created that bc i see peri peri in a lot of places not just nandos /v Now you've made me hungry for chips. I live in melbourne too. perhaps i can take your left-overs off your hands /v Oh how I love being Australian /v When you have to look up what Bega Cheese is.... /v The Ketchup flavour first came out when I was a kid and I wasn't enthused by it, by now in my early 30's I think it's great. I don't know. /v the red rock deli honey soy chicken is better........ -your friendly neighbourhood Australian /v Great first date tip at 4:57: ''Blindfold them immediately and force-feed them things they don't know!'' My favourite flavour is the ''Kettle CHILLI with Jalapeno & Red Chillies'' now that you've pain-tested it (at 6:20). /v I was so surprised that they don't know what Peri Peri is  we have Nando's here in Pakistan  /v This makes me so hungry for chips.

UGH IM SO HAPPY FOR U!!!! /v Peri peri is a type of chicken /v Woah didnt know she came here for Vidcon, wish it was in my state though :( /v why did he buy all the bad ones givin us a bad rep /v The pronounciation of Bega is bee-gah /v Wait - I thought all countries had a billion chip flavours...\nWelp, I guess I'm just a very sheltered Australian teenager who's never travelled out of the country. Lol. /v grace, love ya, but bloody oath if i hear 'tomato sauce' being called 'ketchup' once more,,,,,,,, boi /v Ohhh cheese and onion is the besssst /v Omg it's bee-gah (bega!). And pls try the correct brand of honey soy  /v You didn't get the good Honey Soy! /v I love all of these chips !!\nOh and it's oi not oy /v bega is a brand of cheese so it was cheese flavoured /v I lost my shit when I realised mature cheddar cheese and chive literally is just sour cream and onion  /v I live in Australia. I love ur vids btw  /v Honey soy chicken is my go to drunk chip packet!!!!! /v The Beqa one is cheese. Beqa is a brand of cheese. /v Mine are barbecue, cheese & onion and light & tangy, but i can't get with those regular cheddar flavours. \nAnd chicken I can't stand, it really tastes nothing like it. It just tastes like bad memories... /v the way brooks says bega though    /v But what flavours are in the USA????? /v Did anyone else die laughing at the pronunciation of Bega?? Australia represent /v You missed the classic addictive original Pringle /v Mine are honey soy chicken (red rock deli), they are bloody amaaaazinggggg! Glad you enjoyed Melbourne darl x /v I've been to the US and you guys have way more chips than us Aussies do. Shit like BBQ Chicken Fairy Floss Hubba Bubba Mint Chocolate Oreo Red Pepper Sriracha Gun Powder Cheetos /v Take off your sunglasses /v Good vdeo. /v perth? /v We normally call ketchup tomato sauce. /v It's spelt oi oi oi  /v Shouldve tried shapes!!!!!! :) /v Peri peri is spicy /v we dont have brisket in aus :/ /v It is pronounced Bee-ga /v Sour cream and onion pringles woulda been better /v PERI PERI CH8CKEN, PERI PERI CHICKEN, PERI PERI CHICKEN CHICKEN SUB /v It actually goes Aussie Aussie Aussie OI OI OI!!!!

CHEESE AND ONION ARE A UK STAPLE ????? /v Okay but for real I eat a bag of honey soy chicken chips almost every day I LOVE THEM /v this was super great /v Mmhhmm, a cat-culator - also known as the only tool capable of of preventing a cat-astrophy from o-purring in the first meownth of the year. (Go ahead and slap me) /v Wait hold on....in the episode where they talk about scary stories she brings up Jason takes Manhattan, but Daniel has to correct her because she hasn't actual seen it.......wait........ does this add to the messed up timeline /v Im pointing out that back in season 2 I would say episode 7 Katie says she has never seen Jason takes Manhattan but now flash forward a few seasons she suddenly knows EVERYTHING about The Jason series like okay it's been a few years about there is no way that she could watch all the Jason movies and enough to connect the dots between two different horror movies and now so much about these films off hand like excuse me no I couldn't tell you what movies I watched 3 years ago hell I couldn't tell you what movies I have watched last year /v I feel like I want to pull up a chair at the table and join in! /v Not funny at all..complete garbage know thinking animations or jokes /v Bleh, the timelines totally add up, but, ok. Not a very funny group of people either. I suppose this channel is just not for me. /v I'm disappointed that at no point do they mention the Corey Feldman video... /v Why Voldemort was secretly Gandalf is a topic I really want to hear... /v I hate to say this, but four minutes in, my mind is actually getting dumber from listening to the Friday the 13th 'mythos'. /v Starline in the background makes me happy. /v Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for someone finally bringing light to the screwed up timeline from Friday The 13Th /v Best friends are back!!! More funny people please and thank you /v the Fast and the Furious has a fuck up timeline it somewhat made since and then the 8 movie came out and blew it to hell. Dom and Elena baby is a few months old that child could not been conceived no later then the beginning scene in Fast 6 FF3 take place after 6 and before 7 and while we don't know how long FF3 happen after 6 but it seem like the movie FF3 was over a few months with the main character Sean and Han had was in Tokyo way longer then that. Now we know the 7th movie take place right after the 3rd movie hell the timeline over lap between the 3rd and the 7th because Hobbs has a fight with Deckard Shaw that how he get the info on Dom team and while he killing Han he called Dom while Dom house explode, but while he having the fight with Hobbs in the beginning you also see Elena in that scene and she is no pregnant and her and Hobbs fall out the window.  That baby should be way older then it is. /v You forgot that john doe also had to take the time to carve the skin off his fingertips... /v So the 1st episode of After Hours takes place in 2010 cause in the curses episode they showed a clip from the 1st episode with a title revealing it took place 7 Years Earlier. Then they didn't do another one until 2017 cause they been going to that dinner for  79-80 consecutive days, and Katie mentioned the new Friday the 13th game that was released in 2017. /v The Friday the 13th timeline math doesn't work. If Tommy Jarvis is 12 in 1984, then he's 17 in 1989. And if Tina Shepard is 7 in 1989, then she's 16 in 1998.\n\nEven if Tina is actually 7 in 1990, then she's 16 only in 1999. Neither 1998 nor 1999 are 2001 /v actually their marvel theory won't work after the captain marvel movie when her and a young nick fury face the skrull /v Captain Marvel is said to happen before Iron Man 1. So he has her. But we gotta wait for her movie to see why she ain't there. /v Thumbs up just for the old cast! /v uh, Jason isn't 50 or immortal. he's undead from 6 on. I don't think the undead celebrate birthdays. /v 9:07 There was alot more crap going on then just that. Besides the fact that they were planning ahead, super-powered and freaky things had been going on since WWII. Nothing about inviting Tony to the Avengers was at all reliant on Cap turning up, or Thor existing. And they already knew about Hulk. /v Did he just break the 4th wall at the end /v What's the film after Friday The 13th that they discuss? /v Damn the replaced the fine ass dread head in the back /v DANIEL O'BRIEN STOLE MY IDEA! What he said its exactly what I posted on several videos with the Nick Fury after credits scene a very long while ago, seriusly look it up.\nNot mad at all, actually kind of the opossite, its really bizarre to see my ideas coming out of his mouth, its almost line by line. What an honour...\nJust asking for a shout out! /v S.H.I.E.L.D is dealing with super human threats even without Captain America ever since Agent Carter and Howard Star started it. And Hank Pym was around for a long time even after WWII. You failed the Antman movie, After Hours team. The Avengers are just a scouted new superhero generation. /v Did you see that katy? I diagreed! Kek. /v NO Nick Fury ,, fought off Skrull off before he even meet Tony ,, this alll will be reviled in Captain Marvel  that would be a time based movie set in the pass before Iron man and Hulk and Avengers /v If that theory about Gandalf secretly being Voldermort is a real theory, I'd love a video about that /v Michael, why/how are you in the audience of the Dave Chappelle Netflix special? /v Catculator... that got me way too good /v Your Marvel theory lacks X-Men. The Avengers are only separate in the movie universe because of the studio rights. Nick Fury knew there were super dudes and many x-men were avengers in the comics but can't be tied again due to rights. So realistically, just as in Deadpool where other x-men were referenced but not show because they couldn't afford rights for any major characters, there were plenty Superheroes in the world to justify the creation of the Avengers.... just not enough studio cooperation to do so lol /v You forgot the best Friday the 13th film- Jason X /v I love that Daniel pronounces Voldemort in that annoyingly correct way, instead of how the say it in the movies. /v What's in the box? /v With the mcu time line there is a theory that Nick Fury is a clairvoyant so it would make sense that he knew all about Thor, The Hulk, and the New York attack so that's why he recuited Iron Man before any of that happened. /v Wtf is this shit? Lmao \nThis acting corny af! Like watching a group of retards act /v Oh god. Thanks be to putting the originals back on. Gooooood job /v Fury is not crazy:There were not just reports of The Hulk, the US military fought him and then he fought Abomination downtown. He already had Natasha and Clint on his payroll. All that was missing was Thor.Besides SHIELD probably knew about many others. Even so, the World Council knew about this, which would make them crazy too. /v Katie's hair looks fucking amazing /v You need a Cat-culater! /v hee, catculator /v Is no one going to mention the fact that Hawkeye, Black Widow, Ironman, Ant-Man, Technically captain marvel because her movie is set to be in the (90s or 80s), and presumably the hulk, is still an amazingly good team for the avengers initiative. /v I'm so glad she brought up the Friday the 13th timeline. I've always tried to pinpoint the years that are supposed to have passed between each film. Also, when she mentions the Evil Dead being part of the shared Universe, it should be noted that a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason was drafted that had Ash from Evil Dead fighting them both. /v I thought of the same thing Daniel did and asked the same thing. Fury wants to establish a response team to supernormal threats, but who is on his list? Romanov and Barton? 2 human SHIELD agents? Plus, he didn't even want Stark. He wanted Iron Man. So who is actually part of the Avengers Initiative? /v Did you just say that the first Iron Man took place before World War II? /v Did they meen army of darkness not evil dead /v thank the mighty buddha it's not the other four /v ya the A team is back!!! /v Wait.\nThe incredible hulk movie enstablished that hulk ALREADY exists in the mcu, is not an origin story. /v These are all consecutive nights? I always thought that they were weekly gettogethers. /v Friday the 13th < Nightmare on Elm Street /v Nothing like the originals! /v The thing from Se7en bothered me too /v Wonder how many movie timelines do add up? /v Katie is a Friday the 13th fanatic? If I wasn't married I'd be proposing right now /v Man...I need to go watch Seven... /v you're not supposed to think about these things!!! jeez! /v Thank fuck it was the A team, am I right? /v i think these all line up perfectly. so therefore. i win /v The marvel one isn't valid. Fury new about the existence of Iron Man, Hulk, Ant Man, and potentially Captain America. Its also possible he knew about Black Panther (as seen how Wakanda is a highlighted region on Shield's map in Iron man 2). Apparently, he also new about Captain Marvel, which takes place in the 90s. \n\nThe point is he knew there were other super heroes in the world besides Iron Man and was likely planning to recruit any that he  could to be on the avengers. /v never leave again bitches. i almost said goodbye to afterhours /v Ya sorry as much as I wish I liked the new crew the original 4 are just so much better /v Have y'all got star doing the drawings now? /v I have a whole seven page timeline on Friday the 13th. /v Katie is a boss. Finally a proper break down of my other favorite Friday film series. Wait what if Debo is Jason??? :O /v I should not have laughed so hard at that last cat joke... /v Ah, the reason I subscribed. Before the SJW preaching videos appeared and made me wanna puke. Good times. /v After Watching: 300 Viewers Who Don't Care /v So... are we all cats then? /v Please please please oh please just stick with these four /v Why is Jake Paul in this? /v Nick Fury is like the NSA being created after 911. A catastrophe happens, and he jumps on the opportunity to create his superteam project because tax dollars are flowing to defense spending. /v I won't read this comment. What a Dick I am, I can't believe I just read this. I am pathetic! /v Wow...everyone just shittin all over a beloved horror franchise lol /v Wow. Even if we assume the After Hours guys only meet once a week, 80 episodes means they've been doing it less than 2 years... It feels longer. /v Ima be that guy. Agents of SHIELD showed that SHIELD had its eye on, and if I remember correctly locked up, plenty of super powered people. Its just that none of them ended up making the cut, which is pretty amazing because thor made the cut just by showing up and trying to kill cap and tony. /v Is After Hours usually this high def? /v I've seen the Marvel timeline but that never occurred to me /v I saw this on the trending page. I wasn't going to keep watching this until I saw Star in the background. RIP Sourcefed. /v So their is actually a reason fury has to start the avengers initiative according to marvel captain marvel takes place in the 90's with fury in it against the skrull. /v Fury knows about aliens cause of captain marvel /v i disagree with the billions of dollars spent on the avengers initiative  because  they  didn't spend much at all tony payed for almost all of it /v In agents of shield...I know I know. SHIELD already knows about the kree and the inhumans so...avengers needed? /v Im in love with all but one of them. I wont say who. \n\nThat would be awkward. /v This pretty much confirms for me that Fury learns about Skrulls in the 1990s (Capt. Marvel movie), and waits until someone pops up (e.g. Iron Man) to start an initiative towards fighting them. /v Dark Knight Rises should be on here if it's not. Honestly don't know how Bruce Wayne got back to Gotham after the prison escape so quickly. /v Not sponsored by Coca Cola.. /v So glad this isn't another episode of sruoH retfA /v I don't understand the problem with the Back to the Future series. They experiencing time in the last, not the present so they can return to any time they want /v BRING BACK DOES NOT COMPUTE!!!!!!! /v Wait... is that place Poquito Mas? /v Cat-culator! Lol /v Yay for After Hours!!! /v F the cards Dan! /v love this team /v Star! /v you guys are old fat dumb cunts.  unsubscribed. /v Hey guys!! Will you please be the best and help me and my\nfianc win a dream giveaway wedding in our hometown?\n\nAll you have to do is like the video below. As simple as\nthat!! I would really appreciate it :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJs_sculH2g&feature=youtu.be /v well their creepier cause they actually look like clowns, not some American Horror Story looking ones that no kid will ever approach thus leading them to their demise\nOriginal IT > New IT /v One time I saw a clown just driving a Minnie van next to us on the highway in full makeup and all /v super uncool to make an eating disorder joke rhett, it's not edgy it's just insensitive. /v Creepy Chase is the best part of this episode. XD /v Does anyone see the clown picture behind Link the whole episode. /v Shoot I live in Greenville, SC, plz dun kill me clown group /v I wish they'd show us the clown sitting on links lap /v The blonde guy's face reminds me Hercules face! His face structure is super weird /v yall remember when the clown thing was happening? everyone else as so scared and us aussies were like come on, get your bats we are going clown hunting. /v Theres a clown in the background /v Thanks for the bright red circle, I almost couldn't see the clown. /v Did anyone else notice the clown picture in the background? /v I got them all right apart from the last one lol /v Anyone else notice the fact that there was a clown picture on the background /v is it bad i knew the answer tp the serial killer question instantly. any true crime lovers or Murderinos?! /v IT was like the best clown horror movies ever. Worth 2 hours watching. /v Rhett with the hot Suge Knight Commentary. I love it. /v Did anyone else notice the clown picture in the background by the guitars /v Nothing is scarier than 11 year olds engaging in a gangbang to find their way out of a tunnel. /v Collab with Brian Hull. Please. It's his dream. /v THE POSTER IN THE BACK /v Has anyone noticed the picture in the background changes to there current topic? /v why the heck did i click... i freaking hate clowns lol /v Come to the clown festival!!! We all float down here!! /v The clown bullshit gets out of hand there are going to be some dead pennywise mortals. /v I most be psychic because I thought of arbys before link said it. I'm convinced. lmao /v Do you guys ever notice that the picture behind links head always changes based on the topic of the episode. /v john wayne gacy, clown, serial killer and a family man /v Nothing more scary then it /v WARNING:  These guys are the only clowns in this video. /v I saw a picture is a clown in the background that's not usually there /v Look at links hair.... now look to the right.. a clown /v Ever since my sister wanted me to see IT everyone has been talking about clowns /v Did anyone else guess clown fiesta for the second to last one /v I don't know if y'alls seen IT but pennywise is a monster that open up it's mouth to devour children and consume their souls. It literally thinks fear makes the meat tastier. /v Speaking of clowns there's a picture of one right next to one of the small guitars on the right side of the room on the wall /v im watching good mythical morning at night /v wow i didnt know something was scarier than representing fear itself oh wait there isnt you have been fooled /v Am I the only one who noticed the clown photo hanging on the wall? /v Good Mythical Morning Pennywise's catch phrase is YOU'LL FLOAT TOO /v I actually never was really scared of clowns as a kid. I probably liked them. But growing up... umm... not sure if I'll be going up to any clowns now. /v did anyone notice the clown painting in the background /v I hate the laughing in the background sorry but like come on /v These guys are lame and straight up dorks... losers /v I saw it twice /v Honestly, the book was really boring halfway through. The first part (the part involving the kids) was the actual best part of the book. When they become adults, it just drags on for far too long. The remake, however, was amazing all the way through. I didn't feel afraid most of the time, but I felt tense and on edge for the majority of the movie (excluding anything Richie said, that boy is my hero in the movie). /v Pennywise 2017 was scary than all these.  Great movie! /v Link reminds me of Richie from the 2017 It /v omg i remember the whole clown sighting thingy they banned dressing as clowns for Halloween in my school lolol /v I didn't even see the word cane, but for some reason I too guessed head and cane. /v I am watching at night and idc about creppy clowns /v Anyone notice the clown on the wall /v Man guys congrats on 12 million I've been here since the cringe days /v Did anybody see a picture of a clown in the background /v I actually got one right, I can't believe this, I never get any right on these /v I am typing this with my geckos tail /v Did anyone notice that there was picture of a clown in the background /v Hahaha it's actually an adaptation of the book, not a remake. Love you and the video though, and you should go see IT in theaters, you will not regret it /v this is my first 12th season episode for me nice and i have to say it looks like you got sponsers or something /v Hey! I made a bad ED joke today too!\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough I do have one, but I don't know about him. I still laughed.  /v Penny wenny \n\n\n\nSpooky go back in time to the filming of the episode /v I wonder if they gonna talk about Gacy, oh nvm they talkin bout him first...love the new GMM logo /v I'm a rodeo clown this is nuts /v .THIS IS FAKE /v Dude that intro is FIRE /v Clown Lives Matter! /v did rhett really just joke about an eating disorder ohkgugfodjjfdj /v catch phrase was HELLO MUDAFUKA /v Mm. /v Dangit. It was rodeo /v Bring back the old intro!! /v Ballerina Old Ople Babies In Europe Sit. /v Gmm rules /v Your jokes are so edgy today!  /v Chase is amazing wtf /v Gacy /v You gotta grabba to stabba  /v Boobies? /v EsketIT /v The thumbnail is misleading  /v You'll float /v Dislike /v 9 /v #31 Trending  /v Peek peek /v PURGE!?!?! come on man /v We all float down here, georgie.. /v so link has herpes?.. /v Me! I love clonws /v Greenville, SC represent  /v WILL IT HAT!!! WILL IT HAT!!! WILL IT HAT!!! /v I ACUALLY GUESSED RODEO CLOWNING OMG I WAS RIIGGHHTTT /v They all float down the comments section....\n\n\n\n\nGet what I mean? 'It' reference? They all float down here? No? Oh ok... /v *When Link's bottom lip gets herpes it looks like Pennywise's bottom lip.* /v I just came back from a break from them (dont hate me) and I must say wow they have changed /v If people actually knew that this is Stephen King's greatest work. They would actually take it seriously. I wouldn't be surprised if this is his proudest work also. /v Link do you like clown-\nNO /v Guys did you see the clown picture in the back ground if you see it like this comment /v Throat stabber ?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm terrified /v Whalawhat? /v Mark should have played himself,He's barely aged a day /v Tommy Looks Like he just got out of a hospital on Guerrero Street /v Leave your stupid comments in your pocket! /v Also, James Franco close your god damn legs and give that poor old man some god damn room! /v Greg is radiant. My god why didn't they cast him in the film as Greg? /v After seeing The Room and read The Disaster Artist, it is so good to see Tommy, finally on that level. Hanging ou with actual Hollyood stars. /v Tommy Wiseau ascended to a legend. I own a copy of The Room /v James be like : The camera don't move\nBro stop being mean /v Did anyone catch that whenever Jame speaks to Tommy that he speaks slightly like Tommy? /v James is such an asshole /v What's up with Tommy? I wouldn't be surprised if he's an alien or a dishwasher in disguise. Something. /v Wearing sunglasses indoors signals either massive douchbaggery or hides vampire eyes. I truly am not sure which is the case with Tommy. /v Tommy grew up an all-American guy playing football, /v 1:10 You were looking at yourself FOR THE FIRST TIME... that was cruel, Tommy did see The Room movie /v Dude this is hilarious I love James Franco portraying as Tommy he just sounds phenomenal  \nTommy : I like James Francos and brother Dave  /v So is he retarded or something? /v I feel like Tommy is going to slowly take out a neuralyzer out of his pocket for some reason. /v Anyways... I got the results of the test, I definitely have cancer  /v Tommy's face looks like a flattened tether ball /v ...but is Tommy okay with this movie...? /v he can't shake the accent still lol /v I would watch 2 hours of this over the Room anyday /v This movie will be good. And I definitely have breast cancer. /v james franco really cares about his film......gr8 attitude...it will be a hit /v He blind or just a deluxe douche? /v That couch is too small. /v Best movie of the year /v Lol why is James always going Tommy's accent when he talks to him. Is he trying to mess with him or is he just saying that because he thinks he won't understand? /v I love the fact even at the end of this video Tommy is still making up BS as he's always done. /v how Franco opened his legs up and wiseau has to be on the side is sad. /v I think there is something wrong with Tommys eyes he has been wearing those sunglasses for years now /v Ironic that good actor like James Franco couldn't even properly copy (in)famous Hi, Mark! scene. /v Tommy wiseau should be the next doctor who. /v James looking at Tommy like he's  about to rock his world. /v The Room came out 15 years ago and Tommy hasnt improved his English at all. haha /v James Franco imitates that way Tommy speaks at times /v Franco can't help talking like Tommy /v James is honestly sort of a douche in this interview, you can tell Tommy is just going with the flow, but is probably a little pissed. Either way I still have to see this film. /v Tommy is the man. /v l want someone to look at me the way james franco looks at tommy wiseau /v I know one thing: Tommy has absolutely NO idea about the art of filmmaking: from his favourite scene in The Disaster Artist to giving rights based on one of the worst films in Franco's catalogue to... The Room itself /v This is gonna be a great movie! \n\n\nAnyway, how's your sex life? /v I've read the book and every interview with Tommy under the sun but sometimes I wonder if he  is just a guy doing performance art. I know he's almost too weird to be fake but have you seen the website for The Room? I have no idea how anyone less than a genius could create something that looked THAT old! /v I love how james is talking like tommy the entire time lol /v Tommy approves james franco because he wants people to see him as a good looking actor not the joke that he is. /v I like Tommy and think Franco's a dickhead but doesn't Tommy seem coked up? /v Greg is still hot as fuck. /v I'm looking forward to this movie. It doesn't look they're just making fun of him, it's seems to have a lot of heart. I hope it delivers /v Does Tommy knows that he's horrible? /v I'm pretty sure Greg could've played Greg. He still looks very young /v Tommy Wiseau makes James Franco look, for a lack of a better word, normal? /v 4:37 come on Franco why have to put him on the spot like that? LMAO /v James Franco is really taking some leg space /v Look at James man spreading /v Feels weird listening to wiseau without his voice sounding over dubbed like in the movie /v Franco's legs are wide open AF everyone else looks awkward. /v The way the camera movement...I really like it!\nThe camera movement? The camera don't move.\n\nClassic Wiseau moment right there! :D /v Why is he doing his voice at him!? /v James is half way stuck in the ascent /v It looks like he's right there but we all know Tommy Wiseau is on another planet. /v Here it is... you want to watch... the definitive critique of The Room as Oedipus Rex. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs20YlgvvYk /v I do love how Franco isn't taking any of Tommy's shit. I mean, look at his legs. He's all spread out and Tommy is crammed into the side there. Tommy couldn't have liked that. /v It's nice to see Tommy has seemingly warmed up to the guys and the press for this film. At the start it was so obvious he didn't like it and didn't want to be there. /v Tommy seems like a decent guy and its pretty awesome theyre all friends now /v Tommy's being such a good sport about this. /v I wish Tommy and James act together in a movie someday. Coz only James can understand this guy. /v Tommy speaks so funny that end omg.. my favourite part is the swimming pool scene\nReally? Its so random\nYeah I like it. I like the camera movement in there\nCamera movement? The camera doesn't move..  /v I've never seen Tommy Wiseau this normal, it's unusual. He's usually saying nonsense. /v Franco is talking to Wiseau in his native tongue lmao /v I love how Tommy has such weird answers for everything here I now understand why he thought the room was a good idea /v I would kill to see the behind the scenes footage that Markus shot. /v James is still subtly talking like Tommy. /v Super excited for the movie but it's still kind of sad to see Tommy involved in this. I still thinks he believes that his art is good. I get he's fearless and HE is interesting, but his art is NOT good . I really don't think he gets that diaster artist is making fun of his art, not celebrating it. It's like the kid who has a sign on his back and everyone is looking at him but he doesn't get why. /v I love how Tommy actually wants this movie to be made and is just loving every second of it XD /v Wow, this is almost akin to Windy City Heat. /v Tommy thinks a handsome guy like James Franco is perfect because in his mind that's what he looks like. /v Lets just say agreeing with franco moved him.......TO A BIGGER HOUSE /v The Like to Dislike ratio for this video is one of the best I've ever seen. /v Calling it now , it will win an oscar and Wiseau will be given the oscar. It will be amazing /v *new drinking game* \n-drink every time Greg Sestero blinks /v This is awesome /v You're tearing me apart Lisa! /v Greg sestro had so much plastic surgery. /v that brutal handshake /v Wiseau > Nolan /v YES!!!!!!!!!! /v James is a fucking douche /v So great /v Directed by Nicholas cage... /v Hah hah Hah /v Franco is manspreading /v That is some indulging manspread /v Damn, I look good. /v Franco looks normal  compared to tommy lol. /v Dave looks sooo tiny /v Why isn't Greg talking? /v Oh hi, Marcus. /v This is so fucking awkward  /v Dostoyevsky's The Idiot tells the story of the autistic Mishkin, whom people of royalty, high esteem and education mistake to be an enigmatic genius, when he is in fact nothing more than an simple idiot. /v I really don't get why people hate James Franco. He makes odd career choices sometimes with all his indie shit but he seems like a really great guy... loving the deuce and can't wait for this /v No thanks I just want a watch!  /v the tiny screen is gonna make it even harder now to text while driving /v Nice concept but More money to the phone bill by adding  another device. /v $10/month by the big guys.  I bet you Sprint and Teen Mobile will be offering to add the watch for FREE, which I guarantee will bring a new customer base to them. I'm grandfathered in on the old Verizon unlimited.  It's a shame I would have to pay even one CENT more, let alone $10 a month.

Mad love for you man! The whole world is going to know your name soon! /v This music video is telling the story of the rise of Lucifer.

I also love the clip featuring James Arthur singing with the sun rise in the background.. as a James Arthur fan I'm so happy to hear the song.. it's great. /v The UK banging out the tunes as usual.\n\nDoing what we are good at. Making music and eating fish finger sandwiches ! /v nothing special. I hear the same as the others shitty EDM songs. Sometimes I am tired of this type of music. /v the actor look like paul pogba but he is using puma and pogba adidas /v I really love this. You are now my favorite. /v Who's the main dancer? /v Yet another great song from Rudimental. Can't wait to see them again!! <3 /v Felt like I was watching a puma commercial BUT it was absolutely beautiful. /v This song is amazing  /v Been waiting on this video since the day I know they released this.

I was watching live and kept thinking to myself, Dude, just let me see it play out, I don't care if you know. It was VERY impressive though, don't get me wrong, just not how I like to watch games. I could watch the replays if I want to know what happens before it happens, JS... /v never really liked Romo but that's pretty good...dont think even Gruden can do that /v Build the wall. Get him out lol /v It's not a prediction, a good qb just knows how to make a read. /v Romo fn great call. Was so sick of simms pathetic ass ... now get rid of  collingsworth on nbc lol. /v he's going to start a trend now retired nfl players are going to join freaking awesome instead of the ol guys /v I'm pretty sure Romo holds most Cowboys QB records\nNo rings, I know /v He better not give up the cowboys plays /v He should be covering so many more games, you learn a whole lot more compared to the others who mostly just state the obvious. /v Romo absolutely killed it in his broadcasting debut /v He needs to be a defensive coordinator /v BREAKING NEWS: Tony Romo expected to miss 4-6 weeks due to a sore throat. more on this subject as it becomes available. /v I need them lotto numbers /v how is he retired from the sport and still annoying the hell out of me. I can guess run, pass, slot aswell. Its not hard when you watch a lot of film. /v Should become a defensive coordinator. /v I liked it when he asked What do you see here Tony? And Tony Romo calls the play to a Tee. /v Actually kinda ruins the suspense of what is going to happen. /v Tony is gonna be an amazing commentator! /v Joe Buck and TONY ROMO\nJim Nantz and TONY ROMO\nAl Michaels and TONY ROMO\nSean McDonough and TONY ROMO\nThis is how all broadcasting teams should be. /v Honestly don't know how you can hate the guy. He was a gunslinger and super fun to watch. Football is the ultimate team game can't be mad at him for not having a super bowl /v They can't have Romo as a commentator in Madden because he'd just tell the opponent the plays /v Breaking news Romo is out for 5 weeks  with a cold . /v needs to be a coach gd. /v Be cool if he could explain what he sees that makes him predict that stuff. It'd be like a John Madden that's actually useful! /v The real reason why they signed him is not only for his football knowledge but his golfing knowledge as well. Smart. /v Commentators who've interviewed him during his playing days compared his football I.Q. to that of Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. /v The NFL's official youtube page ripped off your video idea and almost copied it exactly, didn't even give any credit to you. /v they ran the ball on 3rd and 2 and blitzed on 3rd and 6 ? i've never seen anything like that, tony is so smart /v Why didnt he do the broncos and charger game on Monday night would been way better /v Horrible title. Why are we surprised that Tony Romo can still read plays? /v Damn, a 14 year quarterback reading plays. \nWHO WOULD OF THUNK? /v As an Eagles fan and proud Cowboys hater. I've always liked Romo, I like the Cowboys players ad people, they just never get respect for the team they play on. I have to say. Romo did an awesome job Sunday. /v Soon the coaches will be wired directly to Romo /v Been a Cowboy fan since the 70's and when I saw Tony was heading to to broadcast booth I told my wife he will be nothing short of fantastic! If you have ever sat back and just listened to him talk about activity on the field, ebb and flow of act and react things done just before the snap (remember how he'd audible consistently) you'd pick up really fast he's reading the field effortlessly...like a heady coach. Parcellls always said he's smart. But many could not see that. Well, now anyone who appreciates smart football will see for themselves. Here's the downside: now I probably need to get GameRewind because he's calling games in the AFC and I think it's brilliant the way he anticipates the action, so if I wanna see that I'll have to pay for it. I love this guy. The paradigm is about to shift on how to analyze live broadcast football. /v A whole season's salary earned in one broadcast. /v Did he predict dak taking his job ? /v 1:14 Gaw Dayum /v Future NFL Head Coach. /v 1:53 That was just spooky /v I hope he doesn't call a Cowboy game. Worried Cowboys fan /v For all those Romo haters from the past that said he was trash....this is what was going on in this guys head every week. He had your #. Future HOF commentator! /v I didn't like him as a player so much, LOVE him in the booth... the way he reacted and talked about the plays... he's not only an expert but a fan! /v This nigga need to be a coach or some shit. Help my bears cheat Romo please /v Tony gonna be a coach /v I could t stand him as a qb but damn he's a great commentator. Holy shit! /v This makes me a little sad, because if Tony's body could keep up with his mind he would have been a force to be reckoned with. /v Toni Homo can suck a big dick... but that was pretty awesome. Finally found his calling /v Why do u start at 2 min left of the 4th? /v If Tony can predict all this, then why couldn't he predict Jessica Simpson becoming fat?  All the signs were there. /v The name Tony Romeo reminds of that funny ass Borderlands animation skit on YouTube  /v I remember Jason Witten saying Tony was a Savant when it came to reading coverages know I get it /v 49ers fan here, Would have liked to see Tony compete these last couple years for a SuperBowl but I'm happy for him. He's taken too much punishment through the years but he's making for a great commentator as well. /v This play is my favorite play. I like is very much.\nHere is some related post https://goo.gl/tdW1R8 /v Tony is the Man fuck all Tony haters y'all faggots don't know shit about football if y'all don't know that Tony going in the hall of fame and he was did his best for the cowboys with what he had it's not fair that Dak just got lucky and got handed the best cowboy team that Tony built finally we get a team together and then he got fucked oh well that's life but iam happy for him he's a real Man he said fuck it and Gave LISTEN CLEARLY yes I said Gave because that is his team let's make it very Clear he didn't have to sit out at anytime he could of said iam ready to go back in sit your ass down boyeee....but that shows he's the Man and loves the team first before himself so FUCK ALL COWBOY AND TONY HATERS. /v What if he calls a playoff game and starts choking on his own spit, this is coming from a Romo fan. /v This is some new kind of broadcasting... someone that knows his shit  /v Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how robot augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23 /v He was a qb. He knows the plays /v Imagine if he was a safety bruh /v Made by Jack Fritz on Twitter! /v I watched the game and he did a great job commentating /v Second note...Amari Cooper only catches difficult passes not the easy ones apparently. If you own him in fantasy trade him for Golden Tate or Doug Baldwin before the rest of your league figures it out as well. atleast those guys will catch the ball and have YAC ( btw i freaking hate Doug Baldwin he's not a #1 receiver) /v Dam he knew all this and still couldn't get it done in the field smh haha /v That's my quarterback! Wouldn't mind if he came back to be the QB's coach for Dallas. /v Not a psychic, just an elite QB with fantastic football knowledge. And I'm an eagles fan /v He's not psychic, Romo's just an experienced QB. He knows all of these plays. /v What is this game? /v Hope he's part of every raider game! Tony's awesome /v Kind of feel bad for Tony. Talent and smarts but couldn't stay healthy. /v Don't ever watch a game of thrones episode with Tony /v Makes me wonder how Cutler would've been lol /v gotta get used to it  /v As an Eagles fan, Romo was fantastic in the booth /v No homo, but I love Romo /v I was skeptical but I thoroughly enjoyed Tony calling this game, got a feeling he is going to be pretty good at this. /v This is better than the usual, The team that scores more should win the game. /v go raiders but tony did a really good job in his first broadcasting game /v Tony is the type of guy that you watch a movie with and he tells you what happens before it happens. /v I'm actually proud my last name is Romo /v Great job Tony. Those predictions bring a different dynamic to the booth /v NFL copied this channel. /v Hey something Tony romo don't suck at. /v Wow that was awesome! /v Money pal money /v Phil simms who ? /v The GOAT /v Man...love this commentary by Romo! /v Future super bowl coach. /v Tony homo /v OMG...he's Stephen FUCKING Hawkings !!!!   (sarcasm: off) /v Next Madden commentator please /v GOLD /v Bill belichik told him /v tony did awesome.  /v Tony romo for madden 19 commentator /v https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuA6NXfSZePanlqpxJJtxSw?sub_confirmation=1 /v Too bad he couldn't predict how bad a quarterback he would be. /v I really really wish cowboys gave romo the starting job dak is really good but I think romo could've taken them farther if he stayed healthy /v Really? Anybody who's watched or played the game can see this stuff. Overloaded to one side = probably gonna run that way.  And for my money, I'd bargain that Romo was fed some of those calls just to increase the hype.  He was that good in the booth but couldn't deliver on the field. But folks are calling him Nostradamus now? Lol /v PLEASEEEEEEEE do your skin care routine /v Nuuuude /v September is fall /v Love your videos, Casey!!!!!!!!! /v UGH!

So many people trying it on my Facebook feed.....but they're some just trying to sell it....so I was just curious! /v i love it when u said that you're either full glam or bare faced, i'm like that too lmao /v Please continue to do videos like this! All of the beauty gurus are so focused on posting videos of reviews on products that they don't even make tutorials anymore and it's discouraging to those of us who want to learn how to create certain looks or recreate them out of inspiration from you guys. You're by far my favorite YouTuber so I'd love to see more! /v Can you tell us if the eyeliner you used in your water line did bleed? /v Im 11, i dont do my makeup, and im not into beauty videos but the makeup looked cute in the thumbnail  /v You have to be my favorite to watch  /v You should your favorite perfumes and not so favorites!!! /v I love the eyebrows lately.

Just look at her shoulders and then her face she looks off. This is the type of girl you give a hug at a party and then look down at your new shirt ruined and caked in makeup. \nNatural beauty over fake any day. \nJust my opinion as a 22 year old. /v I loooooove this look on you!!  /v Can you please do an every day business makeup tutorial? /v Casey please try jabon zote in white for your oily skin, this will hel you so much please , please, please try it you can buy it at amazon you will save so much money on skin care, you can even use it to wash your make up brushes. /v Love your videos so much!

Also I love my abalone tenderised then sliced thin and flash fried for 20 seconds with lemon, salt, pepper and butter. /v be careful for drop bears whilst you're over here /v I live in Australia /v I was shocked when Abalone, or Paua (As we call it in New Zealand) was the most expensive dish because it is something that I have had several times. I guess fishing is such a huge part of the culture here and the native sea life is abundant (although there are strict laws around fishing and gathering)  that I took it for granted! Maybe my family could try a DIY recipe and share it together. /v You pretty much might as well stay in the USA. Because you are not experiencing Australia, or its real people or its real food by only visiting the city. Its the most Americanized part of Australia. /v What does abalone taste like?\nIt's seafoody, flavoursome, a real mouthful\nCould you be any vaguer lol /v Petition for adam to get a full meal /v Why do that crab look like the Crab on Moana  /v They should do sandwiches next episode /v i'd def go 4 the oysters /v I visited Australia but I went to goldcoast /v Yo what's that sweet song at 10:00 ? /v Yay Cantonese cuisine, good to see something in my homeland get some love :3 /v WHAT SONG IS FROM 10:18 THAT SONG IS FROM MY CHILDHOOD I MUST KNOW /v Straight guy but I'm in love with Adam.

I would just stick w/ the mid-level prices. almost same taste as the gourmet crap, but far less expensive. /v The sea version of an astronaut so a scuba diver   /v Who else is Australian and was kinda cringing when he was naming the cities ughhhhh one of my pet peeves is people who don't say words right /v Hope to see you guys in the barossa valley for your wine! /v What kind of camera do they use? /v go to Philly and do 3 Philly cheesestakes /v Is there a way I can just subscribe to Worth It? /v The way they say Melbourne and Brisbane make me cringe so much  /v So excited you were all in Australia! Hope you had a great trip, and enjoyed the land down under :D /v I ate an oyster once. It was traumatic. /v lol $42 for a grilled crawfish (I know there's a little bit more on the plate but still...) /v If I ever become insanely rich, I'll still stick to crab legs and sushi for expensive seafood. Not paying $200 for 1 plate of... fish pancake. /v 7:10 get yourself a friend that protects your food /v Ummm, why didnt Andrew know the Captial of Australia? /v Did anyone else spot Mueselk in the background /v Hilarious moments! \n\nAndrew: you have to be the ocean be the ocean version of an astronaut to do that.\nSteven: so, Scuba diver?\nAndrew: ...yeah..uh..\nHAHAHHAHA /v Would be so cool if they went to Asia and compared cheap street foods to fancy restaurants /v This is why I'll never eat lobster... most sea food is cooked alive or freshly killed. I can't deal with that. /v They go all the way to Australia for seafood but stay in LA for barbecue  /v I live in melbourne /v Felt like slapping that last chef... If you cant even describe the taste of your food, u dont deserve to be a chef... /v adam is the cinnamon roll we need /v Andrew: HOLY SH*T THAT'S AMAZING\nSteven: Whooooooo- That's the best oyster I've ever had!\nAdam: *nods* /v Do a video for Canadian Poutines!! /v This show makes me wanna spend my paycheck on food /v Why hasn't this show gotten old yet? I mean that in the best way possible, love this show!! /v what's the music @ 4:57? /v andrew's so mean i thought the intro was totally whelming /v Please tell me you went to Attica /v You guys should come to Florida and do food that's made with Gator meat. Which is delicious! /v I love my country /v So jealous that they get to eat all this delicious food from all over the world! /v Duh if you want to eat the real seafood culinary, go to asian countries then /v I am on a seafood diet, I see food and I eat it... /v I hate how Americans say Australia /v Cannot believe you went to Autralia and didn't do a worth it episodes for meat pies.  Also when are you going to have an episode where cameraman Adam leads the crew to try delicacies.  It's been all work and no fun for him for nearly three whole seasons. /v CIRUSS IS SO MEAN. They killed that thing while it was still alive!!!! I feel so bad for it. /v Last one was just a waste of money /v We are in Melbern \n\nThat is an American for you. /v Song at 4:57 ? Thank you! /v When a youtube video seems like a TV show is it a good thing or bad thing? really don't know. /v -Melboorne um its mel-bun Melbourne /v How they say Melbourne  /v Do meat pies /v $10 vs $1000 weed /v I head cantonese words (I speak cantonese) /v Snot rocks  /v What?? comparing seafood is like comparing dessert /v Go to Brisbane /v Urnge Clabs he says /v wait r they still here? /v come to tassie! /v Food poisoning. /v Lmao Brendan Savage /v Lobsters are heat changing mugs /v For when swiss fondue? /v Do 1$ food poisoning vs 500$ food poisening\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd plz dont recover /v OYSTERS CLAMS AND COCKLES /v seeing andrew smile completes me /v Make adam eat more /v Btw, its MelBEN not MelBURN /v yay for nba2k18 ad with Lonzo Ball /v Adam is depressing asf /v How bout cheap exotic food vs expensive exotic food (Noma) /v Oyster oi /v I love this new ELDW foundation the finish is so pretty!! /v I'm so excited for you that youre finally going on accutane, you deserve your clear skin and i cant wait for your transformation  /v Awesome review!  I think I'm gonna give the Estee lauder foundation a try.  Love this series of videos. /v I love me some emo. /v how often do you do the 15 Days of Foundation? /v I bought that Lottie London foundation stick when I was just starting my make up phase. It nearly put me off for life!! It's soooooo bad! /v Can you do a top 5 fav foundations of all time? /v This shade looks almost like your skin tone! /v You're my hero /v This foundation made your skin look flawless and so healthy! This one is a keeper /v I can't wrap my head around the fact that such high price foundation doesn't have a pump. For that money you should definitely get a pump! /v Day 11 already! Love your videos. /v The liquid Lottie London foundation I heard is much better! /v I would love to see you review the Dior Forever foundation. I think since you have issues with longevity.. this one could work for you :) /v I have been on acutaine for a few months now and I went from having extremely oily skin with cystic acne to a few regular blemishes here and there (still not done with taking the pills) but my face is so dry now! I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though! /v Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything). /v FILM TUBE new Channel Frequency  /v How do you keep your teeth so white AND still drink coffee?! Taylor teach me your Taylaa ways!!! /v I'm newer here. Does anyone know if she has her eyebrows microbladed? Even before make up they looked very dark and filled in. Just curious  /v Curious, but does make up make ppl break out easier? /v Your trending girl! Thats pretty awsome, also thanks for trying out another foundation instead of making this a short fail vid. Your hard work is def. Appreciated and acknowledged!! /v Does anyone know if Taylor has tried the Double Wear Light? \nSharon Farrell here on YouTube says it's her favorite. She's lighter complected and has oily skin. Thinking Taylor might like it also...?\nBtw if you don't know Sharon, go check her out. She's a awesome! Does amazing vlogs too. I feel like a lot of Taylor's subscribers would like Sharon. Good for the smart, more mature audience. /v i thought this was jaclyn hill in the thumbnail /v I think this might be one of my favorites in 15 days of foundation  /v Are you gonna do a video on fenty beauty foundation? I wanna know what shade you are /v You're literally trending rn I love it /v #25 trending when I came here to watch! /v Girl! You're trending #25\nAlso that Estee Lauder foundation looks great!. /v This foundation looked so pretty on you!! I gotta try it!! /v love how that foundation looks on your skin  I want to purchase it now  /v Why does it have to end!?!?  #snapchatfam /v The way you felt about that stick foundation is how I feel about the Fit Me stick foundation. Does everything you just described. /v Wonderful review! The new Estee Lauder foundation looks beautiful! I liked the suttle shade difference too (for fair skin)! I'm definitely going to check it out. Thank you!  /v I love Double Wear. It's my holy grail. I definitely want to try this out. What was going on with the Lottie London one /v One of the best shade matches ever!! /v Your videos are often the best part of my day! So glad that even though your audience grows and you are so busy outside youtube, your spark, humor and dedication to making quality content never fade <3 /v You are very honest and I love that about your channel. Keepem comin /v I loveee how much work you put into your channel  /v The face you make when you get trolled 14:54 /v I was so excited to see this idea up early! /v I kinda like the way you look better with medium coverage. It makes your skin look more natural I think. /v the stick foundation looked drier than the sahara desert. wow. /v That's so weird (the Lottie foundation) cause I have both of there's. The stick foundation is one of my favourite foundations plus it covers a lot! \n\nThough I do have fairly unblemished skin. /v Really hope you'll be reviewing the new peach foundation from Too Faced! /v is it sad I won't watch anyone else's review on the fenty foundation until I see Taylor's on day 13 cause her opinion's the only one I really care about /v Yes on Trending!!!!! That's great Taylor!  /v I am so ready for the fenty review!!! I know just about everyone I watch has enjoyed it but I'm still not sure if I wanna purchase it until I see the review here! If I can trust anyone's review 100% is from the baerrito fam. /v Please review the new FENTY foundation!!!! /v You should try out the nars velvet matte skin tint!!!!! /v You can apply the Este Lauder nude with ur finger tips /v Thataylaa, try using a thin layer of the original DW. After, apply DW Nude. You will get beautiful coverage and proper hydration!!! Although you go through a crap ton of the DW nude, at least it builds without caking if used alone. Tell me what you think off the combo of original and nude!!! /v I wish beauty gurus wouldn't put wow so good! Or Fail! In the thumbnail because it makes you not want to watch it because you know the outcome. /v girl, do more drugstore foundations! I don't have the budget lmao  /v I'm kind of disappointed that I can't get a #15daysof foundation shirrrrrrt but at the same time I understand she's doing something biggggg /v omg your video is 15th on the trending page!! Coincidence?? Love you girl  /v Yay trending! You go girl!  /v You need to post the Fenty Beauty foundation review NOW you're number 21 on trending now, and you could get even more views and subscribers that you honestly deserve. The fenty beauty reviews are hyped right now and highly viewed. /v Literally just got my sister addicted to 15DoF and she's not currently in bed at 1am watching your videos from January she's went that far back #newbaerittos X love u girl xx /v @thataylaa your eye twitches because of a lack of zinc. If you take a daily vitamin that says it has zinc in it and he still twitch then you need more zinc than that. Just wanted a while not every day. /v Test fenty Beauty foundation bbg!! /v Trending woo /v So happy you're trending!!  /v #25 on trending!!!

GET IT GURL!!! /v #18 on trending!! /v Hi Taylor love your channel watch your videos daily! :) I must say the first foundation was crap , but I have to say am I the only one who didn't like the Estee foundation on her ??? I thought it showed off her texture way too much and her skin looked uneven in color and it also made her pores show so much more with this foundation. I've seen plenty other foundations you tried look absolutely beautiful.on your skin but this one for me didn't do it for you . /v Sub to my channel trying to reach 1 sub /v EW ! This is why I have trust issues  /v Your skin looks bad. I would NOT put ANYTHING on it. Eat pineapple and get some SUN! It will help kill the the acne causing bacteria and smooth your skin out. Fresh cut pineapple every other day for two weeks. And no makeup for two weeks.\n\nStart with that and you will need a lot less foundation!! /v honestly, that lottie linda foundation was trash... kinda like my ex.  but you honestly looked sick, but by the end of the video you looked fabulous!!  im so sad this season of 15 DOF is almost over  /v Slag /v If your natural hair is blond, why do your eyebrows grow in black? /v You're trending! So happy to see more people watching you! You deserve it  /v Goddd I love your videosss!!! /v Please please please pluck your eyebrows before filming, they look so messy! /v ALL THESE FUCKIN RETARDED MAKEUP TUTORIAL YOUTUBERS NEED  TO EITHER DIE OR GET OFF THE MOTHERFUCKING TRENDING FEED. /v I miss the old kanye\nChop up the beats kanye. /v Thank you for this. Thank Kanye for all of this. /v I have problem choosing wether Graduation or 808 and Heartbreaks to be my favorite album /v Graduation is great, but id didn't change music, 808's and heartbreak did, /v My favorites are Champion and Glory. Stronger is overrated /v Genius has a YouTube channel?? How did I not know this before today! Subscribed  /v everything i'm not made me everything i am  /v I think the biggest effect Kanye West ever had on my life was that he showed me there was in fact, actually one person on this earth I actually despise more than Taylor Swift. Then Beyonce just kinda shrugged him off and congratulated Taylor Swift. I see why so many people like Beyonce, she is a class act. Still don't get why so many like the other 2 though... /v I bought a CD back in 2007 for the cover and kept it for the music. /v I wanna see one of this for every album, specially for mldtf /v I thought thay meant that they played his music at an Graduation.... /v lmao when's he gonna get lil wayne to play guitar on his album? /v I know God put you infront of me .How the hell could you front on me ?!! /v i was lowkey sad when it ended hahaha i was interested in what they had to say for post graduation /v Spoilers: it didn't change music /v Forget the new kanye i need old kanye /v His sampling game on point /v Anyone weird enough to like fish dicks is bound to be considered eccentric thus genius by the average person.\nAlso, no genius would marry a Kardashian or leave an insurmountable volume of shit that comes out of his mouth aka brain. /v #46 on trending? it's LIT /v Unfortunately Kanye and Wayne different versions of hip hope and rap has lead to the mumble crap we see today with nothing but beats and autotune carrying entire wongs /v The dude is a musical genius, i just wish he wasnt an egotistical, autistic, arrogant piece of shit human being yah know? /v Does anyone else notice Kanye's jacket in the vid look like the black parade jackets /v Just gonna say it's refreshing to see a YouTube comment section where people aren't shitting on Kanye. Y'all wavy. /v This is a nice format! Can Genius have a channel for rock & metal? /v to bad he gave travis the throne /v the greatest album ever /v Do a video on different beat producers love for Chrono Trigger samples. I hear it everywhere in rap. /v that shit is classic! /v Graduation is my favorite album by Kanye west /v KANYE NARCISSIST WEST D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E-D his mom by what he said vs. what he became...a MONSTER at approx. 5:00 mark #Disgrace /v his best album hands down /v kanye is the most consistent rapper ever , release one track , instant classic. /v I miss the old Kanye /v Am i the only one who likes drunk and hot girls?  /v when vox already covered this about 2 weeks ago... /v College dropout is his best album doe... graduation is cool... but it's not college dropout. The production alone makes it a classic.... one of my top 3 albums ever /v My Favourite hip hop album of all time /v I adore Kanye, but I recently discovered his developed style was just birthed from copying Kid Cudi lol. Was sort of disappointing.\nGraduation was the last original thing Kanye made, even though Dark Fantasy is his best work. /v You know you're a legend when your arguably worst album is a calssic ! /v I'm still listening to graduation  /v 50 told me go ahead switch your style up, and if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up. /v I could guess that 80% of people who own yeezys don't even know graduation. Really sad to think /v 2007 me: there's no way Kanye can do better than this \n2010: Jesus fucking Christ /v did he say dived instead of dove? /v I miss the old Kanye... /v How many people were singing and dancing the whole time this video was on?  /v As much as I loved Graduation I really think you should have done a video of how 808s changed music instead. /v Wishing kanye releases more music soon! Heard his new album might be called turbo graphx 16? /v Good Morning is the best song on the album IMO /v I'm a god /v Flashing lights, can't tell me nothing, Stronger best songs on the album /v *i was still changing my diapers* /v AND I WONDER.. /v You already know /v Still listen daily /v 50 on trending /v Kanye is ahead of time /v wasn't better than Curtis /v What does the one person in the audience yell at 4:08? /v Graduation is like 2-3 but MBDTF is just the best album of all time  /v This album made me understand why other people feel so connected to music. My favourite album (behind good Kid M.A.A.D city). BTW good morning > congratulations for a graduation song. /v This is not a mishap. /v kayne is an asshole and he sucks. /v Yall copies Pitchforks video /v I miss stronger /v Who is Kanye? /v i still hate kanye west /v GOAT!!!!!!! /v shoutout to daft punk /v Great video my friend /v I liked Drunken Hot Girls. /v MBDTF tops Graduation. /v KANYE IS THE FUCKING GOAT DONT YOU FUCKERS FORGET #freeye /v Kid cudi helped influence his sound too /v Can we pls get cruel winter already /v Imo the greatest rapper ever /v 808s more influential than graduation /v Nxt time jst background commentary /v Damn this makes so much sense omg /v This is awesome /v Kanye West is the greatest ARTIST of the 21st century /v Kanye was the core of hip hop in the 2000s. His creativity literally changed the game. Like, what fucking rapper in 2007 would collab with Chris Martin? All his songs on Graduation are GOLD for that time /v Kanye West is the goat and there's no dispute /v When this album came out, it never left my car's CD player for over 7 months. The fact that he made the beats made the songs more appreciative. /v Man that album was awesome /v Everyone always ignores The Glory, that was my favorite song in the album. /v To this day kanye's most overlooked and underrated album. /v Kanye was light years before his time. Everything being produced now he did almost half a decade ago. Kanye is the GOAT /v 808's and heartbreak I think really changed the game. And kinda paved the way to bring about a lot of the artist we have today. /v Greatest artist of the past 20 years /v 1. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy \n2. The College Dropout \n3. Graduation \n4. Late Registration \n5. The Life of Pablo \n6. 808's & Heartbreak\n7.  Yeezus \n\nMy Personal Taste \n\n1. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy \n2. Graduation\n3. The Life of Pablo\n4. Late Registration \n5. The College Dropout\n6. Yeezus \n7. 808's and Heartbreak /v yes he is extremely talented, but he doesn't have to be so smug about it. I just wish he would just tone down his narcissistic tendencies and just be himself for a change. I don't. hate Kanye West for I am a secretly a huge fan of  his music. /v One of my favorite albums definitely a classic  hes the   GOAT ... lyrically top 5 /v I listen to all that trap shit now days. But it's something special when I can listen to a bunch of bull shit and the only real hip hop I have on my phone is Kanye West albums all the way up to run away. His messages in his songs are so real man. I'm a truck driver, so I'll put it on shuffle and my whole day will change emotionally. Also I have Lauren Hill, Eryka Badu, some floetry, etc.... I love good music. But now days it's dying to me. /v Graduation is still my favorite Kanye album...amazing front to back /v For the 2010s, the top 5 most influential and culture changing albums/projects in no particular order are My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Take Care, House of Balloons, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and Channel Orange. Changed music as a whole. /v true artist /v Absolute classic. Beautiful album. /v Greatest rapper alive, fuck lil wayne. /v It's not rly that original it's heavily inspired by kid cudi /v When you try to loose virginity. /v when that booty so big u bounce back like /v I've made y'all angery yeah /v This dude out here trying to deliver the Krusty Krab pizza /v He making sure to test out the iPhone.

Nope. You were just a sucky candidate. /v She really is crazy isn't she? Wow! /v Back off you creep!! Hillary talking to herself in the mirror /v  Hillary Clinton Speeks ..... Ugh....she's speaking again? Ok I admit it, she sure is strong woman, she wants to get right back out there and play the victim again! /v She still doesn't get the point why she wasn't elected. /v Just so classy to make everything about you AGAIN. I remember BERNIE saying to VOTE FOR HER! /v This is the face of the Democrat party. The dumbest candidate EVER to run for ANY office. She stood for nothing....she did nothing....and she got NOTHING! /v Former first lady of a rapist.. Ffs look at that fake laugh. /v This woman is so delusional,  if you want the reason, LOOK IN THE MIRROR! /v Everything anyone could hate about an elitist. /v That dislike to like ratio though  /v WHAT HAPPENED??? TRUMP HAPPENED /v Take a look at the dislikes and then think about why you're not President. /v That woman is nuttier than a fruitcake (HRC, libs/leftists/progressives - I'm aware you're so open-minded that your brains have fallen out and you have to be told everything). I am SOOOOOO glad she's not POTUS. My God - America would have been destroyed. Thank you, God, for DJT - thankyouthankyouthankyou. We definitely dodged that bullet. Remember hearing about Hitler wanting to destroy all of Germany when it was clear he lost the war? Yeah. That would have been America under that psycho HRC. /v Anyone with common sense check the dislike nobody want her for president there's a reason why she lost I wasn't Russia /v She's like THE WORST ANNOYING tissue stuck to your foot, ONLY, SHE NEVER EVER GOES AWAY! Pls leave! HILLARY FOR PRISON-2017! /v BOO HOO BOO HOO ( a Clinton supporter ) HIP HIP HOORAY HIP HIP HOORAY!!! An American supporter2020 TRUMP /v The constant hate against white people is why Hillary lost.\nThe constant hate against Conservatives is why Hillary lost.\nThe constant hate against America is why Hillary lost.\n\nThe constant hate spewed by the Left is why Democrats will continue to lose.  Keep it up, Lefties, you're destroying yourselves, and the world could not be happier for it. /v I wonder how many people watched the video from beginning to end before posting a comment. /v Total BS  Hillary just go away /v This is the reason she lost, blaming everyones for her problems. /v What else is there to know? The title of her new book already has an answer: What Happened? Hillary Rodham Clinton. /v Hilary didn't do her search, did she?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elected_and_appointed_female_heads_of_state_and_government /v every time i check back here there are fresh comments but the view count, like/dislikes, and comment count are stalled /v I honestly don't think Ms. Clinton lost because she was a woman. I think it has more so something to do with her being the DC type that just tells people what they wanna hear, and not really meaning it. /v She's eating her guilt away... lol\nBoo Freaking Hoo... get over it you sad sack. /v Do they not understand? /v Everybody saying that he is unfit to be a president and unqualified.... The ONLY requirements: 35+ years old, and born in The US. /v what happaned\n\n\n\nhillary clinton is what happened. she isn't the first person to lose an election, and she wasn't supposed to be president. nobody is supposed to be president except for the person that wins the election.\nshe lost the election because she kept insulting half of the country. and she thinks white nationalists are bad, so if you're a white person and you love your country then you're a terrible person in her mind. and if you think about it, that's pretty much an admission that she hates her country or else she herself would be a white nationalist. so don't vote for hillary because she hates america. /v The more this woman speaks the worse off the democrat party is. Preach on Hillary, blame everyone but yourself. /v She is dead wrong about people not being offended by her 'deplorable' comment.  I am a middle American working woman who used to be a Democrat.  Mr. Trump offered solutions while she offered global promises. I was highly OFFENDED that she lumped me into a basket of 'deplorables'. Her NOT understanding how that affected many Americans is the reason she lost.  Until she understands that she will continue to blame everyone but herself.  I didn't hear her accepting any blame here. Jane Pauley ends the interview by saying she did, but she didn't.  She lost because she had nothing to offer, no hope or promise of a change for those of us who struggle to pay the bills.  She promised all kinds of things and all kinds of money to everyone and everywhere in the world.  To everyone but 'us'.  Trump's not perfect by any stretch, but at least he offered a chance for change and to make Amercia great again.  And if you already thought it was great...you probably voted for Hillary.  For most of us, it has not been great for awhile. /v This washed up old hag takes ZERO responsibility for the loss she blames progressives, Comey and the media then the has the audacity to claim she's the embodiment of the Democratic party, really? She's a corrupt corporate shill nobody likes republican, independent or democrat! /v It's so obvious Killary paid for the spot on MSM to promote her book. That's why I hate MSM, they're like cheap hookers; they'll do anything for a couple of dollars. /v negligence doesn't require intent. That's opposite. /v You lost because Democrats were disgusted by you, that's why thousands didn't vote. /v Tfw u play victim when u dont get what u want /v It is Hillary Clinton who does not live in reality. She lives in a bubble of incessant dog-ate-my-homework excuses about her own incompetence and gross negligence regarding matters of grave importance, which happen to be real: national security, and the conduct of American embassies abroad. She clings to the nauseating presumption that she has sheer class entitlement to rise, by nepotism, up some kind of government corporate ladder. If anything is Putinesque, this is, not to mention the endless race-baiting cultural Marxist lingo the Democrats incessantly borrow from Russia and Mao. To top it off, she STILL considers half of America to be deplorable. \n\nIt is the Democrats who both historically and today cannot give up the race-baiting. They insist that race and other irrelevant categories of social science are the be all and end all of being. This merely exposes their stupidity. Not insensitivity, though it certainly is that. But stupidity. Absolutely disqualifying for high office. /v Hillary is such a c#nt. /v you should never be overconfident. and in the end, well, the Dems abandoned white people - and white people abandoned them. /v ... expecting history being made. Note to Jane Pauley: History was being made no matter who won the presidency. You could say that history was made because Trump is the first billionaire president. Maybe it's more accurate to say a first-in-history was being made with a first female president /v She probably refused to sit down with a man /v Pure evil. How this person could win the popular vote is mind boggling. She is the epitome of all that is wrong with politics and the country in general....along with Obama, Soros, etc. Anyone who voted for her should feel immense shame and regret. This isn't even politics or left vs. right. This is a sad disgusting human being. /v She looks like she ate 2 pounds of chinese food and a 6 pack before she went to bed /v Sunday Morning used to be a good show.  But liberals ruin everything. /v Guys Guys you don't understand, it does not matter what she says or does, the basic fact is It was her turn XD /v I cant get enough of all those blubbering women's looksof shock /v Donald Trump should thank Hillary a million times for fulfilling his dream of being POTUS. He would have never have won against Bernie Sanders. /v Omg, what a crybaby. Hillary played dirty and she lost. Stop bitching about it, you were not liked amongst Bernie supporters, people saw you as the career politician you are, that lies and cheats her way into a potential position she thinks she deserved. You are a hack and fake person. /v I wish Hilary won....sad trump is president....now Ima go back to Mexico /v Holy Crap that lady just does not get it. /v And this is why you won't ever be elected.\n\nI've no problem with a female president, but i have a problem with corrupt liars running for president. You're less likable than Donald Trump, Helllooooooo doesn't that tell you something? You couldn't beat a literal clown. No one wanted you, we want a female president with MORALS and INTEGRITY, of which you have NONE. /v ...because you'd be in jail. /v Literally the world's biggest LOSER /v As a German, I really have the most tender feelings for Killary Klinton. She came, she saw, he died (Col. Gaddafi, that is).  Turning Libya more or less single handedly into a failed state and opening the flood gates from 2011 on for all of them well meaning refugees from Nigeria to Bangladesh. That woman is really an achiever.  The good people of Italy will probably root for her also. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgcd1ghag5Y.\n\nHEHEHEHEHEH! Kudos to her sex pest husband too!\n\nUnbelievable... /v She'll NEVER accept any responsibility for losing the election. Typical Democrat /v One of the worst rated videos ever, at 1:8. No one is really believing these people. At least we know she won't run again. /v A book commercial disguised as a news report.  Not fooling anyone. /v Nothing but a total rewriting of history.  Complete garbage. /v The repetitive liar said in the debate she would accept the results if she lost. She has been whining and blaming everybody ever since.  A devious liar all the way around /v You've GOT to be kidding me. This is the most pre-pubescent emotional tantrum like reaction I have ever seen from a human that is supposed to be an adult. MEDIA STOP GIVING THIS WOMAN A PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO PREACH! Want to actually help? Focus your media money and attention on any of the MANY female candidates for the future presidency. Oh, but I guess thats too gosh dang logical. Better to whine and suck clinton koolaid. /v She blames white people...and still doesn't understand why she was steamrolled /v I had not drafted a concession speech     That mindset is what made her lose. /v Im a victim. It was the Macedonian hackers and racist white people that ruined it for me. /v Hillary is the kind of person that'd shut Mortal Kombat off because she was losing /v Is going on tour as the victim comedian what the heck is this witchgina saying what a has been. Hahahaha it's funny because it's true yes /v Thank god I voted for Trump /v The news that suppprts her gets 23k dislikes and 3k likes by weirdos  /v Will you please just quit talking because no one cares what you have to say lol /v By the way...why is this entire election being framed as something stolen form her???? It's a weird narrative. This wasn't a coronation that was usurped. Her name was on the ballot along with others. The presidency didn't belong to her. /v Jesus Christ. How do you not see that you're the reason you lost? You didn't even fathom the idea you could lose so you never wrote a concession speech and you bought a house in DC? /v CBS is FAKE NEWS and guilty of sedition........pull the plug on these TRAITORS .... /v Prison is where she needs to be. /v She's crooked as a three dollar bill  /v That like to dislike ratio tho /v P R O P A G A N D A /v Hillary lost because she was out of touch with the country and in bed with the hated crooked media. /v Lmfao she just cant accept the truth. She dug her own grave. Shes even throwing sanders under the buss when he told the left to vote for her after her and the DNC cheated him out of any real chance he had at all. /v shouldn't she be saying this from prison and to all her cohorts in with her /v I am completely certain that this woman would have had us at war with Russia by now. /v Hm there's no way those dislikes could get any higher, must be the damn Russians hacking youtube. /v This person has to be one of THE most narcissistic, self absorbed, self important people on the planet. Zero self accountability. Zero responsibility. You are a sociopath HRC! You are a criminal! You are a murderer! You are greedy! You are shameless! You are heartless! You are evil! You are a pathological liar! America doesn't want you! Deal with it! You are a horrible horrible human being! You and your raping piece of garbage husband! America is BURNED OUT on the Clinton crime family! It will be a happy happy day when that corpse of a husband and you are dead and gone! And I truly hope it's a looooong and painful deteriorating crawl to the grave for both of you! /v Let's not forget, she ruined Bernie's chance to be the candidate, along with her unfair party. Hillary is being paid a lot of money for these books, interviews, speeches, etc... /v Hillary Roduptheass Clinton. /v MsM sucks donkey balls. /v LOCK HER UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v Roaches always return /v Kick start your broom wicked witch....you are WORTHLESS. /v Peeps, immigrant That was  really  crazy$vides begin  :3 /v Sweet liberal tears yyummyyyyy!!!! /v Looks like Hillary's popularity is a non-partisan issue.

Not to mention, the superficial cuntery she worships, that is Fashion Week? /v One of the few red pilled celebrities out there that I can respect. I've noticed for awhile he's been very jaded at the world and the way the movie industry is because if you think about it, the film industry is a very weird and dark place to work for /v A comedian has become no one...valar morghulis /v man Jim took some psychedelics thats for sure. /v Seriously this was beautiful. I get it Jimmy boy, I get it! /v The fuck is this amazing man talking about? lol /v Jim Carrey SPEAKING THE TRUTH ABOUT HOLLYWOOD lmao  /v SHE has NO clue ! ha ! /v Hi world people. I just wanna say that I just loooove Jim words, but I even love more that all comments here are supporting him, not just because I'm agree with him or because is Jim Carrey or whatever, but because people get him and totally understands what he's trying to say even with the girl trying to minimize him. This brings me a little more hope for the world. \n\nSorry for my not-expert-english jaja. Regards from Venezuela. /v When he edibles kick in. /v He definitely believes in something greater outside our perception of attainable peace! /v He knows its all a meaningless illusion. All genius creative people come to this conclusion. Just saw 'End of the tour,' about David Foster Wallace. This writer sums up the meaninglessness of awards ceremonies. 'Is this who we are? A binge-watching, technologically-sedated mass with an almost religious conviction that instant celebrity and spiritual contentment are one and the same. Is this who we are? is a question that will not be getting asked on this years red carpet. The questions asked will remain the same empty, salivating ones that were asked on last years red carpet: Tell us about that designer outfit you have on, how surprised were you to be nominated, and of course who do you think will win? We already know what the stock answers will be: Its such an honor to be here. A dream come true. Wish me luck. The End of the Tour ends with a plaintive cry into this celebrity-obsessed wilderness. ' http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-callaci/the-oscars-get-it-all-wrong_b_9015408.html \nSo Jim Carey isnt crazy, he's just on the same page as every one else who's realised the meaninglessness of entertainment obsessed culture. we're gonna have to develop some real machinery inside our guts... to turn off pure, unalloyed pleasure. Or, I don't know about you, I'm gonna have to leave the planet. 'Cause the technology is just gonna get better and better. And it's gonna get easier and easier... and more and more convenient and more and more pleasurable... to sit alone with images on a screen... given to us by people who do not love us but want our money. And that's fine in low doses, but if it's the basic main staple of your diet, you're gonna die. - David Foster Wallace /v Wtf...\nExistential crisis?  \nHe has become quite an ideologue after all... /v He just owned that girl hahahaha damn /v I want to believe it but he's only maybe half right. We do matter. If we didn't we wouldn't even be. Someone or something needs us. So tell that whatever if it needs me... I need it or you to give back what i want /v Hmm...he might be just trying to get with her... /v He sounds off the only thing off is the title of this video /v jim carrey is on another level of thinking its too much for these braindead interviewers he did some trolling on her funny it was /v I actually respect him MORE now. People nowadays are foolish, and he's one of the few who truly acknowledges what we came to be. /v Get past your group hatred of the fashion industry, and realize how odd his outlook is. He's saying that life is inconsequential and that people aren't real. /v got to agree, why do people care about this dumb shit /v I don't believe in icons...... /v I LOVE YOU JIM CARREY! /v You can do what you want to do..........in living color /v He's saying that there is no me or you. We are all energy. We are all one. /v Jim is reaching astronomical levels of wokeness /v Even though he may have a point he sounds like an ass. What kind of drugs is he on? /v Damn he got ahold of some strong ass shrooms. /v Well , he just telling the truth about Hollywood , everything is just fake /v Good for Jjim Crrey.  Icons are stupid and people aren't important as they think. Biggest news is none of those icons have done a damn thing to make a better world, /v Wow!! Let me tell you that you exist, that you are who you are because God decided to create you, you exist because of love, love that emanates all around you, from your family, from your friends, even people you don't even know. You are so special you don't realise how much, because you live for a purpose, for something important, for the good of humankind and all the existence that surrounds us. Don't let the teachings of The New Age fool you. The Lord can guide you to peace and thru love, Jesus Crist is the answer. /v Wow... his skin got all wrinkly. All those bizarre facial contortions he'd make finally caught up with him because he's not that old. The so-called 'rubber-faced' actor... well, not anymore. /v LOL! Jim reveals Hollywood and it's BIZARRE obsession with itself; Stand up job. P.S. Do another Ace Ventura...Pleaseeeeee.. /v He knows that we don't own this world........Raptilian aliens do  /v jimcarrey.exe has stopped working. /v Dude is losing it. /v Anyone else see FRED carpet? /v Omg, she sucks. \nLOVE YOU JIM. /v 0:01 circles prey /v Jim is scaring me, this shit is freaky /v She mindfuck that poor superficial reporter /v Jim Carreys conscious...... R u??  /v Good trolling LOL /v She annoys me. /v Jim Carrey the realest nigga in hollywood! /v OMG, what drugs does he do lol /v good /v She looks so Fucking triggered /v He definitely knows something we dont.  /v red pilled af /v Jim  /v Hahaha when he just randomly started singing /v Jim Carrey is Morpheus /v Nihilist Jim Carrey is my favorite meme now /v So fucking redpilled /v LOLOLOL! He's awesome! /v Icons =  /v Truman Show go Jim /v i fucking love him omg haha /v TGSNT.TV /v Zrozumialem tylko to ,ze PiS jest super partia w Polsce...i trzyma z daleka od polskich granic nachodzcow.... bravo  /v he's fucking high or something /v God bless you pastor Lee. For once, and American who calls himself a Christian, actually living out the Gospel of Christ in a way that matters and is relevant to what's happening in our world today. Rare to see among Americans. /v The New York Times you are best news paper. I request you to one news write about Burma Buddhist terrorists  persecution at Muslim's. /v I hope and pray for those that don't have power and lost their homes. /v Nice Video! It deserves more attention - check out: U 2 B Z O N E .C O M - It will help you :) /v Storm was over exaggerated /v My God...I didn't think it would get that bad. Praying for everyone affected.  /v I would hope they all become global warming enthusiasts who advocate scientific prevention of natural disasters. however I doubt it.. /v I hope you all aren't serious where's the damage it was so hyped try those being your homes. Your neighborhood. Let's see a storm hit your house and destroy it. Just a regular thunderstorm that didn't have any hype. Lightning hits a tree and boom house is destroyed. You can enjoy fixing your house if you didn't die and not have to worry about that pesky hype /v This is really horrifying, a sub from me. I hope to see more informative videos from you. Thanks for posting. /v Cheap trailers made of aluminum and ply wood held parked on bricks. Wtf do these people think will happen when they live in a hurricane state? I'm sorry but they are completely under built. The city should of changed massive codes in the 80s and stopped people from putting these shacks ups. \n\nI hope they realize a house in Florida should mean concrete walls and slab roof all reinforced with rebar and massive shutters on all windows and doors. \nJust like a cabin in Alaska is set up for major winters a house in a hurricane state should be set up for just that. A hurricane. /v They should design different types of housing for areas where floods can happen. I'm sure scientists and engineers can think of something better than what private construction companies are doing.\nJust like in a heavy tornado region it would likely make sense to live in domes rather than cubes.\nIt's either this or just stop living in hazardous regions. /v And all I'm seeing in twitter was people making fun of irma like nothing happen wtf /v this is ur paradise america /v FAKE NEWS ALERT! I live down here and the damage is minimal this was a cat 2 storm cat 1 up here in Sarasota, these pictures are of a mobile home park that was built below flood surge level... this is common in Florida. Most of these parks are grandfathered in for zoning so you live there at your own risk but no one can get flood or wind insurance. Most of the residential areas that are built to Zone 13' are fine in any storm, that includes everything built in the last 20 or so years. Florida is beautiful and clean today because mother nature knows best... and please  play some Jimmy Buffett when showing these /v I'm confused on why they are only showing mobile home parks....this is Naples, full of million dollar homes. SMH.I used to live there, my mother was there during the storm, show some real Naples.. /v Are those supposed to be houses or chicken coops? /v This film shows manufactured housing communities, which are few and far between in Naples, Florida. /v No double wide trailer is safe! /v Amazing video\nHere is some related post https://goo.gl/tdW1R8 /v It's just water. /v Reminds me of the first settlement in Fallout 4 /v Fellas, was it gay to move away from Irmas path? I mean you are basically running away from a woman.  /v Woterfront properties are expensive. They will come and rebuild in hurry as flood insurances are covered. /v Homes for sale.....fixer upper of course......insurance coverage may be high... /v If I was in a mobile home, or tiny house I wouldn't pick Florida as a place to live. /v Fake news smh....naples we pray for you /v It's so insane tat people are trying to minimize this. People lost their lives and lost their homes. People are dead. People are homeless. This is huge. Stop becoming desensitized to tragedy. Contribute to the aid, contribute whatever you can to help Floridians and also the non-Americans who are in much worse situations than this. They need our help stop minimizing this. /v at least all the Nike Air Jordans made it out safe... /v They can now switch their name from Naples to Venice /v I'm going on vacation to Naples in November oof /v Why are they only showing small unstable homes? Just another case of the media taking things out of proportion /v Harvey was the most extreme rain event in US History. \n\nSource: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/08/29/harvey-marks-the-most-extreme-rain-event-in-u-s-history/?utm_term=.fe57d4b46709\n\nFloods have tripled since the 1980s. \n\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jul/14/8-charts-climate-change-world-more-dangerous\n\nThe US has never had two cat 4 hurricanes hit in a single season in it's history, until now.

May be most houses are good. /v I live in miami. And thank god it wasnt that bad, yes a lot of destruction but it was going to be worse /v Looks like Naples turned into venice /v Ya gotta love them drones. I don't care what anyone says, I want one! /v Looks like property value is going to go down. This place sucks when it comes to real estate investment. Who would ever live in this forsaken place. The fed should just move these people to another area or state. Not worth living in these parts anymore. /v The best thing about Hurricane Irma is that it destroyed Milo Yiannopoulos' house.....unless George Zimmerman got crushed by a tree and I haven't heard about it yet..... /v those homes were a mess to begin with. no offense to any of you trailer trash /v not surprising. wind in a trailer park = this. yawn /v Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23 /v Hope you had flood insurance. /v Mobile homes aren't a good idea in FL. /v not as bad as harvey /v My grandma lives in Naples. She wasn't able to fly to NY where most of our family lives so she had to shack up inside an arena with hundreds if not thousands of other people /v That's where my cousin and aunt lives :/ this is really sad /v and this my friends is what they do to the less fortunate. i bet they will build luxury condos there /v Florida looks like a giant trailer trash community. /v This is actually quite the improvement lol /v The houses are basically like trailers, aluminum roofs etc, this level a damage is to be expected. The storm was way over hyped in regards to Florida. /v W h why would anyone dislike this???? /v Mother earth cleaning up the tailor parks. /v All I see is cardboard houses... /v Reminds me of how the cataclysm affected Azeroth. Even though that's just a video game and this is real, it's scary to see that this much damage can happen! /v Ahahahahaha what a beautiful thing thanks Mother Nature for doing this now tell North Korea to hurry up and nuke them already /v Why only poor people are affected and not trump supporters.. /v Yeah, my naples are wet too... What? /v I guess you can say, it's not Naples anymore but Venice....\n                                   ...am I right ...am I right.? Hello? Anyone? /v better off staying in your car then a trailer /v And thats how we found out that we were atlantis the whole time\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we dont want to be fish people thats is why they are trying to fix this /v Such a beautiful vacation spot!\nLook at all those neighborhood pools! /v At least they have waterfront property now  /v I live in Naples and I was blessed to only have our pool cage get ruined. The inside of our house is fine we just have no power or running water yet; tons of trees have been uprooted and are laying in the streets also. /v Fake News. This is obviously a fake set in Hollywood... /v Trump did say he's going to create more jobs BUT.. he did not say how.\nWhat a waste...\nHouses near the coast need to be built out of CONCRETE and bullet PROOF GLASS(withstand debris), not wood nor (thin)glass. /v This place was so beautiful. I've made a drone video of it and its one of my favorite videos. Hopefully the will put that place to the same condition very soon /v INSUREIT.BONUS.VACATION see ya suckas /v Depopulated,  Gratulation it works /v God Made America Great Again /v I knew Trump would bring more jobs to the US... Still proud of my vote! /v To think most of these people moved to Naples from up north to escape the snowy winters... /v Stolen drone footage. /v fake news /v Hurricane Irma NEW FOOTAGE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7kcYawuMZ0 /v Seems cool. I wanna visit /v my uncle loves there /v :( /v I feel bad for nipples /v Ffs /v :( /v a /v Wow, real, unsensationalized, news. /v https://youtu.be/wLe_DikqJn8\nMUST  /v God punishing trump voters /v Bihhhh we swimming /v NICE. /v  /v raw danger flashbacks /v wow /v Very sad situation /v https://www.gofundme.com/support-caribbean-hurricane-irma /v QQQQno /v So sad....wow /v *tears of joy* /v  Babilonische Talmud Juden  , und mit terror Israel ... alle Massen Mrder und Kriegs Verbrecher ...

(Not all jews just the 1%) /v I'm very saddend to see this but can someone explain to me why americans build thier home with wood structures? Isnt that the worst  matriel to have in a storm/earthquake/flood situation? In my country 95% off the buildings are metal and concrete built. /v Hi everyone, please click here to support my GoFundMe campaign, Daughter needs to meet sick grandma: https://www.gofundme.com/daughter-needs-to-meet-sick-grandma?pc=sms_co_cardshare_a&rcid=1e3d444e7f224257bf92bef3bcef0d9c /v To all of those who feel better sending prayers. I guess they think as people pray..the water evaporates right away and everything goes back to normal... well, not! prayers don't help.. didn't help before it started..they don't help now. Instead of praying if you want..donate either money.. blood..or whatever, but at least do something useful and don't turn your head right the other way after you prayed as if you had done the deed of the day. /v No showers for 2 days. No power. No electricity. No water. \nI feel so sticky. /v Yeah that's bad and all but I feel like they over hyped this hurricane. Kind of like hurricane Matthew. /v As soon as that eclipse happened, bad omen. /v deserved it /v That's how baby hurricanes are made. /v Its because takumi drifts so theres fujiwara effect (fujihwara) /v what happens if I collide 2 sugar coated donuts? does it make a giant donut\n\n\n\njust a joke  /v ok Irma got thicc /v There's so many fake sex bots.. /v 1:04 WAIT A MINUTE DOES that really happen in our country (phillippines???) im curiuos because were so glad that didnt hit us this is my proof that im a filipino FILIPINO LANGUAGE: oh naniniwala na bakayo na pilipino ako nag sasalita ako ng tagalog sana hindi na mangyari yan sa malapit sa bansa namin /v Oh I get it.

Jk /v I wonder where you found this video from...\n\n\n\n\nNOTHING HERE IS ORIGINAL. /v Well Americans call it .......... The Perfect Storm /v I hope we can see a deadliest natural disaster very soon, like 2004 tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands or a volcanic eruption that kills an entire city. Lot of youtube videos to watch yay!  /v is it possible for 2 cat 5s to combine together? /v 1 is not enough !!!\n2 will do :) /v This just makes me think of climate change creating longer lasting mega storms that could travel over continents refueling and continuing for months or years. Time to build a bunker I guess. /v What if a hurricane got nuked?Say a 10 megaton monster got dropped right at the centre. /v So what's the new name for this hurricane? /v What if a cyclone is spinning in one direction and another one is spinning in the reverse direction and they have the same strenght? /v I'm about to eat the fuck out of the hurricanes  /v This video was copied from this video. Some of the wording is exactly the same https://youtu.be/wvaYN7ElTl0 /v Moral of the story: If two storms collide, you are fucked. /v Wish Irma and one more will kill Donald Trump !!!! /v So what you're saying is, forces effect each other.... Amazing..... /v Sooo basically it's really really no bueno if that happens. /v 1:03\nOh hi Philippines\n(Note: we have two hurricanes/typhoons in the Philippines right now soooo) /v Everyone knows that when I need climate and meteorological info, I go to a tech channel... /v Well we had here in the Philippines before, year \n2009 /v NATO, haarp, climate change, etc. /v I just saw my country /v Robot voice: When worlds collide \n\nCaveman: You can run, but no can hide....\n\nRobot: When worlds collide you'll laugh so hard you'll swear you died when worlds collide\nhold my hand I'll be your guide\nwhen worlds collide\nbuckle-buckle-buckle up for the sweetest ride and prepare to have your mind blown wide\nwhen worlds collide\n\nCaveman : When worlds collide it's a curious thing\nbet you've never heard a robot and a caveman sing.\nin his chest are some working parts, but how is that different than a beating heart?\n\nRobot: Im from the future\nCaveman: And I'm from the past,\nRobot: but that doesn't mean that this friendship wasn't built to last\nCavman: He was made in a lab, and I was born in a cave.\nso let me hear you holler in this Inter-era rave\n\nRobot: when worlds colide. /v 0:18 if u looked at the background,it is classified as a typhoon not hurricane/s /v I like watching the swirly clouds on the top, so beautiful, yet so destructive /v ...the year in the Irwin and the other hurricane is wrong. Nevertheless, this was quite interesting. /v Basically it's the same as galaxies. If they are small, they start orbiting the big one. If they are the same size, they collide. /v It gets bigger. End of discussion /v If there is a hurricane in the US, Tech Insider posts videos just about hurricanes.\nWhen there's an election in the US, Tech Insider posts videos about politics.\nWhen there's an earthquake in the US, Tech Insider posts videos about earthquakes.\nWhen TI sees a video they can make profit on, they upload it.\n\nThis is my observation of this channel, there is almost no tech present in here, and for that reason I'm out. /v Reminds me of that movie, 'A Perfect Storm.' /v A ballroom dance really does *stun* you. /v Surprised by comment section expect to see more Hilary jokes  but their almost none so this is  a good section /v 4 hurricanes in the Carribeans in the space of one month. RIP Jamaica. RIP Cuba. RIP everyone in the Carribeans. /v Warmer Climate the cause u say, eh? Trump say, Nay, its China! /v It's the perfect storm... /v This is a repost /v Can you imagine if Harvey and Irma would have collided? It would be the biggest hurricane ever!!  /v Why can't we figure out some awesome plan to stop global warming, global warming is bad and no one cares about it /v so this is how the giant storm in jupiter is still alive /v And 9 months later you have a little category 1 /v This is also a case of the planets gravitational pull /v so its basically like a black hole collision /v Philippines have hurricanes right now! /v What is the white stuff in Hurricane diagrams? /v They had to make up some crap at the end and then blame global warming /v There were two cyclones that collided with each other over one litter town in Australia, and boy, that town almost got obliterated! /v So basically, if two Hurricanes collide, pack your bags and move to Saturn\n\nOh wait, there's a Hurricane that's much, much larger than Hurricane Irma on Saturn. Then I guess, move to Mars?\n\nThat is, if you can survive the gravity of thousands of Earths. Move to Uranus if you can't\n\nThen again, it's a Gas planet, so you won't be able to even touch it. Then, I guess, move to the opposite side of the Planet away from that?\n\nBut what if a Tsunami happens?\n\nIn short, moving to another planet means You're fucked, and moving on the other side of the Planet, still means You're fucked, so I guess of this ever happens, that simply means YOU. ARE. FUCKED! /v The background music made it look like a scary weather dance. /v Hey! Maybe Earth will get a Great Red Spot like Jupiter! A hurricane that circles the planet for centuries! Just imagine the excitement! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh! /v Are all the downvotes from the meteorological experts in the comments?! Uhm they made a mistake I'm a climate expert in the comments! /v The movie 2012... But for real... Nice. /v Be badass if in the future can we create mega af hurricanes and send them to intercept the natural ones heading towards us whoever invents that hmu /v Love the music /v LIKE BLACK HOLES COLLIDING /v FUJIWHARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /v So we're fucked /v What if two tornados collide? /v They DANCE /v Philippines - Meh. /v Wow looks like space storms. /v Some weird ass music /v fidget spinner /v ok /v Boiiii some hurricane saves Philippines life\nTanks fam. /v Fuck Tech Insider. /v Hurricane Hilary? /v KENSEI DORIFTO?!?!?!! /v Its called agar.io  /v Fujiwhara that reminds me of something...Hmm....\n\n\n*TAKUMI FUJIWARA* /v Like galaxies when they collide /v Just like Agar.io /v Soo, what if two category 5 storms collided? /v Hurricane.io /v Hurricane Irma and Jose /v Hurricane Haiyan + Hurricane Irma = Had sex = Heaven /v Thats not a hurricane thats a typhoon /v Speak! /v https://youtu.be/chKYdkMJDAc /v Geostorm!!!!!! /v Nani?!

Whats the ugly stepping in the upper part of the screen?? Who the hell approved the design..Total disappointment. Look at S8 infinite display it brought nice look to the phone. I will stick with My Iphone 7 which is the best design ever... /v EVERYONE SAYING THIS LOOKS THE SAME AS THE IPHONE 7, YOU DONT REALIZE THAT APPLE MOSTLY UPGRADED THE SPECKS. ITS 25% LOUDER, 2 HOURS MORE BATTER LIFE, AR, NEW PORTRAIT MODES, 70% FASTER, ALL GLASS, WIRELESS CHARGING, TRUE TONE DISPLAY, MORE WATER RESISTANT, LIGHTER TO HOLD, AND MORE! \n\nhave a nice day!  /v Will iPhone 7/7 Plus cases be able to fit on this device? /v Drop it without insurance and your done with all that damn glass unless you got the money to just up and buy another one, I was dreading them going back to glass, it's basically white with rose gold features /v Why isn't there a rose goldfor the iPhone 8 /v I JUST WANNA KNOW IF IT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT ALL THIS OTHER SHIT /v smh, still has giant ass bezels. OnePlus 5 still far superior /v i Don't get why its still the same ass design?

I wouldnt hesitate getting an iPhone 8 if it had the dual cameras like the plus. The plus is just too gigantic for my liking. The dual cameras is the only thing worth it to me over all the other new features.

Ok /v dang, her speaking voice reminds me of Alicia keyssss so smooth and gorgeous /v gay guy or dates just non black chicks... sorry /v she needs a strong black woman and he needs a white gay community leader who wants to build a family. /v I think I just realized my sexuality..thank you  I like the mind to /v Pansexual is just a fancy way of saying you're bi, lol what is with these tumblr made up sexuals /v He's a living breathing human zombie!!! he is attracted to your BRAIN!!! /v You are not Native American LMAO . You're black be proud of that. That's like when white people say they're Native American when they look straight from Britain lmao /v Omg this was so misleading. I was %100 sure they were going to make a match, I mean look at them sing in the beginning. /v love them. their harmonies sound great /v his voice is beautiful /v they are so cute /v No love connection but still loved this episode!!! /v They have been my favorite duo so far. Loved them both. /v They both look so good i can't /v THEY CUTEEEEEE i love this friendship /v Awe that didn't turn the way I thought it would /v I thougt they would be together /v when he said Pansexual is a term that specifically denoted the fact that you're attracted to... i automatically filled in the next word with PANS PANS PANS i am terrible /v what is the name of the song that they sing together? /v Wth I was thinking that oml they could be a power couple, they really get each other and they're all about the soul etc etc...\nThen they both said nah.. like whaaaat. But I also get why /v The best romantic relationships begin with strong friendship. If you don't know that - you'll close a lot of the wrong doors.\n\nAlso, he needs help choosing a suit. /v my man dressed up like the president for a blind date /v im kind of in love with both of them,,,,, /v She looks so much like keke palmer it freaks me out /v Wait wait what?!

As I assumed this is what I did. Unfortunately I do not have a  book press. I am concerned about the dry mold and please could you tell me  how to get rid of it. Thank you. /v Bravo! /v Oh my /v but it will still dirty \nhow to clean it !!! /v my book is damaged its pages are sticked to each other so badly that while opening its damaging so plzzzzzz help me /v This was super helpful! Great video! /v Our hearts goes out to the people in Florida currently facing the wrath of this unforgiving storm, May you all stay safe and protected. /v Where is the hurricane yolanda? /v i thought this video was comparing hurricanes. so why did they put typoons in it too /v Saturn's Storm, huh? Its probably a catagory OVER 9000!!!!!! /v If saturns storm struck earth my house would be located on mars /v Saturn's storm would wipe out all of North America, northern South America, Europe, and Western Africa /v hurricane ike was 900 miles in diameter /v Ok let's just all take a moment to realize HOW FUCKING BIG THSE ARE /v Jupiters big red spot is twice as big as the earth /v Do a fruit size comparison /v if saturn has the largest hurricane, then what the heck is the great red spot?? /v HOW THE FUCK DID I SURVIED THE 3RD BIGGEST STORM  WTF  IS MY FAMLIY SECRETLY RICH MY MUM  WAS PREG WITH MY LITTLE 4 YR OLD SIS O.O /v Typhoon tip Should be called hurricane ALEJANDRA boi my sister is like the devils sister /v What about Jupiter's? 0/10 /v From the list, I was in Katrina as a tropical depression, Irma as a Cat 2 hurricane (got electricity back yesterday), and Hurricane Matthew as a Cat 3 hurricane (he went up the Atlantic coast and I'm on the Gulf coast and was moderately windy with light rain here). I was also in Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Hermine in 2016. And I've rode out too many tropical storms to name. Gotta love tropical weather :) /v This video is WRONG!\nHurricane Irma is category 2! /v Hurricane Ike was the size of the whole Gulf of Mexico. I'm from Galveston and we got ripped apart. This storm should be included. /v I like how the video just starts talking and showing what you came for. No fake giveaway, No 7 minutes of talking, It's good! You earn a like. /v The last one i was like  /v do you know? Saturn's storm have Category 10 and 1000 mph winds, this is the deadly hurricane /v I have been through sandy..\nI just wanted to go outside that time /v Harvey,shut down lots of oil places /v Oh I never knew that saturns story was a hurricane /v Its weird to see Saturns Storm is bigger than all of the hurricanes combined /v Holy crap, those are some huge hurricanes /v lmao rip florida you will be remembered /v I'm lucky to be in England because we don't get hurricanes and tornados and natural disasters like that /v Some of the cyclones are spinning the wrong way. /v The biggest hurricane in the solar system is Jupiter's big red spot which is capable of fitting two earths inside /v go figure the largest hurricane on record is from 1979. Almost 40 years ago. And I'm sure there were plenty much bigger before Modern Equipment to Measure them. SUCK IT Global Warming LIARS.  It's all a HOAX. /v I wish we had storm's more like Saturn's /v I give this to whoever named hurricane Tip: **sarcastic clap** /v Look kids!  Hurricanes keep getting bigger and bigger over time due to GLOBAL WARMING! Oh wait 1979.....CLIMATE CHANGE!  Can't you people see! /v you should have placed the Strongest storm to ever hit land /v Praying for those who are affected by hurricanes. Praying brings in a lot of positivism in life. Science supports the power of positive affirmations. When you release positive thoughts to the universe, the universe will return back it to you as things, later in the life. Concept well explained in the book Creative Visualization written by Shakthi Gawain. Here are some positive affirmations. https://youtu.be/ujOyoxLyqSg. /v When Saturn's storm was appearing, I thought that it was a joke hurricane  /v Your animation is wrong. they spin in the wrong direction... /v Did the music have to be this freaky? /v Why have I watched this a million times /v Where the fuck is Haiyan, and the Great Red Spot of Jupiter? /v Kinda of a bad comparison.. hurricane whoever fuck jus twent right up Florida's ass. U aint see it destroyed /v Why is a typhoon included in a hurricane video? Weird. /v Who the fuck named the smallest hurricane Marco? Well fuck you retard. /v Now everyone's saying hearts out to Florida but what about the islands it hit before that cant handle that sort of damage eh /v Largest hurricane found in Jupiter which dumbass don't know their own solar system /v cyclone should turn other way... /v Typhoons, Hurricanes and cyclones are different. /v i thought the storm raging on Jupiter was biggest cuz it can swallow all of Earth /v shat my pants at the end /v I live in Cleveland Ohio nowhere near any ocean, only the great lakes and I remember us not having power and school for like 3 days........ /v Saturn's storm? Is that actually real Bc if it is why isn't there a date.... /v it's Jupiter NOT Saturn /v *you spin me right round baby...* /v It's distracting that you are making your hurricanes rotate in the wrong direction. /v did you got a wrong direction of rotation of those hurricanes?? /v What if there was a hurricane that was the size of the Atlantic Ocean /v The biggets hurricane that We know of is the red spot on Jupiter /v What is the song /v You do realize that it's Jupiter that has the hurricane, right? That's what the big red spot is. /v What about the Red Spot on Jupiter? /v PLEASE WATCH AND SHARE :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeOqRSqv9jk /v My friend be like\nFriend:dude what if you give names to the hurricanes.\nMe:umm maybe i can not do that i mean how crazy it is.\nFriend:give me an example.\nMe:ummm Hurricane Karen?\nFriend:mine is Hurricane Christy\nMe:wow! You are a great name caller.\nFriend:yeah! You too i mean we have the best names!\nMe:yeah! I agree. /v Think you meant Jupiter's red spot super cyclone and not Saturn. /v your all hurricanes are spinning in just OPPOSITE DIRECTION!! /v Isn't the Great Red Spot the biggest Storm in the solarsystem? /v You should do Tornado Size Comparisons or Volcano Size Comparison /v Tropical cyclone rotates counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere /v Where is Yolanda from Philippines /v And Also,Saturns Hexagonal Storm Is An Anti-Hurricane which it spins Uhhhhh..... Counter Clockwise? Clockwise? Pls Like My Comments and reply to me if I'm wrong /v I'm surprised that Super Typhoon Haiyan wasn't mentioned. It was big, VERY powerful at landfall, and caused A LOT of death and destruction! It was one of the perfect storms! /v man what if Saturn's storm hit us this world would be toast lol /v A tropical depression, to his dad: Where do baby storms come from? \nHis dad: Well, the himicane meets a hurricane, and he sticks his tornado inside the hurricane's eye, and shoots hail out of it. The hail enters the hurricane's eye, and a tropical wave emerges out of the eye a few hours later. /v Demonetized. /v Laters /v Figet spinners started irrma/harvey.. /v Wheres the HAIYAN SUPERTYPHOON /v last one category 100 /v Cyclone Gavin??? /v Oh hell! /v Hurricane Nigger /v Jupiter's Red Spot? /v Where is Sandy? /v Fuck global warming /v wheres iniki hirricane /v Make a tornado Comparison /v Andddd n oone cares /v Hurricanes are not clockwise cyclones are /v Saturn storm category 110 /v typhoon tip: I'm huge asf boooiii\nSaturn's storm: sike /v Do eruption comparison /v hurricane Otto /v Wow a real eye opener /v Hurricane saturn: hold my Beer bitches -_- /v My names Olivia...... /v wheres hurricane ike? /v Ill forget about Irma xD /v Check out Cyclone Yasi /v WOW! /v wrong rotation direction /v You forgot Harvey /v The best rock and roll singer and one of the greatest bands of all time.  Bryan May is one of my favorite guitarist. /v Long live Freddie mercury. The best  /v Freddie Mercury you will be  in our hearts!!! /v Wonderful queen. Stricking performance!!. Love you Freddie /v Beautiful video thanks for sharing!! /v wow,  brilliant quality thank you /v Mercury Forever!!!!!!!!!! /v Priceless. Timeless. Bloody brilliant. Where did the music go? :/ /v This is the last of the three trial Basics videos! This pushed my quick-explanation skills to the limit, but I figure that slow down the video and replay if necessary is better than let people get bored... /v Great and very interesting as always! /v wouldn't the theoretically best method be to use a tree that used, not just letters, but sequences longer than individual digits? such as 2-digits, or even whole words (Each of which would be followed by a space, essentially removing the need for the space to be in the huffman tree). such as the 200 most frequently used words in a novel + individual letters in order to assemble those that don't fall under the top 200? i'm betting this is, indeed, how more advanced implementations of huffman's coding works. /v Why not do this series together with computerphile? /v You should check out Joanthan Panicker's (actual spelling) channel, he's got a pretty savage bird and he found 60000000000000000000000000 dollars. /v An easy trick is to build the tree dynamically. Forinstance,  for 'wicky wild wild', make a tree of all letters with frequency set to 0, encode 'w', rebuild tree for 'w' with frequency 1, encode 'i', rebuild tree for 'i' with frequency 1, and so on. Encoder and decoder read the letters in the same order, produce the same tree. /v Wow the writing... SO GOOD !! /v Why does this amazing explanation has to be released after my semester exams??  /v You missed range and arithmetic encoding :-) /v Nice job with this... /v Tom! This video leaves me wanting for so much more!! /v now do GZIP/7z/RAR... jpg/png/bmp... mp3/wav/ogg... i gots to know /v what ya gonna do when you hit 1mill subs?\nPS really love the series /v Can't wait for the video on zip files :) /v Or as it's known today; Huffcod. /v I feel like an expert /v I hate it when I send the wrong worms /v I love this series. If you decide to continue, I would be very much for it! /v These series are great, Tom. You have a knack for explaining complicated concepts intuitively without losing what's important. Do you use any unconventional techniques for understanding the concepts deeply enough to capture the gist of them like this? My current strategy is reading and trying to incorporate the concept in my current knowledge base, but it usually takes 2-3 readings to do. /v I know about this stuff already but still watch it because Tom Scott is a good lad /v This is magic. I've just finished my text compression algorithm in C++ the day before yesterday, and this video was uploaded. I feel I'm being observed. /v cool story bro, gotta split mid video to go watch the will smith music video /v Ha! a love the send the wrong worms :-) /v Awesome presentation....inspired by you...I am an IT engineer...:wanna start my tech channel too after viewing your video and fan base....wish me good luck  /v Belatedly: That was really clear and comprehensible! It didn't feel too quick at all to me - it was all straightforward and easy (for me) to understand. Good job! /v One shot, no jumpcut, that's amazing. /v 0:54\n\ndid he just say the wrong worms instead of the wrong words? /v A note about image/video compression at 0:45 : there are a lot of lossless compression methods, especially for images. You don't typically deal with uncompressed lossless files (e.g. bmp, the netpbm formats, raw images), but rather png (more or less row by row zip compression), gif (lossless if you fit the 256 color palette) or other lossless images. /v This guy's content is just as good if not better than Thoughty2 so how come that bloke has more than twice the subscribers? /v Whoever did your makeup did a terrible job. /v 0:53 idk whether its intentional or not, or maybe i heard him wrong, Tom said the worng worms instead of the worng words i thiing its intentional, and it makes me like Tom even more. keep up the great vids! /v the Huffman coding was one of the questions in algorithm test last semester and everybody got a different answer at the end. it seems easy but the calculations are a bit confusing especially if you're not allowed to use calculators. /v I had to write this algorithm for one of my CS classes...using ADA. /v That was very interesting...the more you know eh? /v 0:54 I see what you did there :D /v texting. destroyer of youth a pox on humanity. /v what if (or when) AI came up with more efficient ways of compressions? /v the animating in this was so smooth! /v Why can't I give you 5 likes for this video :-( /v THANK YOU TOM SCOTT!! I have wondered how compression like this worked for the better part of a decade, and I've even put a decent amount of time into researching it, but it never clicked until this video.  You have the best content on this entire platform, both in subject matter and quality. /v Can you please do videos based on computer science 2210 whole theory syllabus? I really need help with my exams which are on October. I hope you see this message. Please like this so he can see. I never comment on YouTube videos. And I really want to get good results on this exam. My computer teacher sucks. I'm desperate. /v The only thing better than being the best is mathematically proving you are the best. /v What is the work joke? I don't get it /v ... send the wrong worms. Ha! I see what you did there! /v And I can apply Huffman to save the Huffman tree, and the Huffman code, or again. So actually  we are just trading space for work, right? Or storing information into work? That's cool. Maybe it's what the universe is doing right now, unveiling its stored  Huffman code through chemical reactions. /v Yeah, cool stuff. I'll just keep using my golang gzip/(whatever your preference is) library since I'm trusting scientists to do this for me. Seriously, I'm too busy actually building things irl to re-invent the wheel just for fun. /v I wrote a full on huffman compressor for fun once. I was disappointed that it only yielded about, like you see here, 30% compression (leaving 70% the original size.) I figured I did something wrong. /v I read the thumbnail as How Computers Computers Text /v As usual, darned fascinating! Please continue with the series. I know _some_ stuff but I'm learning lots! /v Always wanted to say that I love your voice, Tom. This is actually the reason why I subbed. /v Can we please get into foreign characters? /v You should keep doing this kind of videos, it was enjoyable and really informative - don't get me wrong I always learn something from your vids, but this was one of a kind- /v I love this channel so much /v Tom, thank you for reminding mr how good Youtube can be. /v Cnt u leve out ltrs nd jst hve a way to ad thm in at th end? So long as ech wrd is uniq or has cntxt clus? /v Wow I can hear the buzz from the old monitors that's funny /v This guy is vsauce IT edition /v Now i understand why windows have 64 bits and 32 bits.. \nwow thanks sir!! :D\nEdit: by that i mean\n64^64 or 32^32 bits \nRight? :) /v where did you get two working BBC model B computers? - haven't see one for a couple of decades /v I love you and your vimeos. /v xz -9ev some_huge_file.txt  (now let's wait a few days) /v 0:50 Otherwise you wind up sending the wrong worms\nI see whatcha did thar... /v Next vid will be intermediate and cover zip files.\n\nThe way you explain things makes everything easy to understand! /v So you're telling me Will Smith *wasn't* rapping about the Wild Wild West wiki I'm sure exists about that movie? /v This one of only two things I remember from my programming module - the other is a habit of typing both the open and close brackets at the same time. /v i think i understood that... /v I like the series /v If you break in to house and steal cold cuts out of fridge are you then a hamburglar /v This was so interesting and good. Wanted it to keep going! /v The lossy compression bit was brilliant. Making it look compressed at the right time. /v I, too, hate it when I end up sending the wrong worms. /v No need to make Unicode seem more complex than it is. The ascii characters have the same code points in Unicode. Unicode just gives you more including characters for other languages. Could just say they are stored as extended sequences which in UTF-8, they are. /v I've always wondered how this works, this is amazing! /v this feels like something quantum computers could speed up, i dont know though it just seems like it /v That's a numberwang!.. Oh wait, nice explanation. /v 0:50 ...sending the wrong *worms*  I see what you did there =D /v @0:52 haha send the wrong worms? nice one! /v Really amazing video quality. Something very different this time. I love your channel... /v ...the wrong worm.

We spoke a while back about doing some videos like this for GCSE Computer Science students, this is perfect. Hope the trial goes well and you fancy doing some more :-) /v haHA!!! Worms. I don't get it? /v Love it when a youtube video makes me feell like I lerned something. Tbank you, Tom /v sending the wrong WORMS  haha , I see what you dis there ! /v great video!  I have been wondering this for quite a while (but been too lasy to look it up ...) /v I thought it was: take the most common words, assign a brand new character to each of them, and insert whenever that character comes up. /v Hoffman ripped off Euclid but a search tree is a elemtry algorithm /v the wrong worms  /v Wah Huffman Coding is so clever... /v sending the wrong worm haha /v How big Weissman score can the algorithm achieve? /v 7 mill views 6 comments /v At the end of the vid  /v Last 10 min are priceless /v @abcactionnews hi I was wondering last night Denis Philip was talking about rumors that Irma went to category 6 and other ppl said that impossible but he said that because of the mph Irma was technically went category 7. So I would like that piece of the live to save it can you please let me know if you put it on? If I have to pay tell me I buy it. /v To the person reading this, you are who God says you are.

Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said: 'Sell him to me,' and he bought him for two black slaves. Then he did not accept the pledge from anyone until he asked: 'Is he a slave?'\nGrade : Sahih (Darussalam) \nReference : Sunan an-Nasa'i 4184\nIn-book reference : Book 39, Hadith 36\nEnglish translation : Vol. 5, Book 39, Hadith 4189 /v Tell me something now /v I'm far away so I'm lucky /v Say N I G G E R! /v So many racist crack heads!!!!

I'm shocked!...smh /v 1. Kill or be killed\n2. Memorise that law well. /v did they eat the sacrificed animals? /v The Gerousia essentially ran Sparta. They decided what laws were passed, if the Kings had broken any laws,  and what laws were even considered to be voted upon. These Gerousia being divided up between the Royal Houses just goes to prove that Sparta was not even remotely close to a Democracy, or at least a good one, even despite voting. /v So in a nutshell sparta was an oligarchy /v Where did you get all of this information? Xenophon's book?\nI checked for it and it was at least $160 U.S and at most $210 /v Wasn't defeated by Helot Up Rising or a bunch of Angry Greeks? Come on man. By the time of the Romans, the Spartans were nothing because THEY WERE DEFEATED by Helots and Greeks. The lives lost during the Peloponnesian war and during the Thebes War had the spartans crushed, reducing their population. Then the helots rebelled and reduced their land in half. That was literally why the Spartans lost. Sure reform would be nice but they were THE super power in greece for hundreds of years. By the time the Romans came, that was hundreds of years later. Sparta would have been better if they didn't pursue the vacuum of power that Athens left. They should have stuck to their isolationist foreign policy that they always had and slowly expand like they always had. /v Has there always been this many channers on this side of YT? /v Did you really propose immigration as a solution to Spartan problems? No sir. Immigration was the cause of demise to all ancient governments including the Romans.\n\nOne thing you forget to mention about the Spartan society is how obssesed they were with economic disparity. To force sobriety they would accuse one another of undeclared wealth which would force them to pay for the city's infrastructure and reforms. They wasted tons of money trying to hide it so they weren't particularly keen to the rigurous system, but it was their city so while this was true they didn't care. The Spartans had an excelent system but it was too expensive.\n\nTheir problem was like any other greek kingdom. Economics. The  fall of the Delian League left the Spartans with too much land to rule under a centurial system concieved for just the Peloponnese. This created political instability, poor quality foreign governments and eventually famine, with the exception of Macedon, Greece became a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurrounded by a cilmate of dire economic conditions the Spartans unable to support the growing inflation suddenly percieved the life outside of the strict highly expenssive Spartan society was increasingly more appealing, and began to leave the city for a live of carelessness who gets it keeps it free for all, until eventually were but some few thousand men inside Sparta to keep it safe. /v You left out the Theban invasion, which helped many helots break free /v The giant red block at the end is so emblematic of the Romans /v How many Spartans does it take to change a lightbulb?\n800. One to force a Perioeci to change it, and 799 to prevent a Helot uprising. /v You have just earned a sub. Good work. /v love the channel thanks :D /v I thought Athens was more important? /v Massive wealth disparity is still uncool, even when it is in the name of female empowerment. /v A very nice video. It would have been interesting if you went into the Periokoi as well, and the Spartans without citizenship. As a Spartan had to fullfill certain requirements to be a citizen and the inheritance system meant fewer and fewer citizens could exist as more and more land went to a few people. Also I think a distinction should be made between Laconian Helots and Messenian Helots, the former were always more loyal as Sparta was their state. Tough laws against Helots also seem to have only appeared after several Messenian Helot revolts and were probably not part of the original constitution. /v Men with balls of steel. /v I had no idea that Sparta's political system was so unusual. Thanks for a great video. /v Love the conclusion , super interesting video , hope to see more like these . /v I always knew Aristotle was lame. /v Please, do the Athenian Democracy next. They had many Elements in common with the Spartan system but without kings or the council of elders. /v This is a hell of a way to celebrate 9/11 /v Really interesting. Going to use this for my D&D campaign for sure. /v Well this video blown up /v Wow, usually your videos are really great, but this one completely blew me away. I didn't know much about the spartans, just that they were very conservative. Wow. Keep up the excellent work! /v This was very very interesting /v Seems like a whole lot of work put in place so that nothing gets done, being a Spartan must have been frustrating! /v I like the little pauses. Really allows a moment to reflect on the different possibilities. /v The Spartans recruited from the Helots at least once if my memory serves me right. I suppose they could not get enough children to keep the population at acceptable levels. /v For a much better analysis of Sparta, read Friedrich Schiller's essay Lycurgus and Solon and the comparison of their ways of the Athenian and Spartan government and culture. A major mistake in the early part of the video is about children which upon birth became property of the state. /v Does the term Xeno come fround Xenophon being an outsider in Sparta? /v Too stable???????\nBitch, Sparta existed as a stable Polis untill the Roman Conquest. That means like 500 years. Name any other city with this record.\n\nUnkown reasons????????????\nNo man, the reasons are known. The Thebans anihilated the spartan male army and decimated the female army with their recently invented sarissa strategy. This is why, one generation later, Philip and Alexander could easily subdue the spartans. It's simply a matter of population decline.\nReformations? As in Athens? The city that fell and rose every fifty years? You crazy man?\n\nSorry, but the ending deserves a thumbs down. Can't believe you try to pass political propaganda as History, nevertheless the ignorance of the Theban-Spartan War. /v *Rome came in* The fuck is this?.... eh whatever, mine now /v I read the title and I dropped everything I was doing to fully enjoy this.\n\nI don''t care how barbaric it turns out to be the idea of a spartan constitution, idk it just sounds fucking epic. /v I absolutely love your videos. It's just a shame you haven't noticed governments are not here to solve problmems, but they're the very cause of them. Take your time to read some authors like Mises, Hayek and Rothbard. You'll notice that it isn't a matter of willingness to make people's life better, but rather a matter of logic. \nGreetings from Brazil! /v Very informative!!! Ive read about Spartan law and ive came away with more watching this.. hopefully next youll do some about spartan kings and there stories /v Am i the only one thats seeing black spots inbetween the square people 15:15 /v Friggin' A, I love these videos /v This system of government is so insanely bad and vulnerable to abuse that it is a miracle that this state lasted so long.... /v We Spartans are the strongest!!!\n\nAnd then the Roman Legions arrived. xD /v not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame. /v All of these optical illusions with the bunched up squares /v You make such great videos! /v to me [degeneracy] sounds like they were just having a good time\nAnd that is why the West is dying. History tells some hard truths that we refuse to aknowledge because we are too weak willed to  offend someone, or take initiative. /v this is really interesting. before this video i did not have the slightest idea about how the spartan state operated /v I learned a lot. Seriously, 3 minutes from one of your vids is worth like 5 modern BBC documentaries. /v Pls more of these videos and make them longer /v It were the women that brought down the fall of Sparta. /v ALL THE GREEKS JOINED ALEXANDER THE GREAT,ONLY THE SPARTANS STAYED BEHIND FOR FRAPE!!!\n\nHORIS LOGIA!!! /v Wasn't there a class of non-citizen freemen who lived in the Spartan lands? If I remember correctly they mainly did the jobs that were seen as above the Helots but beneath the Spartans proper, such as a good deal of the merchant work, as well as serving in the army if called upon. In fact if my memory of my undergraduate reading doesn't fail me it was actually possible for these freemen to be elevated into full Spartanhood under very special conditions and with the support of a Spartan citizen. /v Please, make  battle of stirling bridge,but without William Wallace throwing fire through the eyes and thunder through the butt.\nI love your history videos. /v It's nice to see how popular this channel is. There is so much junk on You Tube it's nice to see some people still have class. Hail Caesar o.o/ /v 22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure. /v Wow, they sound like they have a pretty Democratic system. /v Waiting forever for another one of his videos, good lord I love them :) /v Sounds like the Gerousia were kinda detrimental to the whole thing. /v I've seen an in-depth historian's account on the Spartan mythos that debunks a lot of their image as the dominant Greek military power.  Long story short, tales of the Battle of Thermopylae became overblown propaganda, even corrupting the perceptions of Sparta pre-Persian invasion.  It wasn't until much later that Sparta got a strong, sophisticated military, perhaps just from trying to live up to their new reputation.  Self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.  Only really relevant to the opening of this vid.  As always, thanks for all this fascinating info! /v this is the greatest history channel on youtube! /v And here comes Rome to fuck all y'all shit up /v Probably their government got big and ate the honest citizenry. /v The artstyle and general visual digestion of this video is quite spartan. /v Is this video about the constitution of Sparta or Spammers? Cause your comments section is unusually infested. /v I believe not every ancient authors were uncritically admiring of Sparta. They suffered a pretty nasty defeat against Thebes at Leuctra, after all, and it was downhill from then on. It's a pretty important battle in ancient military strategy, I hope Historia Civilis covers it some day. /v It didn't help when the Spartans killed their babies to see if they were perfect or not. /v DAYUM! You shit on their entire system of government at the end!! Maybe all the hommies moved out cause they wanted to have a little fun? /v Ah the Gerousia, my fallback for when someone who doesn't understand statistics talks about how life expectancy in ancient times. /v So that's why Sparta fell, feminism. It all makes sense now. /v In Xenophon the X is pronounced like in the word x-ray not like z /v ...My God, and I thought Rome's government was confusing. I've rewatched this many times, and I honestly followed Rome better than this shitfest. Holy hell man... /v Are you going to do the wars with Persia? /v You had no business dismissing Aristotle for criticizing extreme wealth and luxury. He was totally right - and pretty much all the other ancient philosophers have the same criticisms of the elites of their societies. Great video otherwise, but that one point was surprisingly stupid. /v Firstly, in the From Democrats to Kings, Michael Scott narrates a lot of battles throughout the V and IV B.C centuries and also how warfare evolved to something more killing efficient. I don't remember if it was him or someone who was debating on the specific topic of Sparta's declining military prowes, but it was a point that the continous loss of men able to fight and also the inability for the Spartans to change that was responsable for it's eventual decline. I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks? Ha! I will see myself out. /v Their was nothing glorious about Sparta they were a dictatorship fascism slave society, it was doomed to fail. /v When you say that a spartan male reached adulthood he received land from the state im pretty sure that only Spartan citizens received land. And to be a citizen you had to pass the Agoge (spartan military education) not simply come of age /v 1:14 The Spartans didn't really speak the same language. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nxD4GDJXCw /v Wern't the Spartans defeated in a battle with Thebes, before Macedon conquered Greece? /v I wish you mentioned the messenians. /v Wow, you got a trending video! /v I love the Rome videos and don't want them to end, but I'm super-psyched that you're expanding your territory.

Been here since Dolan Dark memed your swimming video. /v I think it would be amazing if the duct taped shoes remained in continuity that way for the entirety of the rest of the videos. /v HowToBasic meets AlanTutorial /v I am VERY ANGRY.

Great videos dude. /v Not sure if you've heard of it, but there's this video site called YouTube, where you can probably look up how to tie your shoes. It'll\nshow you step by step. Get it? Step? Shoes? I'll go home. /v do Cutting Paper\nEating a Burger\nDoing a homework\n\n- (Requesting for a month now) /v This was the best integration of a SquareSpace sponsored video ever!!!!! /v I watch you since your first video on your channel - since you had no more than 10 subs - I hope I can be with your journey for a longer time and see how your channel grows :3 /v I was expecting the shoes to explode or something, but alright he nailed it. /v He caught the run-away plant! /v You are the GOD of crazy /v Didn't actually expect whatishappeningtome.com to be real, it is. /v this channel is Similar to how to basic channel but way better and less Disgusting /v He really dedicates a lot of time/money for these videos. Bought a plant and broke it immediately in his house and had to clean it up. Then he completely ruined 2 pairs of shoes and wasted tape. (I mean wasting tape isn't that serious but still) Definitely a great channel and I'm glad that I found you. Keep up the great work! :) /v He's overrated. Don't deny this- you know it's true. /v This is probably the happiest ending I've seen in one of his videos so far. /v I have a strong hung this guy's April Fools video will be Making Scrambled Eggs and will be a completely normal video of him making eggs. /v 016 everyone did that at one point /v He made ads entertaining...\n\nLet me repeat that\n\n\n\n*HE MADE ADS ENTERTAINING* /v I like The Effort Keep up the Videos man /v I knew it. I absolutely knew tying his shoes would become a subject at one point. Just surprised he didn't injure himself worse yet. /v Wait, hold on. Are those Air Force 1s? I didn't know they still made those. I wore them in the 5th grade. Damn. /v Did you try turning your shoes on and off first? /v You can't tie a shoe but you can tie the string to the needle lol /v Was expecting a dark twist... /v I love how the website at the end looks like something from 15 years ago.

You're doing it all wrong.\n\nYou do a loop-de-loop and pull, then your shoes are lookin' cool! /v I expected him to go for a walk after putting duct tape on his legs, and walk into a building with a no shoes sign! /v We need more creative and original creators like you. Wish you were more well known  /v HA YOU CANT TIE YOUR SHOES THAT MEANS YOU'RE STUPID HA HA /v For those who don't know, the website at the end is real. It's whatishappeningtome.com . /v Idk whats more impressive, the fact he cant tie shoes, or the knots he makes when he messed up /v While still good, I think episodes are getting more lame on the way. If you have to take more time for original ideas, please do. Twice a month is fine as well. Good luck on your endeavors :) /v Wait. He couldn't just slip on the already-tied green shoes? xD /v I legit thought of you making a video on this topic on Thursday XD /v Aww man, I wanted it to escalate higher... Like it thought he would accidentally tie his hands together, or try to use an industrial staple gun with the shoe on his foot and start bleeding and have a cast, and then try to put the shoe over the cast. Or rip the laces and try to use a bunch of rope from the garage to tie the shoe. Or use the duct tape but put it sticky side out and get it stuck to everything in the house, forcing him to make a shoe tying machine that goes bazerk and ties everything in his house into bows... Or something on that level... /v Liked cause I seen Air Forces /v HEY! I never said you could use my failed shoe tying tutorial for a video! /v Killing a spider /v im a retarded piece of shit niggerfaggot /v How everyone feel when they were kids /v A while back I saw this on creators on the rise, I watched one video and couldn't stop.

I love your work, and you do a great job, but just because you have a sponsor doesn't mean you have to compromise your idea... I have told a lot of people about your videos, and hope you get the recognition you deserve, but if this is the route that it is going I feel like I've also let a lot of folks down. Just saying, obviously. /v Your videos are amazing, but too infrequent to become popular.

Depends on the size of ya town. /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUalqi6oVOc raw ass rapper from Chicago that's very slept on. /v I guess the worse thing that could happen out of the top of my head is you tell her you have deep feelibgs for her she tells you that she has deep feelibg for you as well but wants to take it slow and not rush into a relarionship and then she leaves for 2 months to her old city and she wants you to go but you have a new job and no money so one of her guy friends tag along she stops talking to for the whole trip then she comes back and tells you her and the guy are now dating and have been for 3 weels now you try to get some kind of explonation and then she does a total 180 and tells you that you didnt understand her and that she had deep feelings for me only as a friend and then you bring up the time you two almost kissed and she says that never happened and she says that she still wants to be friends I guess that would be the worst that could happen. /v that bar joke was fucking great! xD /v I lost my shit when the hungry little caterpillar popped up as her favorite book /v this is literally me everyday /v Yep...unfortunately, that's about right. /v anyone else ever know a girl, befriended her, joked with her, she gave you nicknames and told you about past experiences, then you fell in love with them, then they forget you the next school year? Happened to me, twice! /v Oh. I thought this was one of those crappy movie reviews. /v Hahahahaha this is so good /v I hope people actually understand the well played sarcasm here and see the meaning lol /v Casually Explained, that last one was oddly specific. You alright there bud? /v Ya know all this could be avoided if you get yourself a waifu /v Boo I make my move anyway win or lost I don't care /v Man the fuck up..simple. Quit being scary..and go after what you want /v keep waiting for the stealing your kidney one... like you said, there is always tomorrow. /v So you copy grade A under A /v Oil your penis and then pull it back and forth until some weird white substance comes out /v The animation video is a great\nHere is some related post https://goo.gl/ANPfkx /v Well that sorts that out, I'm going to die alone... /v You ask your crush out:\nShe's says she fucking hates you\nShe talks bullshit about you to her friends\nShe ignores you\n\nWhat's the worst it could happen?\nI really can't tell on this one.....\nGo seek better opportunities /v I dont know why but this was oddly inspiring /v I have music, check me out https://soundcloud.com/user-172471921/ungodly-ty-locked-in /v lmfaoooo /v Omg your deadass funny /v oof /v Reminds me of the opening scene of idiocracy: www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwZ0ZUy7P3E /v Never clicked on anything quicker in my life /v I suggest renaming the video to Casually Explained: Self Cock block /v CasuallyAnxious /v tomorrow never comes /v WTF!?? Lmao xD I loved this so much!! /v i loves these videos :) /v Discovery Coffee, mm. /v VIRGIIIIINNNSSSSSSS /v Gotta stay away from thots, amirite? /v Nice lol /v The worst that could happen? You end up married with 3 kids only to have the bitch divorce you and force you into paying for her shit for 18 years along with seeing your kids only on weekends while she uses those weekends to get boned by a unemployed shitbird while you are forced to work into your 80s due to your retirement fund being relabeled child support and alimony. Have fun chasing that ass guys. /v Wow this was the best one yet also worst, I feel personally attacked. /v Wait, so you're telling me I'm RIGHT about how I handle attractive woman?

Women are evil. /v I really injoy you're videos man !! keep up the good work ! /v Exactly how I feel in these scenarios. I just say it's probably not worth it and I go about my business as usual. I foresee more loneliness in my future but I also foresee no divorce settlements, which means I at least get to keep all my shit. My shit is important. /v I can't be the only one who actually thinks like this? /v Preach /v  /v Delicious bean water /v Haha this is funny! *cries softly into pillow* /v 10/10 best tutorial ever /v 1. Great looking, sense of humor, snappy dresser, likes to dance.  Worst that could happen: He's gay, and dating your ex-boyfriend, who you turned gay.\n2. Stable job, good income. Seems to like puns, has a mechanical pencil collection, and names his socks (after Dark Horse comic book characters). Owns an Atari 2600 and brags about it to strangers.  Worst that could happen: Engineer. And gay. And better than you.\n3. First time you met, he went in for the quick-hug, as if you were close friends. And then sniffed your hair. Although he doesn't stare at your chest, which is nice, he does stare at your feet. And said your toes are adorable.  Has a scraggly soul patch. Second-worst that could happen: He is confusing you for a girl he saw on Chaturbate. Actual worst that could happen: You are the girl he saw on Chaturbate.\n4.  You keep running into him at improbable places and times. He acts like he doesn't see you, but gets nervous and runs away when you call him out. You are suspicious that he is a stalker. Worst that could happen: it turns out he's not a stalker, and those were just coincidences. Now you're bummed because you feel like maybe you aren't good enough to stalk.\n5. He has a popular YouTube channel. You think it involves cats. Or cooking. Or cooking for cats. Whatever it is, he has a warehouse full of something called merch, which you think may be some sort of narcotic. Possibly for cats. He brags about his subs and says that he is way more interesting than a Pootie-Pie, whatever the f*ck that means. Worst that could happen: you end up being a groupie for team 10. /v Thought all were bad scenarios....\nIf a girl is into you its all the subtle gestures she gives you,most girls are not blunt,you just have to be aware of the little things, a touch,a lingering touch .....a huge smile,everytime you come around,and playfulness.....its not brain surgery....an if she defends you to anyone ......your gold /v Trkiye trendlerine giriyor trk yok aq /v Bu neden trendlerde moruk daha fazla minecraft kanser videolar ve clickbait grmek istiyorum keke yle kaliteli ierikler hi trendde olmasa. /v Tam giyim maazas mzii ehehehehe /v u boulma sahnesi aleyna babannkine benziyo /v Olm bu youtube turkiye trendlerine giriyorsa burda turkler vardir turkler bi +1 /v Bu niye trendde /v ok gzel lan  /v Greetings from Turkey  /v Great song!

It didn't fool me the first time, and since it's nearly impossible to do any variations, you can't fool anyone with it more than once.

Hey, where are you going? ...guys? /v best scene with a best actresses and with the best acting /v the cersei acting was so good, the little moment when she ask: why did you do that? and then shes face change completely to a sentimental face and than she realize that shes losing control and position and recover herself with that revenge face again /v Lena is such a great actress. Everybody focus on their fav charactes but really few realize how much effort this woman puts on making Cersei so perfectly hateful /v So sad these incredible actresses were wasted on a mediocre script. Dave and Dan don't deserve them. /v Now we know why lena's acting was phenomenal in this scene, because it was the first Scene to film for S07 and she was pissed. /v Let the most beautiful woman in the world talk for fuck sake /v I much prefer Indira's regular voice to Ellaria's... /v I was wondering if bad pussy was dead yet everytime we were in kingslanding this season /v What happened to them??? They totally abandoned their story line /v How do you watch full episodes in the UK? /v OH NO! Dorne which was never conquered by the Targaryens and has one of the biggest army will now retaliate. Oh wait,  the tv show writers are too dumb to replicate a complex multilayered story.  The rest of the world doesn't exist anymore,  only a handful of characters and they're plot lines. /v Indira should be nominated, very good expressions  /v Boring scene! one of many scenes I would fast forward!

With Cersei talking about Oberyn's death, it just reminded us why Ellaria did what she did...  To hurt Cersei.\n\nI actually felt bad for her and Tyene in this scene, which I didn't think was possible... /v But rosabell has the best tits I have ever seen /v You think you have enough videos to buffer for the next 2 years? /v Make a new skript of seazon 8, pleace!

They butchered the Dorne story x.x /v I was pissed that Bronn didn't come to the rescue of Tyenne.\nYou don't let the bad pussy go stale! /v Yea that canada goose jacket is keeping you warm in the dungeon :P /v Lena Headey makes Cersei one of the scariest villainesses, or should I say, lionesses in film history. /v Yeah, this scene was brilliant and all, but who the heck rules in Dorne now??? /v Is she alive? I am gonna miss her. /v Couldn't have happened to nicer people. /v Lena such a great actor! /v I was sad they died because bronn never got that bad pussy /v So it's all fluffing around the actors before shooting, but after the shoot you all boot off home and leave them stuck in their chains. Tisk tisk. /v Why is no one bringing us that there is still a huge army is Dorne that is not being used?? And surly someone was left in charge to run down while it's leaders were away, why can't the person(s) running dorne just send their army to join daenerys so long as she agrees to free to sand snakes + where the hell is the rest of the Tyrell army!?! /v Nice ,,, any one friendship me ???? /v Where tf are these episodes? Can't find them on HBO GO. /v  /v Rosabell is the hottest women  on the show /v I hope they show bad pussy tits one more time before she's killed off, those things were crafted by the many faced god himself /v what a sad day when the hottest girl in show is killed, haven felt this way since Rose. /v I hope yall realize how shit and unworthy of our money this season was. Like its been going down hill but to kill the sand snakes without giving them a proper story was fucked up. Cant wait to pirate season 8 /v check out THIS AMAZING ROCK cover of Got https://youtu.be/tbNdyQB8FkA /v It is so good to see Ellaria and Tyene alive and well. /v Does does official make cersei an even more ruthless ruler than the mad king? Can't imagine him doing something worse than this imo /v Cersei is way more interesting than Dany /v 0:29 I think they used a different take in the show, you could hear the desperation and almost a sense of innocence in Lena's voice in the final take. /v 0:00 looks like something you can get from the dark web /v She is bad ass villain /v I empathized with Cersei because all she did was for her children. I think she actually considered them more like extentions of herself. When they died, every excuse disappeared. She's pretty much sane. She had done stupid things, and now she's suddenly smart. It's because she didn't use her brains when she had children. Now she uses them. She's perfectly fine, and yet she's as cruel as before. I don't empathize with her anymore. Die, bitch! (Not triggered) /v I'm gonna miss Cersei when she's gone. She's so evil, ya just gotta love her. /v I don't care these , I only care Daenerys and season 8 /v What the fuck, where's the rest of the episode? 2 minutes ain't shit. /v I could watch that scene so many times, the acting in it is top notch /v One of my favorite scenes from season 7 /v Anybody's biggest wish to be a part of this incredible film crew or just me /v waiting for episode 4 video /v I don't want to marry the Frey girl. /v It was honestly a breathtaking scene. So well done. Thank you to the actresses and crew /v i'm not gonna lie...i was shitting myself during this episode, Oberyns death freaked the fuck out of me and i was expecting more of the same in this scene. Easily one of the most intense pieces of TV i've seen in a while /v As much I absolutely loved to see Ellaria finally get her much deserved dose of Karma from Cersei & as much as I totally loved seeing Euron butcher the other 2 Sand Snakes during the Greyjoy naval battle, I was really sad to see Tyene set up to die the way she did in Cersei's dungeons as she was the only Sand Snake that I did like even though she fucking killed badass Areo Hotah by stabbing him in the back which was lame. I'm still going to miss Tyene, definitely not going to miss Ellaria & her other daughters!!!\n\nI really hope that Ellaria realizes that thanks to her actions she has effectively rendered the once mighty House Martell, the house of her very own great love, completely & utterly extinct!!!\n\nOberyn may've been cocky & arrogant & vengeful but he was also very firmly against the idea of punishing children for the sins of their parents & he never would've allowed Ellaria to murder poor Myrcella!!! /v I masturbated to this scene, like 5 times in a row. /v I wanna buy some cool merch. Who else misses rep the realm collection??? /v 2019 for season 8 wtf guys cant wait so much time please kill me now and call lady melisandre and resurrect me when season 8 is out /v This was a throwback, to what the Mad King did to Rickard Stark, and Brandon Stark. /v https://youtu.be/pNYPuXUl_m0 /v Goodbye to the best tits in the entire series /v Cersei is the queen and wants to be the queen. Sooner or later Cersei always gets what she wants \nREPLY /v Lucifer Teaser Season 3 https://youtu.be/v5EzpvxhmuQ /v thats my cercei. /v Season 7 sucked already /v Te amo GOT ! /v Lena Headey, man. /v I love Lena. Amazing actress /v Best Revenge /v Dude we need bloopers /v Bota Legenda Em Portugus Do Brasil /v Ruined the sand snakes and Dorne! /v 1:35 - 1:45\nProp malfunction! /v Best fucking good bye /v Emmy Awards for Cersei please!!!

What's that? Sounds like a redundant redundancy to me... /v Maybe this was the cause of disco fever in that medieval village where everyone died /v And the best part? Many places still illegally dump stuff into our waterways. Climate change seems like a box of fluffy ducks compared to the horrors of irreversible polution of our food and water. /v This is silly! There was no need to use mercury to get acetylaldehyde; they could have just transfused Ted Kennedy's blood. PLENTY of acetylaldehyde there for industrial purposes! /v This has gotta be a CATastrophe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you kitten me? Stop it with the puns!\nAnother pun, and I'm gonna become CATatonic\nPlease help me I PURRgot what my name is\nHelp me I word forget like meanings and questions bean apple forever crying apple apple apple apple apple apple\nAhbwi aoajdnmwo sokajsk skjsnis xisjkwnizk wijsjajsh sijsjsjiwj Ijwnwjlws.d.........\n.....................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comment was found on the computer of a 19-year old man in Russia. His name is Alexi Cherekov \nHe died from an apparent stroke /v First thought was: Methylmercury = Birth control\nJudge me as you please. /v I first learned about this as a kid from the Dead Kennedys song Kepone Factory /v Chisso also use yakuza to death threaten and silents the victims. /v Always that corporate greed, I specifically study cases like this caused by corporations and governments and it's sad how often the value of profit over innocent lives is so easily taken as if these people had sold their souls to the devil. Whats worse is they are not punished enough for  the long term damages to their environment that equates pretty much to bio-terrorism and to people who did nothing wrong like he said people died and even worse developing babies were not even spared. If it were up to me  there would be no profitting off the death of innocent citizens and most of the board members  would be in prison for a really long time or on death row. /v How about linking to an Art Assignment or Crash Course history episode that describes why we even know all this - the activism and work of the incredible photojournalist W Eugene Smith and his Japanese wife - <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Uemura_in_Her_Bath rel=nofollow noopener target=_blank>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Uemura_in_Her_Bath</a> and <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Eugene_Smith rel=nofollow noopener target=_blank>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Eugene_Smith</a> /v really could have used this video a year ago when I had to do a report on Minimata Disease... better late than never, I guess? /v Aaaand in the least shocking twist ever, the people running the corporation killed a bunch of people and wouldn't take responsibility but somehow people still think that regulating corporations is bad. /v here's an idea: when ever these greedy corporate criminals want to dump poisonous elements, they can start with their own back yards. and they can let THEIR kids play back there. how would that be? /v Pet peeve is when Youtubers can't pronounce words from whatever country they are talking about. /v We know so much more about chemistry and biology than we did in the 1950s. The experts at the time thought these chemicals were safe to handle this way. \n\nRemember that...the experts thought they understood this. The experts who tell you everything is ok and say things tbey can't explain like diversity is a strength are often proven wrong after disasterous results. /v  Its all over for orangutans  /v @scishow QQ: why does skin get red and itchy when walking/exercising in the cold? /v Suggestion: Talk about MethylMercury poisoning in Iraq /v Came to see dancing cats, much disappoint. /v Can you do a video on radiotrophic fungi? /v Why do most women get a rash under her bra line? And how do you treat it? :) /v What happened to the president of the chemical corparation. Is he in jail, a free man or does he sleep with the fish? /v I am disappointed that you didn't make the cat-alyst pun /v We all knew the CATions on this video could've made a pun at CATalyst. Dang, he missed his chance! /v 1960's wasn't that long ago.  I wonder how we're poising ourselves today? /v I am a paramedic and jerking and maki g weird noises is called a seizure /v They destroyed the lives of thousands of people through their thoughtless and harmful industrial waste.  Those responsible should pay an eternal debt. /v Sponsored by the tourist board of Japan I guess. /v Free Market Almighty surely was displeased with the government's future meddling with Chisso Corp. These poor folks were simply punished proactively by the powers that be. /v These stories make me think of vigilante justice since the traditional justice system just doesn't work. Consider an experiment to determine if chemical company executives react the same way to such chemicals as people who aren't chemical company executives. All in the name of science! /v When I was a kid there was a pictoral article in Life Magazine. This video did little to convey the horror of what happened to these townspeople. I'm over 65 now and that one article remains as one of  the most traumatic things to ever happen to me. The horror of it can not be conveyed in words. You did an excellent job and I actually thank you for not including pictures of the victoms. /v 3:33 to 3:36 they would jerk around uncontrollably, making terrifying noises, then they would die. I was imagining cats masturbating to death. /v The cats spread their happiness to the humans. ;3 /v *what about the disaster of **music.ly?**?* /v You can also still find mercury in silver dental fillings...all of those are 50% mercury and still in use. /v Thanks for not showing us those poor cats.  I don't want to see that. /v I thought the video was going to be about the cute waving cats you see it oriental restaurants, boy was I wrong. /v and in immunity booster shots..1:18 /v off topic..but i always found it cooler to be a girl. can you make clones of men and remove the y chromosome and replace it with an identical x? i can't seem to find an answer online /v Did the townsfolk kill the head of the company? /v And I thought this monday couldn't get any more depressing... :/ /v Hmm, this made sense of the Bush song Disease of the dancing cats. /v Was Scott Pruitt head of the Japanese version of the EPA in the 60s before he came to the US? /v First cats then humans. That's just really sad. They should have done something the moment they saw something wrong with the cats!\n\nNormal people don't have anything to do with dumping mercury yet they still had to suffer for it! /v After watching this, I went through several Minamata disaster videos. They are just horrific. Death is far better than this disease. \nGod bless us. /v So when they talk about mercury poisoning in tuna, is it the methylmercury? This would make more sense as eating bigger, aka older fish (tuna...) would be more hazardous.  We won't have to worry about extinction..from asteroids...our corporations will do it for us. /v This is what regulations are for /v T-shirt game is on point for this one.... /v 4:54 The _government_ started to clean the bay. Why couldn't the Chisso Corporation be bothered? /v Read about this in This Borrowed Earth for my APES class /v a MAN made preventable disaster,   the CEO's and responsible parties in the chemical company should have been charged with man-slaughter, negligence and environmental destruction,  horrific /v There's a fantastic documentary called The Cove that talks about a lot of this. /v Don't you have a video of the dancing cats?? /v Actually...organic and inorganic compounds don't mix, LITERALLY like oil (organic) and water (inorganic). /v How and why the hell did I already know this... Can't even remember where from... /v No one else made note of no video visual? /v I love how you go more into the chemistry part! Thank you for this, super interesting /v Super informative, guys, thanks for the video! Never heard of this situation before, glad to see it brought out. /v But it gets worse.  The company basically said\n\nIt's so awful what happened to this quaint town.  Because we're so generous and care about our community, we're offering money to those affected.  Only condition is that you waive the right to sue us.  We wouldn't want to bite the hand that feeds us, right? /v Hank, I would argue that Methylmercury is not _the_ most poisonous form of the metal, but the _second_ most poisonous form of the metal. Dimethylmercury seems a lot more poisonous altogether, especially considering its immense ability to penetrate materials, and the fact that the most prominent recorded death from it, that of highly-trained chemistry professor Karen Wetterhahn, resulted from a few accidental pipette drops onto a latex glove. Her entire story can be found here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn), but the sheer toxicity Dimethylmercury demonstrated in this case resulted in its complete abandonment in all but extremely limited research settings. /v Its this kind of lazy that makes me feel guilty i'm as lazy....i am a Pateron though. /v Are mosquitoes more attracted towards a specific blood group? Please reply. /v So the cats were high on meth /v This video was released very coincidentally for me, I just started reading This Borrowed Earth which covered minamata disease in the first chapter! /v 1:22 DON'T EAT MERCURY. *Noted* /v Cat-alysts. /v https://youtu.be/ihFkyPv1jtU /v Why the fish unaffected? /v Hank doesn't disappoint. /v Mad Hatters disease /v CATalyst haha... /v CHEESS-SO! NOT SHISS OH! /v What a CATastrophe /v Hurrah unregulated Capitalism. /v Some lite bulbs have it slso /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9UfBkEuLXA /v :( /v Poor cats  /v poor kitties, /v Mercury is one of the nastier elements on the periodic table, which is why we don't use it so much anymore...\n\nYeah, except they do put it in the vaccines they keep pumping little kids full of these days. /v But it wasn't until 1968, twelve years after the first victims died, that the Chisso Corporation stop dumping the factories wastewater into the bay.\nWhile technically true, this is libel. Wastewater treatment plants were erected immediately after the discovery that mercury discharge was the problem. What took ten years was the discovery that the treatment process they used was not in fact catching all the mercury. Only then did they modify their processes to end the discharge of mercury. /v Cats will always be better than dogs. Believe me. This is true. You can take that statement to the bank. All the way there. You can take it there. There is whence mightest it shall not never not not go unless it will not go. Make America Great Again! /v How come people are so outraged about this but they aren't upset about the mercury used in vaccines and medications? (This is not an anti vaccine comment. It's an anti heavy/toxic metals comment.) /v What happened to the dickheads of the chisso factory? /v I don't care what happened to the people I'm only concerned about the cats /v HELLO BBs!! what do u think of my blindfolded outfit?? should i wear it again?? or buy more stuff? lol /v Hello! You can earn money by typing the product code at this link: http://xjderedrmo.date/7304331504103/ /v Saf still manages to produce a black outfit despite the fact she can't see. . /v How are you so effortlessly cool and awesome?!? /v How come, even blindfolded you look for black? Pure talent /v Her sense have shown her to the dark side. Black is her happy colour /v Are you from Denmark? /v At 9:06 I have those shoes /v How does she miraculously still get a black outfit... /v I know she said this isn't sponsored but this makes me feel like I'm sleeping on kohl's /v Do it again and if you choose anything black Tyler tells you, you can't have it!! Just cause I wanna see something crazy. Cause I love all black too. Shopping rule, If it's not black, put it back /v Literally shocked that you still got all black even while blindfolded! That is some meant to be shit right there haha. I was rooting for that jean top tho. And this was hilarious PLEASE do it again! I loved when you thought you were venturing out and you had just spun in a circle basically lol! /v did nobody else notice the person filming in the background at 7:23 or am i dumb /v Female clothes are so much better than male clothing (No I will not walk around in female clothing) /v Blindfolded, still finds all the black items. That's my girl ahah /v She must really be running out of video ideas /v I wanna try doing this /v i'm so sad that denim ruffle top with those jeans would've been KILLER /v The whole outfit is still black.  /v make Tyler do this /v Lol.. Everything she chose was black like her other clothes /v also your editing always looks so good i love it!!!!!! /v 7:23 who's that girl filming? /v Hahahahaha even with a blindfold, she still got all black  /v I love how even blindfolded she still gets black /v SAF: is that your bicep?\nTyler:yeahhhhh\nSAF: oh... Hi\n\nME. /v you should make a part 2, everything is black  /v I think her eyes were open /v oh no in that outfit you look like Jenny from the L word!!! nooooo /v I wish it was all different colors but whatever  /v She's blindfolded and still got all black!!! How is that possible!?!?  /v Do a house tour /v she managed to get all black...impressive /v that's funny u picked all black  /v I do not regret subscribing to u /v Saf: *shops blindfolded, still dressed in all black* /v 4:50 her excitment about snap off pants is hilarious /v She is LITERALLY attracted to black items! Lmao /v Wow all black she did good  /v I guess black was fate /v Id look like shit if I did this /v I have snap off pants from target and they are my favorite pants ever /v So even when she's blindfolded she can't get away from black /v I think she stole one of the chokers! /v I can't believe you got an entirely black outfit without seeing anything that's the most Saf thing to ever happen /v of course its all black hahaha /v You look so good in that outfit!! /v Hilarious as always! If I could make a suggestion, I'd love to see you try the Sleep Styler (shark tank product) or buy outfits from a sketchy ass website like zaful / rosegal etc., similar to the wish video :) /v The best things were the things she picked first & didn't get  like that denim top, or those jeans, and those embroidered sneakers /v Even blindfolded she chose all black /v For some reason, she reminds me of Chelsea from That's so Raven /v You should do a video where you buy the first 5 or however many things you see advertised in a #spon #ad post. Not stuff that was just inserted into your feed because a brand bought the space, but ads that people you already follow were paid to do. You could do it on Instagram, Facebook, Youtube.. the works!! /v Saf  how did you even pick black?! I loved this video so much /v you look like a hippie mom lol. No hate! Lovee /v You mostly wear black a lot /v im actually really happy you have left buzzfeed (not really but yea) you have so many different and entertaining ideas, your channel is so much better than buzzfeed /v it just looks like she doesnt have a good fashion sense is all /v You would make this a series /v When she said she was torn it would have been better if she was holding ripped jeans /v I think we need a redo. You magically selected all black. And this was funny. So please do it again....  /v This would be a really fun idea to do with friends for a night out- even if it was just top and bottom. You could go to goodwill and do it to make it really fun and then you have to go out to dinner and drinks with your outfit on. /v no matter what any clothes she buys will be black /v I dropped my phone in a puddle earlier and the speakers were kinda wonky. It was so weird when Saf did the 'echolocation' thing my speakers cleared up. Thanks Saf! /v It's all black /v you should buy clothes based on your zodiac sign /v Looked like she was going to a funeral /v PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN IT EAS FUNNYYYYY  /v this outfit is literally 2002 /v The outfit looks like something my teacher would wear /v She's So original /v Of course she choose all black!I guess it whispers her name /v Can you do the same thing but with makeup? Like if you agree. /v Am I the only one who wanted her to get all black /v Blindfolded and she still chose all black  /v she looks better blindfolded than i do able to see what im picking /v 10:08 She somehow still picked out black clothes! /v can you do a curology review? it's where you customize an acne wash for your skin type and apparently it clears your skin of pimples? /v Even while blindfolded you still managed to buy an all black outfit!!  /v All options she threw away would've made the outfit normal smhhhhh /v The way she said oh hi when she felt Tyler's bicep is me when I imagine touching a nice bicep /v I laughed so hard when Saf grabbed the first top and it was black /v You should do picking out ur makeup blindfolded like if you agree  /v DO THIS IN FOREVER 21 /v Who else saw the girl recording saf at 7:20 /v Do this with Tyler! /v a cat  /v blindfolded makeup shopping! /v 10:00 /v Oooh , its all black   /v Romwe hauul!! /v Still black  /v She looks like dua lipa  /v All black.

Hiii ;3 /v how is everything blackkkkkk wthh /v Damn /v Can't wait for you to do the iPhone X or 8 ! /v I was at a Sprint store watching this while I was waiting for the people in front of me so I could buy this at full price. Saw this walked out lol. One of the main reasons why I was going to buy it was because the titanium. It appears that this phone seems to naturally drop on the front and back like it's weighted to it hit the ground like that /v You seriously went to a kids park and shattered glass all over the picnic table area and into the grass? Good job! /v Jerry can u present me a phone that u have tested /v As you see... Droptests are what matters. No one scratches their phones with tools. No one gives a shit about scratch tests.\nHave you finally seen the light? /v Cant wait test on iphone X /v Do durability test for xioami mi 5x/mia1 plz /v durability test from iphone X pls :D /v Try maybe galaxy s8 and Sony xperia xz premium /v Iphone X durability test please  /v iPhone X please /v Dam apple respond that roast you did to them for no wireless charging and they got it in iPhone x I ain't apple fan /v Great video zack. That's some depressing bgm. Btw, will you do a durability test on sony's Xperia XZ1 Compact? /v The intro is bullshit so doing normal drop tests arent as useful as doing burn tests and the other stupid testting he does.. /v Surprisingly good, still returning mine because it's not worth it. /v Sorry -- better your phone\nrather than mine -- Thanks /v For the iPhone's 10th anniversary will you destroy 10 iPhone X's /v Do a durability test on the iPhone X and iPhone 8. /v What I wouldn't give to be that phone /v Zach, the iPhone X is out. How about a clear back?\n\n\nPlease /v What is your background music? /v He is look like jhonny  sins big brother /v u know what is a more decent idea than glass backs? Ceramic screens. /v What a shame for Gorilla glass 5. /v Oh dear essential - the iPhone 4 and note 2 faired better in similar drop tests. Doesn't look good for sales. /v How does he cover the barcode... /v Today weve learned that ceramic is stronger than gorilla glass. Who wouldve guessed. /v Dude! You should at least iron your shirt or throw it in the dryer before coming onto YouTube with a trashy look. Stay classy man /v Do a teardown of the apple watch series 3, I would love to see how they fit everything in there /v Pls test the new liquad glass they have out for smart phones /v Ceramic should be on the screen !! /v Who else believes phone companies purposefully cripple the strength of their screens so people have to buy new phones when the screens inevitably break? Heck, I've seen glass from corning that seems to be tons stronger then what they put on phones. Is this just me? /v make the phone clear whos with me h /v Super impressed with the titanium/ceramic combo durability here. Too bad about the screen though. /v Zack, how about growing ur hair first? /v My S8 back cracked on 1st drop from my lap. :'( I worked hard to get that phone but now I have to live with it for atleast 2 more years. /v I hope Samsung will use ceramic too for their new phones /v Hey jerry can you answer this question perhaps? so i have the samsung galaxy s8 and ever since ive activated bixpy things have happened such as bixpy waking up my phone screen for no reason even without me calling upon her, bixpy opening its homepage even while the phones locked. I set the bixpy app to factory reset which would be its state before i activated it, and now every so often within a longer interval of seconds the phone will wake itself up as if im pressing the power button. This even happens when i shut it down and its charging, i dont press the button yet the screen will wake up to show the percentage when its off or go to the screen before you unlock the phone while its on. What do you think the problem is? i dont know if its taxing on the battery when its on and it wakes the screen up but its rather annoying /v who wants hollywood to cast zack as the new hitman \ngimme a like and zack give me a heart plz /v Get a real job lol /v Why are you so SMART I'm jealous /v This video is the reason you are the only channel I still watch that tries to break phones. While others think that destroying phones looks cool, you actually care about accuracy. So just keep doing what your doing and Ill be here watching your videos. /v How about we get rid of gorilla glass  and replace it entirely with ceramic on flagships /v Could you do the Xiaomi Mi5s? /v Can you teardown nokia 8? On next video /v agent 47 is now droppin' phones for a livin' /v Waiting for Nokia 8 test and bend test /v After all the reviews on the iPhone 8 from other YouTubers, Jerry will do the ultimate challenge, the durability test. /v Please don't do drop tests, Youtube already full of those idiots with their stupid drop tests, like you said it's so random, unpredictable and proves nothing.\nI like how you do it for exceptional phones, felt curious and as well thought the ceramic would shatter first, but wow, ceramic isn't bad for phones after all.\nGreat job. Please keep it up like that Zack:) /v You are due more credit than you are given my friend. /v Did you... make a tripod out of anal beads? /v Can you do a test on Samsung galaxy j5 2017? /v Sooo... when are you gonna do a giveaway with that Tissot on your wrist? :D /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v You amaze me every single time. This time it was background music! /v Could you test the keyrocera dura force pro? /v Is it worth to buy a screen protector for an already broken device? (iPad Pro 10.5) /v ok ,, i need .. screen cover .. rather than back cover :D /v Great choice of music. So I guess Ceramic and Titanium are the way to go for premium phones? /v Jerry reminds me of johnny sins...pros  will understand!!!!! /v Have you done a durability test on a elephone 8? /v you should you Xperia XZ1  to record slo mo. /v I would love to see a scientific drop test, like simulating the drop on a specific side with a specific power. Tools can help you do that, i know you would want to try :) /v One of the best explained drop tests out there /v I dropped my S8 just like the first test in your video but on a wooden floor and ended up with a broken screen. Not only that, I was disappointed when I noticed scratches on the screen just after a couple of weeks of buying the phone and I realised later that they're caused by plastic rounded object in my pocket where I used to carry my phone. I had an S4 before I buy the S8 and I've used it for more than 3 years and till now it has no noticable scraches on the screen even that I used it the same way as I use the S8. /v this is why they should do metal only phones /v Coming soon:\n\n*Q* *U* *I* *N* *T* *E* *S* *S* *E* *N* *T* *I* *A* *L* Phone /v Tbh I'm kinda puzzled at the results of those new phones, I've just lost my 5 year old Galaxy Nexus because of circuitry problem (it simply doesn't boot up anymore) but with all the hits it took in those years it never shattered, it just got a small bumb in a corner of the glass that didn't even reach the screen. /v Gorilla Glass is just Marketing...they break easy /v i like drop test, can you do Xperia XZ Premium drop test? /v You should use Xperia xz premium for slow-mo..best of best /v Sir please give me mobile /v kids in africa could have eaten that phone /v Sold on Ebay as slightly used /v make a giftaway for that crack essential plss.. hahaha /v You did well. ! /v These spam bots are on steroids /v Mi mix /v iphone x /v sir..can you plz do #mi a1 durability test I'm waiting frm long tym plz /v Great work agent 47 /v zack   zack   bend iphone /v Do lg v30 bend test pls /v THE MUSIC XD /v do durability test of sony Xperia XA1 /v Nice /v Duablility test the new iPhone x /v Drop test Mi Mix 2 /v JerryHypnotizeEveryone /v On cement - pissed off civil engineers incoming /v Gravity lmao /v Waiting for Honor 8 Pro Durability test /v Could you please test lenovo zuk z2 plus /v Those background sounds though...  /v my eyes /v you're really hot... /v Obi SF1 Teardown please /v Epic channel guarantee sub /v Jerry please test Meizu Pro 7 Plus!! /v As a cautious cell phone user, I think gorilla glass its pure junk. I have, accidently, ruined 6 phones in 13 months (thank you One Plus 3). one waste high drops.  Pulling out of the pocket and landing on a raised floor with ring screen protector shouldn't cause this much problems. Ceramic, clear front screens and plastic (damn easy scratching) are the only acceptable future thus far. 1000 dollars ruined because it gets caught on your pocket (or anything) shouldn't require a new screen. (which I also repair myself) /v AHH NEW INTRO!!! Who else misses #schoolisha tho? haha Don't worry though cause I have SO MANY awesome videos planned for you guys!

I was so pumped for that and it's been a while since you posted a video.  /v i love your channel! /v Can someone please let me know why I am not able to view Ingrid's previously live videos? My notification said she had a live unboxing today yet her channel doesn't show me the live videos. I am able to see other youtuber's previously live shows though...anyone? /v Does anyone else get reminded of the Saw movies when they see Target's logo?  /v It's so weird seeing aritzia in LA hauls now Bc for the longest time it's been just a Canadian thing :O /v Ingird, can you do an updated room tour ? Thanks! /v Tutorial on this makeup look?? /v Where is the thermal turtleneck from??!! /v Haters don't know what to comment after this drugstore haul ;) /v Ingrid I love you!!! Pls pls make more videos  /v You are welcome US for finally getting Aritzia, from Canada, with love   Aritzia is a danger zone store for me! /v Does anyone know what lipstick she's wearing?? /v Do you have issues with getting small holes in your t shirts? I don't know if it's just because I purchase cheap shirts, but I'm hesitant to splurge because I'm afraid it may happen anyways /v This video gave me life. /v the similar Aritzia zipper body suit you have in the description looks like nothing like your vid. /v So close to 4 million!!! Congrats :) /v Ingrid, the Aveda shampure dry shampoo is a dry shampoo powder! It's my HG! I think the scent of it is right up your alley!! /v Aritzia always has the cutest things. Great video Ingrid. /v Please do a closet tour /v I still remember when you used to wear that panda sweater  /v Her style is soo modern and plain...not my favorite haul /v I love Lauren Conrad and Lucy Hale. my two favorites for makeup/hair/style inspiration. =D /v why is she losing subscribers she is amazing! /v Lol Ingrid if you like Aritzia then you would probably love their annual warehouse sales in Vancouver! /v Yes!!! I am the exact same way about my t shirts!! The sleeves have to be longer and the fit has to be right...it is SO hard to find them haha so thank you for the recommendations, I will have to go get me some!! /v Where did you get the faded black shirt? @IngridNilsen /v Omg I like my t-shirts the same way you described yours! /v I miss Vlogmas /v Hi Ingrid! I really loved your make-up in this video! Could you please teach us? Thanks! /v Eyebrows look funky for some reason...it's either too far apart or too square. My opinion.... /v Ingrid, what is the lipstick you're wearing in the video? I've been trying to find a shade like that for ages and it's been a trial and error kind of thing because, as you pointed out, you can't try drugstore makeup out before buying it so I've been getting these shades and have been really disappointed. Also, is that lipstick you have something you would recommend? /v What camera lens and settings are you using? It looks amazing! /v You should check out a brand called everlane  /v Ingrid!!! I love your shoes! What brand are they?  #havetohave /v Wait I thought she lived in NYC did she move back to LA? /v Omg I recently just got the Wilfred Free tshirt in the nude color too! BEST tshirt ever  /v you are gorgeous without (and with) makeup !! <3 /v FYI that Aritzia thermal stretches out quite a bit so I size down! /v omg I am obsessed with that red sweater!! /v omg please let us know your review on kristin ess products because i've been wanting to try them for a bit /v I love these types of videos! I hope we get an update video soon! /v Love your current hairlength! Great video Ingrid :-) lovely greetings from Austria /v how old is she? /v I'm pretty sure I've seen the batiste xxl powder at ulta /v this is literally my perfect closet, simplicity in details. I LOVE YOU! <3 /v Am I the only one sad that aritzia is becoming basic more than outside of Canada /v I love your videos  /v Stop being so cuteeeee i can't handle your cuteness /v Love the black body suit with the zipper and the printed pants! /v Love that Zara floral number!! /v target has some really cute fall clothes and shoes right now! xo from my channel to yours <3 /v I love Ingrid but I think it's missing a little floral dress, like that :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syofDm2KhW8 /v Crying because Ingrid looks amazing in this video! /v Will you update us on the hair products once you've used them up a bit? /v High rise, button-fly tapered jeans. Yep, the 90's are definitely baaaaaack!  /v Love the longer hair /v i absolutely love aritzia! for some reason the store on 5th ave in NYC feels quite intimidating though, wishing it was more like the LA store! /v Better wear the two floreal pieces not together else they look like a fancy pajama XD /v Ingrid are you still focusing on ethical/sustainable fashion? or are you going to revert back to fast fashion? /v Omg you finally look like your old self!!! /v Ingrid, I really think you should read up on Zara and it's production chain. They're truly not a company worth buying and supporting. I hope you look it up! <3 /v Sending love your way  Great video! /v The clothes look cute tbh, but sucks I can't afford it :( /v Aritizia here in Canada is over hyped AND overpriced imo. Not to mention the salespeople are not helpful if you don't shop there all the time. /v The jeans look so good /v I NEVER CLICKED ON A VID SO FAST. I GREW UP WATCHING HER FALL HAULS IN HIGH SCHOOL, SO THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY  /v That batiste powder is definitely available at ulta. Just FYI for anyone interested. :)\nLove your style Ingrid! And this vid got me even more excited for autumn ! /v open your description and zoomed right to the red sweater and WAH WAH WAHHHHHHHHH dang it zara!!! why you gotta do me like that!! /v Everlane has great tshirts! /v Hehe I work at Aritzia :) /v The lip color is beautiful. May I ask what color/colors you're wearing? /v does anyone know what lipstick shes wearing?! /v Yaaaayyy love your longer hair:) /v that red oversized sweater from zara looks gorgeous ahhh that color!!!  /v So glad you included affordable options! /v Ulta carries the Batiste XXL powder. /v You look so pretty /v OMG YES /v Always love your fashion hauls!  /v Burst treaty fault care blind break. /v I love your hair guuurl! <3 /v Mmm yessss so ready for fall! /v <3 love you!!!!! /v Love, love, LOVE the kristen Ess products! /v Honest Beauty reviews: \nhttp://normalhumanreviews.blogspot.co.uk/?m=1 /v Loving the red sweater  /v What lipstick are you wearing?? /v Dude, dont buy L'Oral! /v  /v You still wear the camo leggings from HPE? /v Awesome! I LOVEEE LUCY HALE, and Lauren Conrad so I'm sooo buying those products by Kristen. I had no idea that was even at target; thankful you mentioned it. \n\nI wear my hair naturally which is pretty much beach waves almost daily. Super excited to try it!  /v Ingrid! Please do more of your 'fashion foreplay'!! Would love to see your outfits for fall this year:) /v i am obsessed with the dry shampoo! /v I don't trust any products she recommends anymore because half the time I don't know if its a secret ad or if she actually uses them /v I haven't seen a single video of Ingrid in aaaaaaages and omg she's so skinny now???????  /v I have no idea how to dress trendy inexpensive for each season. Most of my closet is filled with clothes I half-like from freshman year of college... i'm now a senior and saving up every penny for an apartment in NYC after I graduate, any tips or recommended stores? /v Loved this vid Ingrid! Thanks for sharing your haul. Your basics style is super inspiring! I love the palette of tshirts you have and that floral pant/long jacket set was gorgeous xxxx /v This makeup looks dirty :/ /v Rick does NOT fit most of the requirements of being a narcissist.  Most of those requirements require Rick to be delusional in each respect.  Rick is NOT delusional.  What makes Rick so special is that he does rightfully deserve being able to act like a narcissist without BEING one. /v I have made an analysis video of the last episode, what a story !\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evD1Pdb7FLw /v the sound of ever new slide is annnnoying as fuck /v lol you can't use the episode of the sigerian scammers for any examples. Rick was smart enough to know from the moment Morty ran into the garage wall that Morty was a digital projection aannnd etc throughout the episode. /v Whoa, whoa, whoa! Exaggerates his achievements? Not Rick. That motherfucker gets shit done! /v My theory is that the Rick we see is from another universe that he came over to his first current one we see him in because that Rick died, which explains the 20 year gap, why he sees Morty as a kid etc. I however do not think that evil Morty is his original Morty, because if that was true Morty would have more evil characteristics as the standard. Since he is the Rickest Rick, I know this might be wrong, but I honestly feel that if evil Morty is his original, it would be to simple and not have the mind screw part that Rick&Morty is famous for. /v Damn the detail in this video... /v Everyone saying Rick isn't a narcissist needs to realize that he literally tells toxic Rick that he had his narcissism removed. So not only is he a narcissist, but he's aware that he is. /v I don;t know if narcissists are insecure but if they aren't, Rick definitely isn't one. /v there's a lot of videos on youtube exploring the philosophy and psychology of Rick and Morty, but this video is the deepest. BY FAR.\nThank you so much ScreenPrism <3 /v Please do one on Johnny from The Room - Tommy Wiseau! /v To be fair you can't say that Rick exaggerates his claims when he really is the smartest being in the multiverse. /v Excuse me, but it's just a cartoon. /v This video just made me realize how shitty my existence is. I see myself in Rick. Except for the intelligent part. Hahaha  /v You ruined the fucking show for me thx /v Don't be so rickulously /v A narcissist exaggerates shit but Rick actually does what narcissists think they do , so is he a narcissist or just a totally fucked up god /v I don't know why people have such high regard for this cartoon, philosophies are just like religions, beliefs and not fact. /v He's not a narcissist. /v Damn girl, Rick and Morty and Game of Thrones  I'm falling in  /v Holy shit my mind is blown /v He has reversed the concept of acting in bad faith. That refers to your reaction to limited choices. Rick has limitless choices. /v This video made me realize I'm a narcissist.  Damn it. /v Evil Morty has the same intelligence as c137 Rick. Rick tought him or artificially made him into a genius. I dont know what happened but some betrayal had to happen. /v When will the answer come? Why do not all people love President Donald J. Trump? He is making America so great. Everything is awesome. I love our Commander in Chief. He is a fine fellow. /v Deep. I just see Back to the Future mixed with parodies of pop culture. But that is just me. /v Why do only bots comment on your videos? /v why is Morty a Morty? /v Evil Morty is now president of the new citadel (under reconstruction) /v How was it in the latest episode the one Rick didn't know how to make Portal Gun juice? Shouldn't all ricks know how to make it? /v He's not a narcissist; he's Rick and the smartest man in the multi-verse; deal with it summer /v Death is an insult /v The rickest Rick of all. /v What if Beth's mom was that petrified creature that Rick killed first before failing to kill himself? /v I think the pickle Rick episode explained Rick's behavior the best why Rick is such a Rick but your doing good to /v I think that he's more a sociopath than a narcissist. While he feels superior, he's aware of many of his shortcomings and mistakes and his depression implicates a low self esteem. I think he hates himself and has even less love for others making him both ruthless and reckless. He further believes in the strong eating the weak and he does not believe in moral values. Still, he's not a psychopath, since there are moments where he does care about things other than himself and psychopaths don't suffer depression or would ever breakdown like he did in Ricklaxation, nor would they ever love someone. /v he doesnt exaggerate his abilities, and he does have a weirdly high tolerance for alcohol /v Song that starts at 8:39? /v 100k and it's trending? /v EVIL MORTY is in the new episode /v I'm still not totally unconvinced that Rick will become real, step through my screen and shoot me in the face with a 9 gauge plasma pistol. /v Wow\nI just noticed that Rick had memories of picking up baby Morty back when Evil Rick was downloading his memories\nMaybe Rick abandoned Evil Morty after he saw what a monster he had grown into\nEvil Morty knew he couldnt have his Grandfather back so he settled on taking his memories instead\nIdk i may be wrong but Rick picking up Baby Morty raised many questions cuz Rick had abandoned his family right until Morty turned 14\nGreat video btw :D /v Why is Rick such a dick? /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v Well the first part is inly partly true, but all his behaviors are fine cuz he can do anything hes know as the smartest man in the universe and multiverse lool /v this proves how great of a show it is /v Hi guys, please subscribe to my channel, every day a new video :) /v Thing about the memory of Rick holding Baby Morty is that the conclusions drawn from it in this video shouldn't be drawn quite so hard, as it is entirely possible that Rick snuck in to Beth & Jerry's life to check out his grandson unnoticed. Always irks me when people say so that couldn't have been current Morty.\n\nReally great video, otherwise. Utterly adore this channel. /v It's hard to call him a narcissist when he is fucking right about everything, always achieves impossible feats, and truly has no peer, just makes him self aware i think. /v The entire time I was wishing she'd shut the fuck up so I could enjoy the show,\n                                    *PSYCHOLOGY = PSEUDOSCIENCE*\n\n...\n*I'm Pickle Rick bitches!!!* /v It's simple when you can change your reality at any point then nothing matters. It's the true postmodernist lifestyle nothing is in reality and due to that you become cynical and very nihilistic. And since you control the past present and future everything becomes about you. Which is why it would be point less to even be around someone like that, you'd say the sky is blue and he'd say red, go back in time make it red and then you're wrong. He'd get a rush by being always right and have to top himself constantly until he becomes so depressed he just ends all life to test himself to bring all life back. /v Incorrect the fictitious family was not accidentally killed if they ever existed. /v Rick thinks he's special? naa man he is so special. He's the smartest man in the universe, and has power to basically do anything. /v Real meaning: Why Rick such a Di#k /v 70,000 views and it's 23 on trending! /v He doesn't really have infinite families. Majority of the other family members are VERY different in other universes. There is a finite curve that exists and shows how even in a sea of infinite universes there is a finite amount of inhabitable ones or ones that are similar enough to ours. There may be an infinite amount of universes, but the finite curve let's Rick know he can't do it at will. When they moved universes in season 1, Rick said himself that they only have a few universes left that fit Rick's criteria for a suitable home. /v I really don't like the citadel(?) episodes because the Ricks are so un-Rick-y. They're actually pretty dumb. /v For a moment, I thought the thumbnail said Why is Rick such a Prick /v More like Why is Rick Such A Dick /v Why is rick such a dick :v /v awesome as always you should do stranger things next....:) /v I had a whole comment written out explaining just how but it's not worth it  \n\nThis video is bad. \n\nIt's boring, contrived, and just fails to understand R&M at a fundamental level. /v Wait what if evil morty is the morty from ricks original dimension with beth, and abandoned that dimension too /v Wow, just as insightful as wisecrack. How do yall not have more subs?. Keep it up /v Morty = young version of rick\n\n Evil Morty = young version of evil rick /v Rick isn't a narcisist, he is simply put just a nihilist. Let us look at the describtion:\n>>Nihilism (/na.lzm/ or /ni.lzm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\n\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\n\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character. Now if that would be true, it would be really a way of breaking the 4th wall. /v Cause he's the Rickest Rick of all Ricks /v Incredibly well done. /v Wubalubadubdub!!! Ahah ahaha! /v PICKLE RIIIIICCCKKK /v If rick is so smart that he's aware of being in a cartoon does that mean that Mr.poopybutthole is just as smart as he is because he's aware of being in a tv show as well? /v Wow wow wubbzie /v Okay, i'm Rick /v 1:03 same /v R&M=Best mind fuck ever /v Hawkkkk hawkk /v Because he wants that szechuan sauce /v Ohhhhhhh boy. Oooooooo weeeeee /v http://piff.me/4a7a834\nhttps://youtu.be/as9BNv7IzSQ\nhttps://SoundCloud.com/ivyrosetv914\n\nCheck me out  /v Dude, stop being a rick. /v 31 on trending /v PICKLE RIIIICK /v Morty SMITH!? /v Ricki Tiki Tavi BITCHES /v Good vdo I like /v http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=52570 /v Hm /v Lol /v Evil Morty?

Ricks exist for a reason /v You've added too many attributes to the definition of a narcissist a narcissist to someone who basically does not comprehend that there is anyone more important than themselves and that anyone has anything that can't be cancelled or postponed to accommodate the needs of the narcissist.  You combined it with a sociopath. /v I used to enjoy rick and morty. But then the fan base came along and ruined it.

I don't really know, I want to talk to my mom but sometimes shes like you are just finding out diseases that you see on the internet or stuff like that and this really sucks because I can't enjoy my life when I'm spaced out and I really hate it.\nThank you so much for doing this video, I'm going to show this to my mom and ask her for help<3 /v For the first time I dissociated an event this last week. A friend was in a car accident and i witnessed it all in my rearview. It was terrifying- I thought he was dead. I vividly remember detail and images, but throughout the experience never felt present. Even now a week later It doesn't feel like an even that happened. I wonder if derealisation is something that ive had, and this event only magnified it. For some time now I feel somewhat absent minded, and can't remember most of my day or week. Only more recently have I looked into it more but I dont know where I am as far as set label i guess. /v I don't know what I have like I always have time slip through my one ear and the other like I can't remember simple things like conversations I had today and when I look in the mirror for to long I look different, like not myself. Does anyone know what I have? /v I think my worst problem with experiencing derealisation(other than ya know, dissociating for weeks at a time) is that I know exactly what triggered it but it wasn't traumatizing in any way. It was like a switch in my brain which caused panic attacks that lasted so long that I numbed my emotions into derealisation and it's just confusing. /v This is very helpful!! I have a dissociative disorder (including derealization/depersonalization) and it's very nice that you opened up about it!! DR/DP is very scary to experience sometimes and it's great that you're spreading knowledge. /v @doddleoddle Derealization is talked about in the song Anziety by Logic, if you haven't heard it. Thank you for making this video <3 /v This was so informative and helpful. That shattered marble like clicks perfectly to what sets me off sometimes. I hope that I can find a group near me to just feel the same around and talk about it. /v this was a really helpful video!!! thank u dodie /v This is a strange state to be in. I feel dead inside..like I'm in a sort of purgatory...just observing unable to participate..for me it started out very vibrant, clairvoyant and i was full of life (for the first time) for about 2 months..then it cascaded into this place of isolation and disconnectedness. Calling it depression isn't quite right...because that would be a sensory experience. /v THIS WAS EXCELLENT IM DEFINITELY SUBBING HER /v I immediately recognised Kati from that one Always open episode that I put in my then-newly-established Important things playlist. So now I have a ton of collab videos in my watch later playlist... Time to get to watching ~ /v one of the first medications I tried was Zoloft, and it didn't work for me at all. I've been on medication since I was about 13 or 14, and I didn't find (what I think is) the right medication until I was about 16, and even now, my doctor checks with my medication and considers changing my cocktail of meds! :) i'm afraid of therapies like TCMS because I'm not really familiar with it and I'm afraid that it will be dangerous! I've only tried CBT, and I didn't feel like it worked for me. I am trying a new therapist at the end of the month, though, so we'll see how that goes! /v I'm pretty darn sure I don't have any of these but I still experience this stuff on occasion. Is that normal? Just like sudden moments of self-awareness like I am a human I could be seeing colors that are not anyone else's colors what does water taste like and weird stuff like that, but not very often. /v i had a panic attack today in class and i didnt know what was going on but now i know it was dissociation /v i remember seeing a post on tumblr of the behaviors of depersonalization and it hit me that this could be what was wrong with me. i researched it for like a week and saw myself in almost all of the signs. i brought it up to my mom and she didn't even ask why i thought i felt this way. all she said was you can't believe everything you see on the internet i'm still very sure i suffer from this. i don't even recognize myself in the mirror or pictures anymore. i almost caught myself asking my friend who this strange girl was in our group photo. i'm so so tired. and i don't know what to do. /v when Kati said mindfulness, it made me wonder ... have you tried/considered trying meditation? /v Wow this explains so much for me. I've struggled with all of these due to mental illness and trauma since I was a child. Thank you for this video. /v When my derealization gets really bad I become paranoid about if my reality is real and feel like I'm trapped in a dream and I'm on the brink of lucidity in the dream, just not quite there. I focus on specific things happening in the environment and with my body and tell myself these are the things I will remember from the dream when I wake up (but I am awake, so when I'm asleep). As a writer, most of the stories I write involve parallel/multi-layered realities, so I've labeled my derealization as moments of inspiration because I'm in the head space of the stories I write. /v i think i have this ??? a few days ago after an assembly at school i got up and went to class but as soon as i started writing everything seemed so blurry and i couldn't get my brain to process that everything was real and i felt like i was in a dream. ppl's voices seemed far away and i felt like i couldn't move but when i did it hurt really bad. and after the bad part stopped i  just felt so empty ?? i didn't feel like i could really fEEEL my emotions the whole day + everything that had happened didn't feel real and it made me feel so empty and disconnected for the rest of the day. + it's been happening quite often since then. welp that's enough of dec ranting bye  /v i am soooooo happy that dodie talks about this. this helps me soooo much. just the fact you can recognize these things and not feeling alone! im soo happy with this! there are no words for the gratefullness i feel right now. i love you for that /v i have derealisation/depersonalisation and i've heard from so many different places that the best thing to do is to talk to someone, but i don't have anyone to talk to. i feel like none of my friends would take me seriously, or even think i made this up for attention. what should i do? /v I do this, I didn't know it was a thing! I used to do it subconsciously, zone out when I got stressed, but I've trained myself to do it manually. /v Thank you so much for explaining, now i understand it better and i dont feel like a drama queen or something anymore /v Fastest 10.5 minutes of my life /v been a waitin for this /v She is so incredibly interesting! I could listen to her for hours. and this video kinda explains what I've been feeling for a while.  /v I couldn't stop staring at Kati. She has something mesmerizing, I don't know if it's the way she talks, acts, her mimics... is that weird ? XD /v i get something familiar sometimes. i sometimes feel like i've gone numb and i feel slightly 'spaced out'. it's confusing :/ /v Thank you so much, Dodie. I have been struggling with this for so long and it comforts me to know that I'm not the only one out there. /v This was really helpful, thank you! /v thank you for making me be more aware. thank you for making me research and learn. i love you. thank you. /v I rarely comment on videos when on YouTube as I have a lot of anxiety surrounding interaction with people at any level, online or in person but I wanted to share this poem I wrote some time ago, and this community always seems so nice. I think it describes some of the feelings I was going through at one time in my life and watching your videos has made me think I may have been experiencing some form of depersonalization....\n\nIs this face mine?\nIt blinks in time with I\nWhen blue it too sinks, to a sadly painted hue\nIn its cheeks\n\nAnd as I, walk and talk my way through time\nIt too ages with the mind\nforming every crease and every line\nI question still:\nI may be real but is this face mine?\nOr is it merely borrowed to one day be returned?\nTo trade in all that I have loved and all that I have learned\nFor another soul to grow old,\nOnly to ask a question asked through time\nIs this face truly mine? /v This is super interesting and it actually helped me understand a few things about myself. /v I've had derealisation since I was really young but I never knew what was really happening. Lately I've just started to think it was something related to my anxiety. Thank you so much for making this video and explaining all of this it really helped. /v This was so interesting! /v Even if I don't have derealisation or depersonalisation I have that kind of thoughts sometimes and I had anxiety and depression all this year and all your videos helped me so much. You talking about all this things makes me feel good because I found someone who knows what I went through all this months because even though there are a lot about mental illness in pages, there are not many people who actually suffers it and talks openly about it. Thank you so much Dodie. I know you're going to get out of this and that you're going to be able to feel yourself again. /v Thanks for this fantastic video! During my worst stages of anxiety I experienced depersonalisation and derealisation for 3 months straight. Luckily through coping techniques and talking through my trauma I overcame it and haven't felt this way in years. You got this Dodie!  /v Hi Dodie! \n\nLet me first say that I love your music and your videos! They make my day better :)\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that I'm a 20 year old Music Education student and I was wondering if music therapy could be an option that you've considered for derealization/depersonalization. I'm not a doctor, but I do strongly believe in the results that music therapy can bring. I'd like to maybe know your thoughts about it too :) Does Britain have any programs like this (I'm from Canada and I do know it's becoming more popular here)? Could this be another helpful thing for people with this disorder?\n\nI don't want to seem bossy or anything; I'm just curious about what you think and I'd like to help in any way that I can haha. \n\nKeep making videos Dodie and keep being an inspiration because you are doing amazing things :) Thanks :) /v thank you dodie for uploading this video. I understand more about derealisation and know there are other mental diseases out in the world noticed. Maybe I do have something or maybe I don't. Overall, you made my eyes open and make me feel real for just at least some minutes. /v I feel like I have dissociation, but it's not during moments of stress or trauma. It's mainly brought on by being awake in the middle of the night. Could being awake really late cause a trigger in my brain? /v Thank god ive found the name for this. I'm already feeling a lot better. /v I posted a comment on here before, but the question just occurred to me. Has anyone down here in the comments gone through dp/dr and came out of it?  Best of luck to you Dodie. I'm actually in the UK now and it'd be amazing to meet someone else that's experiencing the same thing. Best of luck to you<33 /v I usually don't comment on this type of stuff, I doubt anyone will even read this but I don't know what's wrong with me. Everything feels like a dream. It doesnt feel real. I don't really have past traumatic events. I don't know why nothing feels real or why I get sad and tired all the time. I make myself busy doing stuff to try to distract myself and it doesn't work a whole lot. For some reason I feel not as sad currently and it changes from extremely sad to almost okay. When I'm upset I can't imagine what it was like to be happy. I write stuff when I'm sad and when I'm happy I'll read it and be like how did I ever feel this the main thing that messes me up is time. Stuff is over too fast and time just feels very weird /v wow I've had derealization and depersonalization and I didn't know what was wrong but this helped me out so so much. I just didn't feel like I was there and I didn't feel like I was my self. I have more memories with my derealization because it used to happen A LOT. I never knew what was wrong. During those episodes I don't like talking to anyone because it makes me feel more out of myself. Thank you soooo much /v This video made me realize that I have had moments of derealization and depersonalization in the past. Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel! Thank you so much for making this video, it helped me a lot! \nLots of love! /v my? two? favorite? people? in? one? video???? I'm shook , I lo ve y a l l  /v i'm not sure i have dissociation/depersonalization/derealisation? idk, i have long periods where my brain feels disconnected from my body... kinda like,, floating in the space above my head? weird concept i know,, and i don't feel like i have any emotion and every feeling- physical or emotion- is like dulled at the edges and sometimes lights can seem too bright and everything i hear seems like white noise. i don't really have trauma tho so idkkkk i feel like i'm being dramatic and unnecessary /v The bit about the marbles was SO INTERESTING AND EYE-OPENING I never thought of trauma that way. I treated it as a single marble I wouldn't stop picking up instead of something that's been shattered/dispersed through everything. /v tbh the inside out analogy made a lot of sense /v okay i need help. sometimes i get a feeling that sort of sounds like this but i dont know if it is or not. for example the other night i was in the backseat of my friends' car on the way home from a movie and idk why but she started tickling me as a joke and we were laughing and i was squirming and as i bent over to hide my face from her, i just felt this really weird wave of disconnection. like i was floating outside of my body, and i couldnt feel myself smiling or smell anything and all the sounds around me went hazy, like i was under water. it happened again twice that night when i was just sitting there in the car, not even laughing and moving around anymore. its happened more times for sure but that was the most recent. is this something to look into? /v I zone out when I'm stressed and start to be quiet and sometimes I do it in class and it scares my teacher  ;-; and I todally feel like I'm not here or like life is just a dream when it happens /v that was so educating and well illustrated, i love it!! /v I think I might have derealization, but like you when it's at its worst depersonalization. Honestly to me it's really terrifying. I don't fell like I'm here and that I'm in a dream. I really wish I could talk to a parent but they'd think I'm just going through a phase or being over dramatic. I really wish I could figure out what's wrong with me... \nBut I just wanted to say thank you so much dodie. Thanks to you, I figured some things out and why I'm feeling like this. Not everything of course, there's still a lot I don't know. But videos like these really help  ilysm /v OMG... I think I may have this... I go into this state of mind where it's feels like I'm dreaming and it's hard to control my body and what's going on... and I start to panic before and after it happenes... I have never heard of this and I thought it was just me... but like everyone thinks I'm crazy when I tell them /v Welp I relate /v I finally know what to call this feeling;;; /v this was super interesting to hear about, my knowledge of mental illnesses was super limited up until recently and i find learning new things like this, thought it is sad its kinda at your expense... /v I'm really reluctant to say that anything's wrong with me given that I'm so young, I've never had anything traumatic happen to me and I generally have a good memory, but I looked up a list of dissociation symptoms on a very reliable health website and I related to 8 out of 10 of them. /v Katiiii! I love this woman. Her videos saved my life, particularly her video on intrusive thoughts. I have severe OCD and I had a random spike in 2015 and I was very close to ending my life when I came across Kati's videos. If you're reading this Kati I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.  /v i don't know why i'm crying halfway through but thank you for this. <3 /v So informative and helpful thanks lovely girls x /v As someone who also suffers from derealisation and depersonalisation and is constantly told by therapists, I don't know what's wrong with you, or I don't know how to help you, this video was endlessly helpful for me. Thank you  /v When I got trama last year in my freshmen year and my way to cope was talking to myself which then turned into a imaginary friend. This friend then began becoming abusive (since they were my own thoughts) and kept me up at night. I haven't talked about it with anyone cause I'm 15 and I feel like they'll think I've gone mad... /v I'm always so confused how you can like test if you have depersonalisation or derealisation because how can I know that I feel spaced out? Like sometimes I feel like in a dream but then I'm like: ah no it's real and that's it idk it's weird /v I think beginning to try and get out of your state ( whatever your problem is, wether it's depersonalisation/realisation or anxiety ) is the first step and maybe hardest, for some people, towards healing... /v loved the description of the childhood little Ts as i've never really thought about it in that way before! /v I have the same glasses, but in pink :)) /v I don't have depersonalisation or derealisation but watching this was really interesting and really quite soothing. I feel like when I come to a mental block I can use some of these tips so thank you :-) /v Isn't it annoying when you have to go back and pause the writing that's on the screen for 2 seconds for comic effect /v holy shit. I think i have derealization. i always feel like i'm not actually 'there' like it was all a dream. i thought it wasn't a mental illness i always thought that it's just me being weird? but i didn't have any traumatic past though. i'm really scared. /v thank you. i really needed to hear this today, knowing that im not alone and that what i feel is valid <3 /v This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe  /v When I get really depressed I don't recognise myself. Like I'll know I'm the one moving my body but it doesn't feel like me and when I look into a mirror I know it's my face because I know I'm looking into a mirror but I don't recognise it.\nThe longest that it has happened for one time was about a week\n\n*edit* When you were talking about small childhood issues that weren't that big but seemed worse at the time. At one stage the back of my hands were hit with a wooden spoon until my knuckels were bleeding, things like that still dont seem like a small issue /v Schema therapy is amazing! I have tried a bunch of meds, general talk therapy, CBT, TMS, a bunch of things in an intensive outpatient program, and they helped but none as much as schema therapy. /v I have no memory of my childhood, my brain repressed every memory because of a really big trauma that happened to me when I was 5 /v This was wonderful 'cause I learned so much! Thank you Dodie and Kati! /v To me, looking in a mirror is a scarrest part of depersonalisation because you start to realize so well that something is wrong. Luckily I haven't experienced this for a long time like now it happens only when I'm extra tired and sad, it feels like your body tries to protect you /v I cannot tell you enough how much this type of videos helped me! Really, really from the bottom of my heart thank you. /v when i was younger i used to feel like i was trapped in my body and that my hands weren't my part of my body and now i'm just realizing i am mentally ill /v This is amazing. I truly understand and also deal with this. Dissociation is so hard and scary. /v Hi! I have a question/need advice:\nI took a math test yesterday and as I started getting more stressed because of time, I could feel myself getting more and more sucked away. After I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna finish it, I decided to do the easy ones on the back, but I couldn't even remember how to do a simple factoring problem. My mind wasn't there at all. I was wondering how to fix this/bring my mind back when this happens? When it does come back after I get out of that situation, panic attacks come on because everything rushes at me at once. Any ways to bring my mind back to focus WHILE it happens, then not get flooded afterwards? /v yesss! i love kati ahhh /v Oh my goodness...:( /v Can someone help me figure out whats wrong with me?? I have a constant state of feeling like I'm forgetting to do something (when I'm not), or that I should be doing something else. I'm often not content with anything I'm doing or feel uncomfortable with things i accomplish. Sometimes I feel better about it and other times it spikes, often after I go out to have fun or a major important event happens in my life. Can someone associate this with anything? /v I have a few kinda medium-sized rather recent traumas, and my therapist did this emdr-esque thing with me when I was having like, constant derealization and flashbacks multiple times a day for weeks where we'd talk about it and then when I'd get too deep and start not to be there she'd stop me and we'd talk about something that gives me comfort in really vivid detail. It was incredibly helpful and my flashbacks basically stopped after that, even though the stimulus that was causing them got worse. /v EMDR is so frigging strange. I did it and it worked but man, that was a weird experience. /v Hi Dodie, do you think you would be able to keep the text on the screen for a little longer if possible? I never have time to read it all!  love your videos and thank you for posting stuff like this. I don't suffer from any mental health disorders, but I always find it so interesting hearing about it from a first hand experience! /v I took Zoloft a few years ago and it made me way worse. I've tried a few other medications over the years that have really helped and made a huge difference, so I really hope you find a good fit for you! <3 /v I love you both ! Great video ! /v THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO /v It''s so wonderful to hear anyone talking about derealization on such a big platform, thank you so much. /v I just realized I must have something like this. Omg. /v wow that was useful. whenever i had dissociation, i would call it dreamscape because everything felt floaty and dreamy but in a bad way. /v I have derealization all the time as well and it is so comforting to know I'm not the only one thank you. /v YAY KATI!!!! I can't believe you two collabed!!! This made me so happy when I saw this video in my sub box /v Awwe I'm so proud of Dodie. She has learned to talk about mental health without over sharing. /v I have derealization and depersonalization and it's really hard but your videos help me. /v Really enjoyed watching this video. I don't have depersonalisation or anything but hearing kati talk about some of those things were so interesting and make me really want to study psychology. I went through and read to comments and so many people are saying they're struggling. I know this won't help or do anything but I'm so sorry you're having a hard time <3 I hope you get the help you need and I do believe that everything will turn out okay <3 xxx /v This comforted me I haven't recover since something that happened 2 years ago and to bring my brain back too!  \nI get headaches and anxiety too! And I fiddle so much and fidgeting since recovering from my trauma but I also might have ADHD too and still have derealisation too but I'm not diagonised but I know I have been going through depersonalisation for 2 years /v O n | m y | c h a n n e l | *K N I F E | F R E E !* \n(CSGO/DOTA/H1Z1) /v Stay safe and help each other out.

When Jesus comes back to take up his bride and punish the UNREPENTANT Sinners of this Earth. Those that trample the blood of Jesus under foot):\n\nFor the stars of heaven \nand the constellations thereof \nshall not give their light:\nthe sun shall be darkened \nin his going forth,\n\nand the moon shall not \ncause her light to shine.\nAnd I will punish the world for their evil, \nand the wicked for their iniquity;\n\nand I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,\nand will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\nI will make a man more precious than fine gold; \neven a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\n\nTherefore I will shake the heavens,\nand the earth shall remove out of her place,\nin the wrath of the LORD of hosts,\nand in the day of his fierce anger.\n\n(Isaiah 13:10-13).\n\n(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9)<---And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ).\n\n(Isaiah 66:15)<---For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.\n\n(Isaiah 29:6)<---Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.\n\n(Revelation 19:12)<---His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. (His name was JESUS!!!)......\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on the reason why people want to stay in their sins and not accept him as their Lord and savior and as believers, you have to produce works to show that you have saving faith in God. (Matthew 3:8)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.):\n\nAnd this is the condemnation,\nthat light is come into the world,\nand men loved darkness rather than light,\nbecause their deeds were evil.\n\n(Condemnation): Refers to the reason for judgment. The light referred to here is Jesus, the light of the world).\n\nFor every one that doeth evil \nhateth the light,\nneither cometh to the light, \nlest his deeds should be exposed.\n\n(People offer many excuses for not accepting Christ. Some cite the presence of hypocrites in the church. Others claim inability to believe some of the truths about Christ or the gospel. These are merely attempts to conceal a heart in rebellion against God. The ultimate reason people do not come to Christ is that they do not want to).\n\nBut he that doeth truth \ncometh to the light, \nthat his deeds may be made manifest, \nthat they are done in God.\n\n(The one who does the truth, (1 John 1:5)<---This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all), is obviously, already a believer because his or her deeds are done in God. Therefore, coming to the light is more than exercising faith. A person who comes to the light not only believes, but also openly identifies with the light so that his or her works can be seen as things done in union with God. (Jame 2:14)<---What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? (James 2:24)<---Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. (James 2:26)<---For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also).\n\n(John 3:19-21). /v Subscribe to my channel /v To be ready for God's arrival.

I love the foundation but will definitely be picking up a lighter shade! /v I love his nails /v lmao sister gerline what just link a dark skinned reviewer, there are literally tons /v You look a bit scary in your thumbnail. Not to be mean though! /v I don't see anything wrong with this review. It seems honest. People are trippin /v I want the primer and the foundation  /v You and Naz Kavari have the same hoodie ! /v Is way to dark sister you should use a lighter shade  /v It really nice of him to find the darkest girl in there and get her help to show the comparison on her skin. He did it to show the difference why is it all neagative. Just going to say thank you for the review James and will defiantly use some advice especially on the lighter shades because I realised they do deoxidise ! But thank you, can't wait for your next video x /v Idk why you wet the sponge when the foundation is water based and got upset with the results lol !!! /v i like that he talks fast, i cant stand when youtubers talk slow. /v I wanted to blend your forehead contour so much XD And kept staring at it the whole entire video XD /v is he on speed????? /v James you're so cute /v you did and said everything right dont worry i am black and i am not offended by anything you said /v Omg I was hoping you saw tati when you said you got up at 6.

I don't think the foundation was that dark, maybe only one or two shades. the contour, however, did you no justice at all. Overall good look though, I really want to try things from the line /v sister you slay!! like that highlight made you glow girl like GLOW!!! and that gold highlight would look good for like a party or with some yellow hoodie! also i have a highlight to recommend, like i have light but dark skin, I'm a nude shade so i use this highlight by Catrice cosmetics, the number 020 and it's called Champagne Campaign, so take a crack at that and you should do an all highlight video. /v James is just a girl in a boy's body.\n\nI don't date feminine guys but I would love to be his bff. /v Lol, it s a little bit darker than her skin tone? /v I wish he could talk more slow because It hard to understand english super fast /v I didn't catch any shade in this video at all, James was sunny as fuk, step aside you all blocking the lite, tripping on ur own shadows. Lol /v ummmmmmmmm why doesn't he have a car? /v I don't think that the problem was oxidization, from the beginning it was too orange/dark for your skin tone. I didn't interpret the video as you hating on the Fenty B. line. The cream contour you can tell did not work well for you /v Pls do a tutorial for that eye makeup!! /v please please pleaseee do a review on the Peaches and Cream line by Too Faced! /v Where are all the hate comments? I only see people saying quit hating James lol /v You are so flawless!! You are my inspiration sister  /v Woah did you see his neck where you could really see how it oxidized?! /v If you want to actually understand what he's saying watch on .75 speed /v Watch it in 0.75 speed, thank me later /v I don't know if this is a bad thing but whenever James wears these blue contacts he looks so much like Kris Jenner. I think it's just the heavy eye makeup, short dark hair, and then the blue eyes. /v Okay so was 17:26 - 17:33 supposed to be cut out  /v Girrrrrrllll!!! Breath and slow down!! Can't understand lmaoooo /v its way too unfair that he is hot without make up and with /v The gag is you need to use ALOT and it will make her more wealthy as you need to purchase a large amount . /v This boy better get away from my queens products smh complaining how he didn't get invited to the launch party hmmm I wonder why  /v all i can say is SMOOTH /v If I was Rihanna I wouldn't invite you too  /v This line is too luxurious for you white ass /v How hard did you screamed at a pillow after not being invited to the release party? Youre getting irrelevant /v Why the fuck is his forehead bright orange /v Everything about this brand makes me want to throw all my makeup away and replace it with Fenty. <3 /v He actually can't do makeup /v You are much more relatable without the contacts.... /v he is so a n n o y i n g omg /v yall gotta tell me im not the only one who thinks he looks like dua lipa? /v JAMES YOUR FOREHEAD IS ORANGE /v Dude speaks like he's on speed. /v Am I the only thinking he's stealing Ideas from other YouTubers are that somewhat big? Like Bunny and Manny?  /v I liked his video lol even though he was talking fast /v if you don't like his review or reviews then just don't watch it, james is james, his reviews are his, his colors he chooses are his, suck it /v What contact brand are you wearing? /v There is NO WAY you used 10-15 squirts of foundation... /v BITCH I THOUGHT YOU WAS QUITTING  /v His sister - FUCKING SHUT THE FCK\n UP /v Sis collect yourself! Priscilla Ono herself said that the foundation doesn't oxidize. U lookin like a Trump minion, u went way too far outchyo range /v 490 is such a rich, beautiful colour omg  /v Guys stop hating on him, what did he ever do to you? There are other ways to criticize someone without deliberately trying to hurt  them. ITS MAKEUP. just because the foundation didn't match doesn't mean it's the end of the world. /v OMG I didn't know that he had that many freckles on his face /v I watched a video that says james charles exposed nd dont watch if u love james charles aaaand this is why ppl hate james charles ik noone cares what i think about but after watching them i kimda hate u Not like HATE but dislike u /v rihanna dont deserve this /v You talk soo fast.

Her face is just plastic! /v She visiting kids who's lives she changing and people in the comments are worried about what she chose to wear...... tf /v jealous bitches if you don't have nothing nice too say zip it /v She got her lips done just because a guy made her insecure at a young age?! Before you can love someone else you have to learn to love yourself first!! A guy that truly likes or loves you wouldn't change a single thing about you. /v Wow /v King Kylie counting her coins while bitter broke whales leave comments about a life they wish they had /v Who wears nothing but a bra to visit a sick child?

One face at a time. God bless you Kylie for your kind heart. You are Genuine  /v Honestly, shes much prettier with her lip injections /v Her tv show is a big success  /v I would love to see Kris Jenner life!!!!! I die to see what doing this incredible women!!! A job,relationship,how she teaching girls the bussines!!!!!EVERYTHING!!! JUST WOW!!!! /v Good on her for paying for people's medical bills. /v She's nice. She helps people in need. That's good. She achieved something tho.. /v My classmate look like her...\ni am gonna propose her before anyone else !!! /v it's a good thing that she realized she can xhange others life with her money at a such young age no fucks given to what she's wearing doh she's amazing! /v Don't like her but appreciate that she's helping do some good for people. /v Life of my fake butt... /v Still a disgusting waste of a human being. That whole family is. No morals, all they want is fame and money. I tried on a dress, the moment I realized it was a kardashian dress I couldn't get it off fast enough! Haven't shopped at sears since. Refuse to support people and things that support them. /v is it true taking xanax can cause cleft lip my psychiatrist is a nut case hes telling me if i take xanax my baby will  end up with a cleft palettee /v i need to know what eyeshadow is that in 1:15 /v 0.58 viewer rating and reducing each week, its failing hard and due to be cancelled lol such a fake family and Kylie can't help but lie to her fans. /v i wanna watch but my family doesnt have cable :( no one in my family watches tv anymore! /v Omg I had a cleft lip when I was a baby then I I had an operation /v i'm awaiting for her to admit the rest of the things she's got done. Your'e not fooling anyone Kylie. /v Can someone land their private jet in the Keys next time there's a hurricane. Thanks /v she was covered up while inside don't you all see the jacket besides she is not the doctor and if it was not for the show you all would not know that she did it - haters /v what you've done shows that you have a pretty heart  /v She's not a hero. /v Didn't she start an anti bullying campaign #YouAreMoreThan before she got her lips done? Girl. Omg. You need a new PR manager. That story got holes. /v Eh... My first kiss sucked too. I was young, dumb and then we got into a huge argument 20 minutes later. XD\nNowadays, I just laugh about it. /v She is such a sweet girl. Even with all her fame and money she seems really humble. I applaud her for donating and changing those kids lives! /v I hope they all die /v this happened a long time ago /v It's so hard, like, being a teenager and running my business makeup lines and reality shows? It's not like you're working in a sweatshop. /v i normally don't pay attention to this family but i have cleft palate and lip so im very happy she did this. /v Wow she's doing something good /v she looks like michael jackson /v I love all of her outfits /v I can't really hate on her cause she's actually helping people and I'm not lol so i give her props. I still hate the Kardashians as a whole /v Kylie Jenner she wants to have Kids visit babies  /v this is pretty much the whole ep .... /v What is this place that she's going? /v Sweet /v Love you Kylie you're amazing  /v U know like like u know /v Kylie looks like my aunt /v These Kardashian bitches are why Bruce mangled himself /v Who's Kylie? /v https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59OxF3lEeya23KsLYncDxg?view_as=subscriber /v Nice /v second /v Is she gonna admit tothe rest of the enhancements? /v I honestly don't understand why celebrities donate  to foundations such as babies with lip disfigurements etc , yes it may be an issue but it's not something that is going to make them die instantly or effecting them to an extent that they are gonna die . They have food, water , shelters, abilities to an extent  . But children in parts of Africa don't even have the necessity s such as water and food and are dying every minute , they are infected with diseases that are life threatening .  But celebrities fund foundations such as animal shelters or disability shelters , when we all know other children in other developing countries in Africa have it worst . Donate to the suffering children of Syria , Iraq , Palestine . All the war torn countries that are invisible to mainstream media . Why praise kylie for filming herself giving charity?  Why boast how good of a person you are . /v 1:07 - 1:21 wow but that was so stupid. Balance being a teenager and run a business. Ppl go to clg and work double shifts to support them and their family. Wow. Srsly  wow. I pity her.\nBut at least she's giving back something. /v People are going to always judge and hate no matter what you do... /v First /v I commend her for donating to kids with cleft palates and helping make their lives better, but it feels counterproductive putting it on her show for views, which just earns her more money. Is it really a thoughtful gesture, or is it all just for money? /v For once I will say .. Bravo Kylie Bravo !! /v Kardashians....they try to look like Summer...but they ain't summer...I know those lips! Love ya babe! /v I don't want to live on this planet anymore /v she is killing the game, somehow she hasn't replied back to our podcast request though lol /v I only watch for the comments \n\n\n\nIs that bad? haha /v I knew that I was doomed. Lol. /v Amen  /v Very sweet of her  /v The stupidity of this offends me. /v Now we see why she got her lips done that's a bummer /v Kris Jenner is so fake person /v still people keep hatin on them coz they say these kardashians and jenners doing nothin. lol stfu this video speaks a lot mate /v This show is legit all abt her selfie /v now to take onpoverty, misery, hopelessness, pain, and sufferingworldwide! /v Morons give birth to more morons. /v Ridicula /v all for ratings!!!!!!!!!!!! /v Como assim as pessoas tao criticando a roupa dela inves de ver oq ela ta fzndo kk krl de internet pessoas do krl /v how can you launch app pair just got my device ? /v Kevin, how do you always have the latest phones? Do companies send them to you to review? Or do you have to buy them outright? /v So I got my Note 8 last week, and just last night, the notification bar, I cannot bring it down using my finger, I have to use the S pen, anyone having the same problem, or does anyone have a solution?? /v Beware to all Samsung  fucks over loyal customers  x note holder /v Swipe down notification bar gesture already built in to Samsung launcher /v Why does the s pen sound silly? It's a gotdam note...the whole point of the phone! /v Nice tips but imho the new Samsung UI has outdone Nova launcher. With the theme store, as you said you can have whatever look you want including icons which really is far better than what's on Nova, which really is just an additional skin on an already better skin and a waste of resources. /v Dual window is a great feature /v Dude...I just set up my Spotify/Maps app pair as well. Lol /v More like 8 things you don't care about. /v Love my unlocked note 8. No bloat, except Sammy apps but I use a lot of them. /v Really Awesome Kevin, really thinking about getting this phone. /v Note 8 comes with best ever design & features i have seen in note series but its highly over priced  /v Could you please share the nova launcher back up file? I really could use that set up on my S8! Thanks @TechNinjaSpeaks /v finally some dark themeagenice tips /v TO COMPARE PRODUCTS & PRICES ETC-http://www.qoo10.sg/gallery/Q108030459 /v The wallpaper please? /v http://tz.ucweb.com/9_1aCSt /v wallpapers from???? /v Good tips bro /v Another great video! /v Wallpapers? /v Awesome one /v 1: You didn't mention DEVELOPER options and reducing animation speed\n\n2: Why don't ya people HIDE THOSE DAM NAVIGATION BUTTONS!! /v First five things aren't enough, first 10 things are too much!! First eight things? That's perfect, oh wait I get it ! 8 things for the Note 8 OMFG /v Galaxy things note to 8 do /v Great video best tip is the disabling of the Bloatware Sprint has so many  /v Hey whats the wallpaper used on homescreen? Would like to have a copy.. thanks /v Something I hate from Samsung backup is that it doesn't keep passwords in apps LIKE IOS ICLOUD BACK UP DOES. Other than that is very handy. /v #NotificationSquad /v _The snack that fires back_ /v Ya, watching is soothing. /v Fun science right there /v are you guys ok? /v WOW! /v haha IRMAgerd... that's... that's funny. /v Amazing video! Subscribed! /v I realize you are a master of your craft but since this is YouTube and I have zero experience in candy making I am forced to critique you.\n I feel you could have taken your time in the design and more importantly the point where you join the colors together. They didn't make a swirl pattern which I would assume(since I know everything) shouldn't be that hard. /v I love the educational parts of your videos:) stay safe /v The respect I have for your anticipated power loss, and casual disregard is great.  It means you're thought your life through and have chosen it with care.    \n\nSome can't imagine how that works. /v This is my first video I've seen from you & it is calming to watch and I am falling asleep to it (not like its boring) /v I ordered some candy from them and it's really nice but it's cut so haphazardly and it's hard to even see the imagine sometimes because it's so badly cut. My only criticism /v I love your channel. I'm in fort Lauderdale and the storm left me without power or ac  Though  I am actually set on getting this candy /v I live in Palm Bay \nIrma wasn't that bad at all for us /v You have such a positive attitude, I really enjoy you and your content. I really think that people can learn a lot from your outlook on life. Never stop making videos, these are needed, these are inspiring, and these are beautiful. More people need to see this. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being so uplifting. /v What you said about people watching your videos and it helps them- it's true. Sometimes i watch them when i can't go to sleep- recently i got my wisdom teeth out and i binge watched your videos to distract myself from pain and boredom. /v I attempted to make hand-pulled cotton candy during days off from the storm, and now I know why it probably cooled too quickly! So glad I found this video; I'll definitely be trying again! /v If temperature isn't a good estimate of water content, what about the cold water drop test? I tend to make candies at home based on that instead. (kinda learned after a lack of candy thermometers and such). /v How did it go? I live here in Florida, still no power at my own house so I'm at someone else's, and I'm not sure if you were hit hard, so how is the shop, your home, etc.? /v I like to drink 'wuter' /v You have the voice of a Christmas movie narrator /v He is FAST at chopping those candies /v The question is...why is happening now? /v We are going to miss you /v That Title is gold! /v When he said birds are chirping I thought I was going to have a bad time /v The candy looks like it would cut your mouth /v Pretty cool video! Love the science you dropped on us! /v I like your passion that put it in to the candy :)) happy to watch your video\nAnd I can feel the sweet taste no matter I never taste it before\ncheerful hihi you create the arts which can eat /v The music sounded almost like the incredibles mixed with west side story /v What kind of candy is this? /v Don't suppose I'll be getting some of these gems in my order from a few weeks ago?  :-)  I'm in Tampa. /v When a hurricane coming near where you ;live moist people make plans of how to stay safe, this guy is making candy...... I like it! /v I love these videos, they are better than the oddly satisfying videos. Those videos you either dont see the finished product or you dont see the process. Your videos you see it all and your commentary is calming as well as informative! I have bipolar disorder, and on my bad days I watch your videos as well as soap making videos and it really helps me a lot. I think making a hurricane themed video is a great idea. Hope you all make it through the storm as undamaged as possible! We got some of Irma's rain all the way up here today (I live about an hour and half to two hours north of Indianapolis IN) She was a heck of a lady to be able to reach this far. /v Let's be honest, that hook is a little scary  /v This was SO relaxing.. was literally thinking that right as you began to speak about it /v well didnt know i was getting a sic lesson guess i enjoyed it /v Thanks to your videos it gave me the idea to make sugar cookies with pictures in them /v Background music is hurricane season lmao /v Were are u located.I live in Tallahassee /v Enjoying this video while waiting for electricity after Hurricane Irma...from Naples, Fl...one of those persons that loves watching your edible sweet art and I find it very relaxing. Takes my mind away from the current stresses! Thanks for sharing your talent! /v Well i finally watched it youtube! Meh! /v I want to work here and learn this. So bad. Like. Dream Job Level. (Also, holy crap, I've never really thought about that whole moisture and temperature thing and that would explain why my candy never works right at home) /v Is there ever an image where you need a flat side so you don't   roll the smaller rods while they cool? /v IM IN DENVER COLORADO /v Central Florida :)))) /v Its sticky when its humid right /v Anyone else hear double u double u double u /v 10/10 would buy /v Awesome. :) /v Breaking bad, anyone? /v Beautiful candy, skilled narration, and incredible cinematography. Amazing! /v Hope everyone's safe! /v Question, do you guys sell salted caramel candy? /v Hello Loft Pursuits, Im somehow really curious about that tool you use to the candy in the final pieces (not sure what its called in english). Is that actually that sharp or is it really just breaking the candy into pieces? I find it fascinating how fast you can cut the candy and have such consistently sized pieces. \n\nAnd by the way, I always watch your videos from work when I have to edit huge excel documents, its really relaxing! :)\n\nHope you stayed safe during the hurricane! /v Bob Ross of the candy world. /v How do you plan out the image inside the candy then make it flat and get it perfectly after rolling it!!?? /v Thank you for making this video.I have a big job interview in the morning and I'm so nervous. If you can stay so calm in the face of a hurricane I should be able to tough out a job interview. Thank you for the calming video and that little kick of inspiration so needed. Stay safe. /v I appreciate your choice of tunes: Hurricane Season... great pun Greg /v Before he cuts it I guess you could call it a hurriCANE \n\nIm sorry I'll leave now /v I'm not even that into candy but the way you did this and your narration was just amazing and very well done. Watching you make candy was really relaxing and enjoyable lol glad I found this channel /v Doesn't your arms get tired from all this candy making? My hands would! /v Hope everything is going Okay, I have a suggestion. You should try making a cat image in some of your candy it would be really cool if you could /v Your videos are very calming! I used them to help me get to sleep before Irma hit down here in West Palm :) /v I wish you did audio books =p your voice is nice /v That's so cute. /v I find your videos very relaxing and often work to them. obviously they're very interesting to. /v We got hit by the side of irma but broke a tree infront of our house /v I hope you and your shop are safe!! /v Cheers from Miami. Great video to watch after a long day/night of hurricane cleanup. Maybe one day I can stop by, but until then.... Fudge the gators. /v Lets hope it stops soon before it reaches more city's /v who can take the storm clouds mix it all with blue roll it right on up chop it into pieces. ok I was attempting a candy man spoof but I ran out of words I could use so that's what ya get sorry /v But what they don't tell you is that the food coloring is actually paint /v Lol, I notice u have hurricane season playing in the background /v Thanks so much for doing this video! I grew up in Florida and still have friends and family down there and my boyfriend's parents and grandma also. We've been concerned for their safety, but now that we know that everyone is okay, i can enjoy your relaxing voice and factoids and your beautiful art devoted to this massive storm. I hope everyone is doing well there. -Sarah, Indianapolis /v So relaxing lol... Hope all is well after the hurricane! /v my grandson lives in Alford  (just of i10 on 231 and I live in Panama City. We both love your channel and when he saw this one he couldn't wait to call me and tell me about it. I am still hoping to come to see you with all my grandkids and friends in Dec. I hope that you did well in the storm and no damage was done. some how you feel like family to us. Lovingly Lynne /v Hope your safe and sound after Irma, and yes your video is very calming or is it the Chardonnay?... anyway your video was enjoyable and I'm gonna look for more. Oh the thought of rose flavored candy is gross /v Rating: -12\nReason: too many puns in title. /v I had to watch this at a area with internet I wish I could have that but no internet no candy ): /v Hay candy man, you still there? /v I don't get hit\nBut I get LOTS of rain /v I just subscribed and I love these videos next time I come to Tallahassee I most definitely coming to visit you /v A grapefruit flavor would be nice! /v Hope you guys are safe!\nMuch love from Rhode Island. /v I dunno, hurricane Irma candy was probably in BAD TASTE. jk jk :^) /v Hope your safe love your channel  /v lol until now I didn't know that handcraft candy is a thing xD\nwith that said, I find it cool, and really, it is relaxing to watch :D /v Oh god,\nGod bless you all right now.\nPls be safe and stay safe\nGod watch over you all in florida.\n-amen /v Take a shot every time he says Tallahassee xD! /v Maybe have a few dehumidifiers in the shop for rainy days :) /v Im in florida too we got hit a couple days ago, there was no major damage, and very little flooding. But the power is still out and theres a constant sound if genorators running. At night we operate mostly by candle light. /v You from pcb lol /v From Australia  how are you? /v U should put citric acid to make some sour candy(idk if u make sour candy new here) /v Sounds like you need a climate controlled room to make this candy. /v How are you guys over there? /v Tallahassee took a direct impact /v can your fingers get caught in that roller machine? /v Well I've been doubting to order candy since I'm living in Belgium but finally decided to buy some. Bought 5 packs and it came down to a total of 71 usd, candy + shipping. I'm still a student so this wasn't all too easy to pay but it will hopefully be well worth it! /v The guy kite surfing during hurricane Irma had me dead lmfao /v I thought the guy at around 3:20 was green screened in... ohhh how the shadows tell otherwise xD /v Let me get my jacket on... /v Sign language is funny /v EVACULATION  /v Blacks are retarded /v 5:38 we're savages /v First /v 4:49 you can use , and . to skip between frames. He is in shorts and crocs I think, what the fuck? /v Homeboy at 2:46 thought he was Michael Jordan with that pose. He believed he could fly. He kind of flew but only backwards. /v The guy at 7:50ish was actually 100% correct with his angles, degrees, and directions xD /v Damn! That Ass at 5:58 /v That star exploring cassette was the best thing ever! I wish I could have that guy narrate my entire life.

Even though it's rather difficult to use, I found it rather interesting. I really liked mixing the iodine with water in the measuring tube and expecting a reaction. The premade slides were useful and fun to look at (when I could get the Microscope set up just right). I think the most important thing I learned was that diluted iodine and those shrimp did not taste good at all. I just think it's funny because I enjoyed it as a kid. In fact, I still have that kit in my closet... or what's left of it. /v Insted of throwind the stuff away give it to your viewers /v I want that olaf maker /v why is the girl repeating every sentence that the guy is saying? /v That exercise cushion thing, they have three light blue ones in my social studies classroom /v FYI Bad to the bone is copyright music /v Number 8 product its used in Physical Therapy, balance excercises /v i need like all of these items. thumbs up /v Wow that ice grinder brought back memories.

You're fucking retards!!!!!! /v Die Motherfuckers Die, you got what you deserve assholes..this is how God punishes evil motherfuckers......greetings from Mexico.... /v ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Florida that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2eQvIgZ /v But... what if you needed to open it on while stuck on an incline? /v and thats my boring video of the day\n\n#42 on trending, grats /v it's for when you accelerate....so shit doesn't shoot out the door. all that fwd Honda civic G force you get on the launch /v Thats actually a really cool little feature. If you had something with some weight in there, like a phone, a sock full of coins, or a lead pig. They'd probably overcome the spring-loaded door and slide out under heavy acceleration (especially up a hill).\nCheers for sharing your find, man. /v This is for when the car accelerates. Have you ever had something on your dash and started out real fast, everything gets dumped on the floor. This weight when the car accelerates quickly will cause the door to be held shut preventing everything inside from coming out. /v What an utterly pointless video. This deserved some recognition? /v It's for when you have something with a bit of weight to it stored in there (mobile phone, etc), so it wont come flying out on steep hills, accelerating, etc. /v Then you park on a hill and realise you cant get your smokes out... /v LMFAO... and when you stick your cigarettes and wallet in that box then park on a hill...LOL  yes this did happen. 1995 Rodeo.  I removed the door FOREVER... /v K WE GOT IT IN 20 SC. NO NEED TO GO ON. /v That was actually brilliant. /v Hey genius, it's to prevent stuff from flying out when you ACCELERATE.\n\nYou really think they would put a locking mechanism for when the car is tilted backwards?? /v Jesus H. Christ in heaven above fuck me in the ass. Why are there so many negative comments about shaking and dropping? I didn't have a single problem with the video and thought it was very interesting. Shut the fuck up! /v 700 people cannot hide their drugs in there anymore. /v It's probably a part of the safety features for accidents. Whatever is in the compartment during a crash would overcome the spring loaded door and become a lethal projectile. The weight would lock the door during an impact. Just a guess /v Can't fit your hand in there because it is made to hold CD cases, not 'stuff'.  Don't you hate when the quarter you just really need is sitting back there and you can't get it out? [Insert dropping and smashing sounds here...] /v i wish they would have done somthing like this mirrior under the sun visor. the dam lid would fall down. eventually got pissed amd ripped it off ass a cop was parked next to me. /v Just think of the engineer, or team there of, that is soaking up a free paycheck to overthink simple problems. Why simply use a stronger spring that holds the door closed when you can spend hours making a stupid fail safe for a junk compartment! /v There's a similar feature on tripods that will hook your camera from falling off... It also prevents shakes and rattling. /v and if you park uphill you can't  access whats inside?! /v I Jared,\nMy name is Johanna and I work for a video production company called StoYo Media. We would like to publish video in a story. Of course we would mention you as owner of the content and make your name visible in the video. \nMany thanks\nJohanna /v this would have been a good video except your camera work. Please put your phone on a tripod next time you want to make a boring video of the day.\nShaky video is worse than Portrait video /v Here's to engineers /v You're a nerd. /v the guy holding a camera acts like retard, so annoying /v So if the cars upside down....it shuts the box? /v I'll bet it's super annoying to have it lock up in San Francisco. /v When going up a hill, that locks the door and stops anything that may slide inside from sliding out and flying across the car. So in essence, that is a time saver, because it saves you the time you'd have taken to clean that mess up. /v If you are getting towed the guy can't steal your spare credit cards and cash etc.... /v People in San Fran be like duh. /v Could you stop hitting the thing on the table. I don't know if it's on purpose but man is it annoying. /v Ok this is cool but what's the code for my fuckin radio?  It just decided I need a code so now no music. /v STOP moving the camera around so much, you idiot fuckstick. /v Are you really this stupid? /v 552k views. Not even 200 subscribers. What /v It's on the Suburu Baja as well....actually, it's probably on all Suburus /v For when dat vtech kick in yo \n\nDon't want homie dawgs weed flyin bout da car when u takes off real fast out da KFC drive tru in the civic u n yo boys just stolt from da white mans down da street. /v One of the many tiny things the engineers came up with that was kept in the design! /v Shit, now I gotta go to my car. /v How many times can he drop it shake and drop it again, I thought he was showing a video on how durable it was. /v It's the little things in life  /v OMG stop slamming SH!T on the table! /v You should notice a small, useful device called a tripod. /v When your laptop is worth more than your car /v It so when you have heavy stuff in it and you floor it, the thing doesn't dump all your crap out. Not for hills. It's a honda, not a Jeep genius. /v When your boring video of the get becomes trending /v Wow, worst camera work ever. I've know squirrels with near fatal meth addictions that had a steadier hand with the camera. This was impossible to watch after about 7 seconds in. /v That's so rice /v That must be a feature to stop a-holes from fumbling through all their crap while driving. It probably locks when the car hits a certain speed too not just uphill. /v It doesn't keep the door from opening on its own. It keeps YOU from opening the door. Certainly not a feature I'd like to discover when I really need to get into the cubby. /v Japanese engineering. The best in the world /v Alternate title is ape manhandles car part. /v Jared, Roger here saying hello! Aka Klasse Act aka The Striped SVT. John S sent me your vid here, hope all is going well with you....subscribed! /v Wow genius, how about we take a look at the rest of the car where there's 100 things that are much more impressive. /v Its to keep it from flying open in a rearend collision. Good try though. /v This guy hit the jackpot. Only had 120 subs, is on trending and gets 466k views /v Maybe has something to do with the door opening slowly and smoothly? :/ /v I'd find that really frustrating if I lived on a hill and that damn lock kept making getting my stuff out after I parked difficult to get out. /v Who else is watching this after reading the Mashable tweet ? /v So fucking what? If it was constantly flying open everytime you drove uphill, it would be a major design flaw. Is this a video to amaze retards or something? /v Lmao he's not a professional YouTuber!  Y'all watching Casey neistat and expecting everyone to give a shit about video quality! He's just a nice man who was trying to share something cool! Keep bein groovy Jared! /v be me, own POS 2003 CIVIC hand-me-down. Always have to park on uphill slope when I get home from minimum wage job....can't open goddamn storage unit if I'm not level, so needless to say I often have to leave valuables behind until the next day to retrieve.   One day I leave my prized anime cards behind after forgetting to open latch during a level straight away.  Park near studio apartment.  Storage unit is rendered useless.   Cards are in the car overnight.   That night there is a BLM protest on my block.  Car gets set ablaze.  Cards are gone forever.   \nGet on youtubes to find solace, comfort and maybe some seductively soothing ASMR.....instead find a fidgety dork honoring the Honda engineers for this this blatant quality control oversight.   \nDecide to take pills and wait for the sweet release of death.  This will be my final post.   RIP in peace, me. /v Everyone in the comment section needs to chill. He's holding a large, clunky object with his non dominant hand so he can hold the camera. So what if he's a little clumsy. /v pick it up and throw it around five hhundred more times /v but what if you park on a hill and need to get something out of there? /v It's there to lock the door in case of a rear end collision. /v cool..ya coulda made this video about a minute and a half shorter tho just sayin /v I am not sure I understand correctly:\nIt sounds like you cannot open it when you are parked at a hill? /v my honda crv has this as well. couldnt really figure a use for it when i had my dash apart a saw it so i just taped it so it wouldnt lock. never thought of hills though! /v Check put my channel for some cool car videos :) /v Wow mind blown wow I'm going to put one on my dick now so it always hangs straight /v another neat feature of Hondas is garbage airbags they subcontracted - they replaced my airbags three times TWICE FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE. i drove a car with a faulty safety system for a freaking decade. done w Honda /v What if you park up hill and you want to get your shit out of there but you cant cuz it locked it self? Does now seem very ingenious now lol /v Some engineer at Honda must be really happy rn /v A man is washing his car with his son. The son asks...\n\nDad, can't you just use a sponge? /v mmm, neat. /v JALOPNIK is here :D http://jalopnik.com/this-one-little-engineering-detail-is-a-great-reminder-1803758960 /v 666 dislikes /v Wow dumb asf /v Idk if im amazed or bored?? /v What amazingness.

You just want people to see how smart you are, like a typical redditor. /v So for everyone who had one of these and could never figure out why they wouldn't open up while accelerating or driving uphill. Let's all do a 1 minute silence in their memories. /v You are shit at filming man. /v Its not for hills,but  mostly parkings i think. /v you should click clack drop and bang that thing around a few more times in your next video /v One hand recording makes me rage....uggghhh /v got confused by instructions of operation. DiCK gets stuck on box when going uphill. /v Really?  /v 0:32 deduce, not deduct /v How is this trending /v this vid makes me angry for some reason .. /v I get the feeling this guy has killed someone and I do not know why seems shady /v I'm a parker supporter but I think pulev doesn't have any any chance against Joshua don't think he poses any threats apart from a jab he gona have to fight on the outside while running backwards in circles lol /v It's what boxing needs to hear although everyone knows the odds are heavily stacked against Pulev and what's allot more likely is that we'll see a 6 round blow out. /v IFL dick thinks he's a street fighter. lol /v LOGIC of boxer . If i was right call me MESSIAH  otherwise i was just  little wrong . How dumb it is?  IQ 0 ...!!!! /v Imagine meeting this guy if you accidentally trod in his foot in a bar. You'd be ordering a pint of Immodium. /v Seems like a top man, would have a few laughs on a night out a bet. should be a really good fight /v anthony will kick his ass, wait and see /v ha ha so u will, klitschko put you on floor six times and k0 in 5th round, poor chin, n lack of boxing craft n ring,this be over inside 4 rounds, joshua wins easily /v he didnt say i will knock AJ out he said he belive he will win and he wasnt sure if it will come by knockout or by points, anyway i really hope he will knock out AJ because i really hate that guy. /v Everyone says that and we all know how they have got on /v isnt this dude one of Mayweathers body guards? this fight is a disgrace to Boxing PERIOD!!!  Anthony will KO HIM quick /v Who the FOOK is that guy? /v AJ will win this AJs fist is twice the size plus he's built his body for the job to be champ for many years to come /v I have 4 seats for sale for Anthony Joshua vs Kubrat Pulev in block L28 (the seats right next to 'VIP' block L29) if you would like to purchase then please contact me at: piff2228@hotmail.co.uk\n\nThanks /v You couldn't knock out a wank in a brothel fat boy /v Will be one round fight. /v I think this dood can beat jo /v U doing Notting stop talking shit trash talk  ur ass getting knocked out in the first  round good luck keeping talk trash /v Oooh i hope our boy Pulev gets home well and alive /v You'll do Fuck all JOSHUA IS BEAST /v Can't wait for this fight. Pulev is a cool dude too /v He's good but he won't be able to handle aj's power. I think it's going to be a good fight tho, I think AJ wins in 7-8 /v Mark my words the fight wont go for more than 6 rounds and Pulev  will be flat on his back out cold staring at the ceiling !!! He is no contender for today's HW's he doesn't have the prerequistes end of story. /v I would love him to ko AJ  /v Joshua will ko this guy /v nice one kugs , you can tell him in bugarian that hes a mug after AJ kos him /v Seriously? Payday? Do some research... he has 1 los... against the great wlad. Respect the guy and do your research... this is no molina.... he has names such as chisora under his belt /v COBRA IS NUMBER 1 /v  ! /v proper really  looks like pretty brilliant'through   ! /v Pulev is really under rated, judged because he got beat by Wladimir Klitschko the way he did, Wlad fought real aggressive that night and would of caught Pulev off guard. this will be a good fight but Joshua has that crazy ass power. /v Get your ass ready to get knocked out!! /v 6th round ko ole pulev getting knocked the fuck out /v Kubrat, go home mate you've had one too many drinks /v This guy is decent but i think AJ beats him Allah Hu Akbar!!! /v            . /v I despise Eddie Hearn and his bullshit matchroom promotions, it is matter of time before AJ is exposed. AJ went the distance basically against an old Wlad, a prime heavyweight would finish AJ. I will put it out there, a prime David Haye would KO Anthony Joshua. Heck even Tyson Fury would KO Anthony Joshua. /v AJ will bang this guy out any body who think this dude will beat Aj is a fool /v You couldn't get a completely shot Chisora out of there but you're gonna knock AJ out, sure thing Kubrat, cool. /v Better bring more oomph than Wlad!! this fight might be better /v Regardless of his celebrity status among the boxing world this guy looks like no joke, looks like this is going to be a sick fight! /v yet again a good name opponent for joshua but joshua will carve him up in 4 rounds......easily. /v ask how he will feel after the fight, also germany is not a language german is. /v Go Cobra! /v Best of luck Pulev! /v If he still fights with that weird stance like he did against Klitschko, AJ will knock him down in less than 5 rounds. I was so confused when I watched thaz fight. He has absolutely no chance lol.\n\nTo be fair though, he can take some heavy punches, so 3 knockdowns minimum should be recquired to finish him. /v   ...      , BG ...  ... /v fucking dickhead /v AJ knocks him out... /v Yeah course you will mate looool. /v You aint gonna do shit /v   /v Seems a lovely guy /v  ! ubrat will win /v Pulev top man /v KOBRA ti si pobeditel predi da si pobeditel . Gordem se sas teb I te potkrepia ciala Bulgaria. Mach Ihm fertig Pulev!!! /v Pulev win /v what you knocking Out Joshua ????? hahahhahahhahahhahahhaahhahahhahaha /v   ?     . /v heheh there are like 20 guys with him in his Bulgarian crew. I think what he's trying to say is that Eastern Macedonia is Bulgarian LOL. /v He better come with some Wilder windmills and pray one connects or he is done inside 4! /v lets face it, at 4:45, Kugs could have been asking Pulev if he wanted to knock one out or if he had a lovely pair of beefy breasts, he would have still replied the same reply. He didn't have the foggiest. /v ok so Klitscho knocker Pulev ass out and AJ in turn put Klitscho to sleep. And yet he gonna knock out AJ..ya right..go figure.. /v black horse of the fight and very underrated skillfully fighter. /v Aj going to finish him /v Seems like a nice enough bloke, not going to be easy to knock him out though, easy nights work for Joshua I think he'll show a different side to his game and show he's listened, he'll be patient sit behind the jab not do anything stupid, take him into deep water and turn up the heat, Joshua's fitness will tell and he'll get the TKO I reckon. /v Kubart pulev A.J. Will smash you in maximum 4 round you are to soft for him /v AJ has a beautiful left hook he can't take Joshua power /v Good to see a bit of banter /v When ifl tv learns how to focus the camera I might subscribe... /v Klitschko already beat this guy and AJ already beat Klitschko. AJ vs Pulev is pointless. These journey men fights piss me off. AJ cashing in on hand picked fights until he really has to do a real title defence fight. /v I'd have asked him if I could have a go in his mrs lovely bangers /v  /v Kugan is class /v Top forma! /v Pulev is alright...Who knew /v Lets be honest,Kugan is a proper geeza!\n\nAlso Pulev seems like a real decent guy!\n\nEnjoyed that a lot /v JOSHUAS 2ND BEST opponent TO DATE BOUT TIME THE GAME GETS HARDER !!!!!! /v i like your new intro ,but leave out the old staff. /v Joshua's hardest fight without doubt ... \nthis guy ain't no joke ... \ntop 5 heavyweight ... /v Pulev and his translator...look like dangerous, tough guy eastern european mafia.... I say you lose, then lose...otherwise you lose house.. Get them into Hollywood when the boxing comes to an end. I hope he performs well, he was brave against a Klitschko on fire (who would have stopped Joshua) and he looked like he had more to offer in that fight but didn't get to show his stuff much. But I feel Joshua wants to go out and make an early aggressive statement...but might be a mistake, as he might gas again and then get clobbered by round 6. /v This guy looks hard as fuck /v Comes across as a really genuine cool fighter - respect! /v Joshua evading Haye and Ortiz watch an AJ interview and watch everytime he is asked about Haye he gets all worked up and dismisses it changes subject yes bellew you beat him but we all know he had 1 leg and bellew still couldnt knock him out Haye better than Pulev that's for sure /v I  juicing up with PED's  feeling strong and super human. Klitzchko retired did not want to face me. He big chicken. Pluck Pluck Pluck. I blow JA ah AJ he a Pluck, Pluck Pluck. Fanz in Inglan love me a big lot. /v Kubrat Pulev can't punch hard. If he had decent Knock Out Power he could be a Top 3 Heavyweight. I mean the guy weighs 250 pounds. There's no reason to be a Powder Puff Puncher. /v Kugan did a good job here! Pulevs a decent bloke /v Nice guy, pointless match up. Kell brook mandatorys /v I like him. /v Joshua in 5  /v 7:12 Kugan! Leave the boxer alone! /v AJ is fighting an insignificant fighter /v when i want !!!!   hahahahahahah /v Kugan is a cocky piece of shit. Joshua asslicker, Klitschko hater, but still poor. /v        ,          ()       . /v Wladmir ko him and AJ will retire him, thats all that matters. /v I'd like Pulev to win of course, but I don't think that he has a chance. /v           ,          20         /v This man doesn't like getting hit in the body seen most of his fights can't take a good body shot! I'm sure Rob MCCracken already knows this and will be working on it with Aj.... /v WHAT BEAUTY THING SHOULD I LEARN HOW TO DO NEXT?  (I am literally clueless at everything beauty related! I have never even bought my own makeup lmao) /v You are so beautiful Michelle  /v Aye 17 magazine was my shittt. I regret throwing them out now. I had so many issues /v Michelle, I love your channel, you have been such an inspiration!  /v I have long, super straight hair. I  can put it up in a pony, wear it down, or down with a head band. That's it. Hahaha /v Girl I always thought you were beautiful.  But wow.... keep it up girl. /v Anyway you're face is ugly! /v Ren is so sweet! and he was such a nice teacher! great job to both of you! /v If Michelle thinks that was voluminous....... idk what she'd think of MY definition of volume. /v sped it up to 1.5 and she sounded like a normal person and not the uhnmmmm slow talker she usually is /v You and safiya should try different hairstyles on each other as a challenge /v *starts video*\nMe: I can't wait!\nVideo: *not even a minute in and gets ear raped*\n\nMe: *falls outta bed* FAJEBDBJDHDJEJRBEBEB /v I was hoping she would go into the buzzfeed offices and show her co-workers but I forgot she doesn't work there anymore. /v It's Poppi!!!!

Every video of yours is so interesting and empowering! You have such a lovable personality, and it's like you're taking us on a journey with you. /v I love it! So flowy! /v You are unbelievably beautiful and it's not like you need makeup, but you need to feel your own version of beauty!! Regardless, you are absolutely stunning. no matter what you do..you are one of the most beautiful human beings I've ever seen. You're perfect and you're so unbelievably beautiful!!, /v Foh u look the same.... cream pie material /v Finally learned how to use the curling iron now thanks to his tricks yay /v It's better if you don't show the after in the thumbnail. That just ruins the surprise. Why am I going to watch the video when I can already see how it turned out? /v I would totally get you pregnant /v that scream just blew my ears out.... ouch /v You're not a celebrity /v I love you i think /v Maybe for your next diet adventure possibly go lactose free for a week /v Love this series idea do makeup next! /v Try nail polish. Or try waterproof makeup at the gym! Try one of those with Jordan! /v Look at you on trending !! /v I dont see the difference /v Still looking ugly. Maybe you should shave your head, then you might get some attention. /v Is it just me or was Michelle especially giggly today? /v OMG this is the video I have been searching for my whole LIFE !! I have always wanted celebrity hair !  I'm just like you, I never know what to do with my hair and just put it in a low pony tail /v Damn, that ponytail was a hot mess /v i'm gonna use that pony tail trick when my hair grows out! thats so cool. /v What did he put in her hair to make it so shiny? /v Fuck this misleading title and fuck this girl. She is so irritating. All of her thumnails have the same oh im scared but not face. And fuck whoever put this on the trending page. Im glad the ad appoloclyspe happened so people like her will make less and hopefully leave youtube. I hide her videos every fucking time i see them and they keep popping up. Fuck michelle khare. You have a boys body and a personailty as dry as saltines. You are a plain ass bitch that is basic enough to give buzzfeed a hard on. /v Why is this on trending with only 2k views /v Simplynailogical should teach you how to do your nails  /v My heart honestly skipped a beat on the reveal of that last one, holy shit /v You are still not a celebrity /v This video was great!  really informative! (: love you girl /v she's so pretty! <3 /v I loved this video. /v I have been trying those beach curls forever /v Who else knew Rene from Lilly's vlogs :D /v You look better than a celeb girl /v A lot of people has that hairstyle... /v MIchelle: I don't know anything about beauty and fashion and colors...it's not my thing.\nEvery guy in the audience: Marry me. /v you're so beautiful Babe /v You are a beautiful woman /v Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms /v You've inspired me to try (for like maybe a day before I give up) with my hair /v I like before you did not need a make over /v I CANT BELIEVE YOUR WITH RENE!! He is Lilly Singh's hair stylist!! Whaddupp Papi!!!  /v Lol your just blessed enough to be beautiful, you could wear a potato sac and still turn heads! /v Your so pretty I didn't even notice you changed your hair. /v Women be crazy.  You go out take the bitch home and wake up to what the cunt really looks like. It would almost be like discovering the girl was a dude. Dishonest fake disgusting. Watch out for any chick that wears a lot of makeup, guarantee she is a phony in other ways as well.  If you date a girl ,when you go to her place checkout her makeup collection if there is a lot of it run... /v Am I the only person with eyes that can see that there wasn't any difference.... /v You were gorgeous before the makeover. \n\nI'd be proud to be with a girl as gorgeous as you are. Stop worry about what others think of you! You're gorgeous girl! /v hey guys! i post different kinds of lifestyle videos and beauty, so i'd love it if you checked my channel out !!! new videos are coming soon and they will be a lot better i promise !! /v *DO NOT PUT GLOSS/SILICONE ON YOUR HAIR.*\n\nThey are lying to you it is extremely damaging & it strips your hair of its natural protection. Your f****** up your hair. /v Id give her the dick /v She looks like Nataile's outlets lol  who agrees /v U look the same.... /v There's actually a restaurant called MK XD ( why did I say that I sounded mean... ) /v I know this is off topic but your dress is gorgeous! /v I can't do my hair, not good with clothing either... I can partially do my makeup lol /v you are so beautiful. before and after. /v went to seven to 4, nice. /v looks the same to me... /v I love that you didn't just get someone to do it for you as I always have the same issue as you its fine when the hairdresser does it but then you leave with no idea how to do it yourself! Love this video <3 /v But you look the same before and after...  /v Hi renee know you from iisuperwomanii -lilly singh /v I knw him from superwoman yey /v Your hair looks amazing naturally just saying! Haha /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CloPa99g3-o /v why? /v hmu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n984-sesame-street /v ...uh, hmm, OK... /v Your so beautiful /v Congrats on trending /v Woah! She's trending /v Is that Mia khalifa ?! /v https://www.getclicksonline.com/ /v https://www.instagram.com/sixwomen6flavors/ /v what a cutie /v https://youtu.be/_r7XoeZ_HSc /v PAPIIIII /v mis matched socks! /v Hola papiiiii #teamsuper /v Still look like an ugly whore.. /v Looks the same /v Nothings different /v michelle looks so freaking beautiful!!! /v AWESOMER HAIR !!! /v I LOVE RENE!!! /v I suspect this dude was drafted - Hey - does anybody in the office do sign language? Ahh, I used to do a bit in high school... Fine you're drafted... Just giving the guy the benefit of doubt. /v Thank you!! As an ASL instructor, I will be sharing this version with my classes so they can truly understand how awful this was. /v Florida, putting the potato into emergency... /v That's some George Costanza level shit right there. /v I don't know ASL, being Australian,  but I bet he's doing as good a job as YouTube's captions. /v Impersonating an interpreter during a state of emergency should get him some jail time. Hearing people would not put up with someone that mumbled through all that emergency info. Dude, you are a jerk! /v He should've just held up a sign that said RUN /v This is no bueno, especially due to the circumstances. Thank goodness closed captioning for the hearing impaired is a necessary for all stations. /v To be fair, this guy IS better than Obama's interpreter at Nelson Mandela's memorial. /v Oh my, this is terrible! I hope the Deaf people do get to know what they were actually trying to say! /v Thank you for doing this!  This situation is absolutely appalling. /v Can I comment on that whacked out lady talking here?  She's packing the kitties first and then the kids can come if their able?  She carries a stress pig and told everyone not to worry because she found a lucky penny?  Is this lady in charge of anything important? /v No. Just no. How? Who? Where did the find this interpreter? Tell me this is a joke made in really really poor taste.  /v This man is not a fake You guys are all hating on a man who puts his heart, sweat, and blood into this county, he was only helping because no one else could. maybe you shouldn't take shots at someone if you don't know them or the full story. /v Wow this is disgusting. I can't believe I didn't hear about this through any mainstream media outlet. It's not ok to risk Deaf people's life just because you think you have a working knowledge of ASL. How can someone who (supposedly) has a deaf family member be so utterly ignorant of how much he is risking the safety of the local Deaf community with his nonsense signing? /v It's amazing how he spells words wrong by sign language too /v I understand the gravity of this situation, but I could not help but laugh. The subtitles vs the actual content was so wildly off I couldn't believe it. /v Dude!!! I've been studying ASL on and off since I was 7...that being said I KNOW I can't do more than vocab words! (English grammar I got, ASL grammar is tricky to put into practice for me) Have some respect, if you know you can't keep up with the person speaking, one of his many problems, don't do it!! If you find fingerspelling tricky, another of his issues, don't do it! Finally, if you are not an actual interpreter or in any way fluent in ASK, his biggest issue...DONT DO IT!! Lives hang in the balance for something like this. /v This is unbelievable! How on earth did this happen?  Even if this guy was asked to interpret as a last resort he should have declined, knowing he doesn't know ASL! What made him think he could possibly wing It? Shame on everyone involved who allowed  this to happen, this is people's lives we are talking about. I can't imagine what it would be like to be a deaf person who needed to hear this information sitting at home with your children trying to understand what this moron is saying, I would have been so furious. I hope there are consequences for this moron. Unbelievable!!!! /v Thank you for captioning what the interpreter is signing to raise awareness of what was really interpreted for those unfamiliar with ASL. Devastating mistake to not have a certified interpreter at such a crucial time. Generates more problems/panic than simply relying on CC. /v He is not an interpreter.... he is a lifeguard who brother is deaf. Poor guy....caught up in the wrong situation /v This is so sad. /v What I read in a news story (accuracy is unknown to me) is that he was pushed into doing this and never claimed to be a translator for the deaf, just has a deaf brother. \nThis has happened in the past and it was stated gov. translators would be screened and certified (or whatever) in the future. \nIf they were in a bind, they should have written up cards with the info on it for the deaf to read. Misinformation is usually worse than no information. /v He should be a congressman, they fake it everyday! /v lucky penny and stress pig?\n\nfuck my state /v My first job in high school was interpreting ASL with no certification for minor things in my neighborhood - also not paid at a real interpreters level, of course. Coming from Saint Augustine with FSDB, it's a more deaf-friendly city. I would imagine it's rarer to find signing hearing people in other areas. \n\nIt should be obvious that he was uncomfortable, so I instantly felt he must have been asked to interpret because of a lack of a certified interpreter under the circumstances. I have found myself in non-televised interpreting situations before that were too big for my britches. I would have been mortified if they were recorded. Please give him a break - he did his best, & it's a tough, high pressure situation to be in, especially on the spot. Let's not overlook the fact that he's serving in other ways, too, which is more than most can say at the moment. Give people a break - we all could use them sometimes.\n\n It may not have been ideal, but really people, a hurricane just went through our state. We've got bigger problems at the moment, & fortunately closed captions. Fortunately this was not a true *emergency* message (as far as I could tell), even though I know it must be isolating to the hard of hearing to be excluded from any message/update. So instead of spending our time pointing fingers, why don't we all just learn some sign language instead? /v Oh my goodness ... this is horrible . /v First off, it is unfortunate that the local FEMA representatives responsible for emergency operations AND the local municipal government failed to have a qualified resource available to interpret, it seems to me that the problem is more of educating THEM on the importance of having qualified interpreting resources.  People sometimes think that when someone says:  Oh, I know sign language they are qualified to interpret (maybe all they know is finger spelling!  I give them credit for at least attempting to have someone there versus not having anyone at all.  This is of NO FAULT of Marshall's and he clearly did not state he was an interpreter in the first place.  Too many things happening in too short of a time for a critical natural disaster such as hurricane Harvey and hurricane Irma do not always allow organizations sufficient time to plan these things at the last minute -- that's why they should have agreements in place and interpreters included in ALL Emergency Management plans.  Don't trash the person who at least attempted to help, trash the people who don't understand they could have caused more damage than good by not having a qualified interpreter available. /v Hi Jane! I am a reporter for ABC News and would like to speak with you about this video. Can you please message me when you have a chance?\nThank you. /v J.   i liked that. /v People getting offended but maybe they just did not have someone like they should have so they had John who did sign language in high school 2 decades ago to do it. /v This is like those dreams I have where I'm in a band playing a concert but don't know how to play the instrument /v He constantly looks at the speakers as if he needs to lip read too. /v Stuff like this is why 9/11 happened and every official in the US was like whoopsie daisy \_()_/ /v '''''interpreter''''' doing his thing with one hand....they are mocking us, it's so right in our faces....wake up people! /v It's like some unfortunate SNL sketch.  OMG how did this happen?? /v they should've gotten Lydia Callis fro NYS who did all of the Hurricane Sandy briefings. /v I shared this with my little circle....sorry to rant, excuse me, people fluent in sign language are better at spelling than a non ASL....am i correct??? i am just stunned!!! /v How does something like this even HAPPEN? /v I assume this unqualified interpreter knows we can all see his unqualified know-nothing ass. /v want flood? nice.. /v Wow. .. /v bear monster wants his pizza. /v And 1 thanks :D /v Who low settle want flood?  Nice. /v i knew it!!! /v WTF??!! That's not ASL!!! /v We get signal! /v This guy's fucked. /v https://youtu.be/QReUbe4kp-o /v This is terrible! /v WTF! /v OMG!! i can't get over it!!! I suspected thank you for confirming!!! OUCH! my heads gonna explode!!!! UGH!!! THIS IS EVIL! /v Anyone know jive? /v HE'S TRYING HIS BEST. IT'S AN EMERGENCY. DOGCAT! TOYS FUR! STOP BEING SUCH JUDGEMENTAL ARSEHOLES. PP NEED LEFT! /v Maybe it's a different sign language language. /v No, he wasn't trying. You can tell he wasn't trying. Stop making excuses for someone who just couldn't do the job. No one could make him do anything. This is just awful. /v Make sure you take your Pets with you first and don't forget your kids.\n\nF*ck you Yanks are dumb, how many Muffin heads does it take to report on a Hurricane?!? /v remember when that guy faked it during Obama's speech? he was an interpreter for like 20 years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn81s7BhunM /v 2:15 she has her lucky stress piggy and found a penny heads up, so all will be ok.  < \nlady not the interpreter.  The interpreter actually made more sense. /v Well she talked at the speed of light, give the guy a break. /v 2:23 Who Mexican /v It's likely all the actual interpreters already evacuated and this guy along with other officials and rescuers were the only ones left. It's a shame he was thrown under the bus like this because he probably isn't trained as an interpreter and forced to do this. /v Please stop the hate speech.  You are all seeing a Lifeguard with a Deaf brother attempting to interpet.  This is an example of why interpeter training is required. /v You can tell by the way he was dressed, etc, he was probably pulled from the crowd. Goes to show the ignorance of many local agencies and untrained masses. Unacceptable!!!  /v I am hard hearing and deaf too that Ican't believe it this interpreter is suck! He not really ASL and why someone want him interpreter for on news?to tell people warning not clear.His signing is AWFUL. I am shock. /v It was him or nothing. He was roped into it because he knows a tiny bit of ASL. Give him a break. /v Is anyone else tired of these nanny state pressers. And how incompetent do you have to be to have to grab a faux deaf interpreter that knows very little sign language. Unfortunately this has been happening a lot lately. These are govt officials? This would rarely ever happen in the private sector. Someone should be fired over this. /v ITS ALL FAKE PEOPLE, FALSE FLAG ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS AS HELL /v 'ay, umm. anyone know asl?'\n'kinda'\n'YOU'RE HIRED!'\n\njust dont say you know it\ni know more than him and im 13, not deaf and dont know anybody deaf.\n god /v so what does the video actually say?...... /v This is absolutely hilarious. /v To all the people trying to defend this man by saying it is not his fault that he's completely butchered ASL during this crucial time, OF COURSE IT IS. In no way should this guy have raised his hand if the county asked hey does anyone know sign language?. And if they were still pressuring him to partake, then fucking run away! This is so horrible. Very disappointing and shameful for all those involved. /v i could have done a better job and i'm ASL illiterate!!!! SORRY FOR SO MANY COMMENTS BUT I'M OFFENDED!!!! my heart drops into my stomach :-( /v if your deaf, and you rely on a random tv dude to inform you that a hurricane is\ncoming, then you've got bigger issues. this guy was not qualified for the task. obviously. but he volunteered to do it so as to not go totally without. so relax and stop taking about jail time. /v If I was standing by where he stands, I would beat the shit out of him. This is unacceptable for fake interpreter. /v Hi Jane, I'm a British journalist and think this is a great story that highlights a problem many people don't know exists -- would you mind my making a copy of the video / captions to share ? Could you send me a message at ericmunn01@gmail.com? Thanks in advance! /v my dad is deaf glad he isn't in Florida /v I Know that it's appalling if this is his best attempt at interpreting, but we need to also think that this might not be ASL, it could be international sign language, Spanish sign language, french, etc. I'm not saying that it is, but just think about the fact that it could be something different than ASL before we start condemning him. /v I always wondered what a deaf person with Tourette's Syndrome would be like. /v Gee, at least he can get SOME of the actual words right. I always wondered how accurate sign language was.  Spoken language is difficult enough for the human mind to grasp; how meaning can be conveyed with these crude signals as rapidly as speech is tough to believe. BTW, in Japanese signing, WHITE people were referred to by using an open OK type gesture around the eye, signifying round eyes.

Sorry tmi. /v Best part about watching these singaporean food videos is that I get the craving, and I can just go out and get the food. Thank Mikey for sharing Singapore's food to the world. We are really passionate about our food and love it when we see others enjoying it too :) /v When I see a green cross, I think of medical marijuana. /v Got to try the Laksa at 92 jalan senang Singapore 418464.

The way you describe the food, the aroma, the texture, the fragrance, and the flavour. You get it! You most definitely get it! I mean... I've seen videos from big names come down here to taste our food, like Anthony Bourdain and Gordan Ramsay. They showcased our food and sang them praises, but you... you just GET IT!\n\nI only wish I had followed you on your other social media, I didn't realise you came down here! Also, you really managed to cover almost all the bases! From Bak Kut Teh to Briyani to Chicken rice. You definitely did all the homework, and were rewarded with some of the best dishes we have to offer the world!\n\nLove from Singapore! /v The names and prices disappeared too fast! /v please eat your rice with a spoon /v hi, are you still in singapore? /v I think Mike would like good food then good pussy /v The food court at the airport was BOMB!!!!

I am quite sure the spicy Indian cuisine is tailor-made for you /v Fat makes the world go round along with the belly that grows with it /v Irma-gerd, I came back to Florida after the hurricane passed and I didn't have a hot meal since and when I watched the this, I literally was tortured with plates and plates full of delicious food. /v Proud to be singaporean /v Don't stick ur chopsticks vertically up, in Chinese believe, it is to invite ghosts to eat your food /v Why would you people want to watch this guy shove food\nIn his mouth your all robot followers. /v Bedok Blk 85 market (another hawker centre) is also really good! You HAVE to try the minced pork noodles, definitely THE best in Singapore. Although it's a huge debate as to which of the 3 there is the champion... /v I could smell the food, soo yummy!! /v Thought it was Jackie Chan /v Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how robot augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23 /v I didn't know you had a food channel!!! Always watched your main channel. Glad I found you again so I could subscribe again /v Check out this Victoria's Secret Garden Limited Edition Midnight Mimosa Silkening Body Splash 8.4 fl oz (250 ml) on BriskSale! https://brisksale.com/refer/59b7d705812c02582d2f3a94 /v When looking at the subtitle, everytime he say crab, it shows crap. It doesnt get any crappier than that /v Goes to old airport and doesnt eat roast paradise. living life wrongly. /v I live in Singapore i hope to see you /v As an Asian, I always cringe everytime Mike tries to scoop rice with a fork... /v use a spoon its more asian lol /v When he poured the curry in .

It was as delicious watching as it ever was, maybe i need to plan a trip to Singapore just to eat right again. /v @strictly dumpling, when's the next Singapore video gonna be up dude:) /v Oh, I can't even begin to communicate my jealousy of the foods you have eaten.  I'm in landlocked D/FW where no seafood prospers.  Thank you for sharing your enjoyment; I happily live vicariously through you.  Cheers, brother. /v Hahaha... Mike, that bowl of fishball soup is just pure MSG and a bit of anchovies. The secret to the Hokkien Fried Noodles is the pork bone stock they use while frying it. The stock is absorbed into every strand of noodle and vermicelli to give it that intense flavour. I am a Singaporean by the way. /v Idk if I have the stomach for this **proceeds to devour crab** /v I didn't know you had another channel. Made me think it was Jackie Chan in the thumbnail /v Eating using just a fork /v STOP IT y=u making me want to go there to try it but that would be a waist of money cause that the only reason i would want to go uhhhhhhhh! /v its like final fantasy female character..sweet and perfect.. nice.. /v You talking with your hands makes me dizzy lol but I love all your videos.  /v What is fish tofu? /v Amazing food. I also love how you can just go there and see where the lines are and you just know that it's good. That's the kind of food culture I just don't see here in the Netherlands. A stall's best advertisement, is the length of its line. There's just no lines over here. /v I love fish balls! They are so tiny though. /v Ohhhh myyyyy those crabs YUMMI YUMMI /v Only clicked because I thought it was mr chow  /v DAMN IT! Now I'm hungry and it's 12:00am /v poor singaporean.... they gonna extinct soon..... woooohoooooooo.... /v FoodPorn /v 11:13 salute....that's me /v https://youtu.be/OcMvXKjp9jw /v I LIVE THERE /v Do u envy singaporeans? /v Lol I survived hurricane irma /v Lmaoo never heard somone discribing breaking the law so beautifully @4:27 /v #50 On trending!

That was the best part in the song, so much imotion in your voice!

My dreams stars are Venus Solane Serena and Sharpovia /v One of the realists already, just watch her interview. /v If you look at how Sloane play, she always stays calm under pressure, during all her matches, if she remains that way but learn to hit like Serena she would be unstoppable. /v she is gorg! Chocolate with dimples...congrads girl /v #blackexcellence  /v God bless! Finally a woman tennis champion that isn't on gorilla monkey face steroids. And she's beautiful too /v I only  watch black people play sports.  they're faster and stronger then anyone on earth.  ..... period /v 48 thumbs down on this lol.

I'm happy for her. /v so proud of her! /v Her private life is her own. /v how does drug testing work at the us open and how often do players get caught /v Wish I can hug them /v http://blackmeninamerica.com/tennis-there-is-a-new-sheriff-in-town-sloane-stephens/ Sports in America where it is never as simple as Black and White! /v Way to go, Sloane!!!!

Another tennis queen. /v LOL she always has that trademark surprised look like i did it? to the box. i remember she had the same one when she beat serena too /v Would've been funnier if the title read stole the title\n\n\nCome at me snowflakes /v Incoming comments from racist whites who can't handle black women dominating traditionally white sports like Tennis. Sloane will join Serena and Venus as legends /v When I saw two Americans, I wondered if I misread the video title. I guess the American women--besides Serena--are faring better than the men. Congratulations! /v See that? Thats genuine athleticism and great sportsmanship. Great job to Sloane /v I'm really upset and pissed off why in the heck can't we have this kick in the pants sport,  tennis in San Francisco's AT&T park.

Those things are expensive  If you are willing to help out at https://www.gofundme.com/8k360andwaterproofcase\nEven $1 will help! Thanks for the support! Will be creating more content at sea! /v Now that's what I call TimeLapse!!! Watch it on a big screen or a projector and you'll drive all the stress out of your mind! /v Nice timelapse! During watching i was curious which route the ship used, maybe you can add to the corner of a screen a little rotating planet with a tiny red dot. then we could see where you were situated on the planet. /v Wow that was way better than i thought it would be. Thanks for sharing. /v Thanks for offering me a journey that, apparently, I will never make. /v Really great video. Would be great to see a little map insert every now and then to get some context of where/what we are looking at. Great work though! /v Honestly, the best timelapse video I've ever seen until now. The best timelapse at sea! My dream has added this new thing. I Thank You.. /v Truly amazing. This video is incredible. /v Yes yes really amazing ur video.\nI love ur videos and very nice /v The sky at after. So fantastic /v Very nice! I learned a lot from this. Thank you. /v brilliant. and this is just one planet. /v Jeff - Great work! I really enjoyed watching it. /v Incredible journey and views or the skies /v Amazing and beautiful. Great choice of music too. One of the best videos that Ive watched in a long time! Great work!!! /v This is the most captivating video I've watched on YouTube - Amazing ! /v Amazing!!! \nCan you share the shutter speed and interval? /v This has got to be the transport video of the year! Outstanding talent and effort! Thanks Jeff! /v I LOVED it... totally loved it this is the most wonderful thing that I've seen in so many days...a world from a different angle which is not possible for everyone to see...thanks a bunch for making this time lapse video these 10 mins were wonderful 10 mins of my life  those stars the sea the clouds the weather...it was all very beautiful  will sure like subscribe n share it...thanks again /v Sound track is so powerful!! It goes completely with the clips, hats off to your effort :) /v This video was really nice. Along with the narrative of what going on around the ship. /v What do you mean, if you enjoyed the video? How could anyone not enjoy it? It's the most amazing thing I've seen on YouTube. Hell, it's probably the coolest video I've ever seen. Thank you and please continue to share these videos with the world. /v I got emotional not going to lie /v This is an awesome video!!!! /v I just had to comment. This is great and had me spellbound. Greeting from Singapore! /v I was in the U.S. Navy for 30 years and really relate.  Fantastic!! /v wow. I envy the view you get of all those stars at night. Just incredible! /v such a stunning and amazing videos, thanks for sharing bruh. /v amazing. make more of this. /v Jeff\nWhat an amazing vid. Keep up the great footage. /v That was pretty cool. With the time lapse and amazing views, some of which were very beautiful. Kind makes you stop and think. We have a beautiful planet, and we should do more to take care of it. - Also, by the time I finished it, it kind of made me want to sail around the world lol What an adventure! /v nice video!! very well achieved!!\nthanks!! /v Man that's beautiful out there on the ocean, what's it take to get into a line of work like this? Even like a low tier job on a big cargo boat? /v What great color variety and vibrance ! /v Outstanding!! The Beauty of the sky is unparalleled!!  Do you enhance the images in any way? /v so amazing , beautiful and marvelous . thanks for bringing this lovely video for us /v There's absolutely no way that you can see the stars that well if so I will lose my God damn mind I probably wouldn't know what to do I'll probably faint /v Excellent video as usual jeff! /v its hard to maintain image exposure during 24/30.. you did a great job. this is one of the best video on youtube /v Absolutely amazing.  No offense to the original music but I watched the video synced up with Maggot Brain by Funkadelic and it was almost Stendahl amazing. /v This is amazing! I'm a fan of time lapses, but this is one of those special ones because of the distance covered and all the types of weather that was captured. /v Having served aboard two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, I can relate to this. Nice work, Jeff! /v Great video, so relaxing to watch! I appreciate the information you provide during the video,but could you do one without additional text at the bottom? \nWould see this playing as a loop on a screen!  /v best time lapse I've ever seen. so inspiring, God created this earth for us to experience heaven, but the system sucks that life right of you and forces you to struggle for a living.. /v Let me know in the comments below what you think of this type of video. \n\nI LOVE IT!! /v it's a nice relaxing video :) /v Thank you for taking the time to shoot and post this. So awesome. I could watch over and over!!! /v this video makes me want to become a sailor /v This is amazing. Id suggest breaking up the clips into shorter versions. I.e - Sri Lanka to HK 10-day time-lapse. Nice work  /v well done, absolute day to night mastery, and never have I seen a container ship more romanticized /v So worth it. Thank you. /v This is mindblowing...I really enjoyed this, thanks! /v 1) is this at all a dangerous job?\n\n2) how long are you at sea when you are assigned? Like a rough range of days?\n\n3) what do you do when you're not on duty?\n\n4)this was an amazing video!! Thank you for sharing it with the world /v Fantastic video. Would love to see more. /v Simply beautiful. I was so mesmerized. Love it. Keep it up. /v I thought this was exquisite.\n\nthank you /v That was 10 minutes well spent. Beautiful video. /v Not 4K on my Samsung Galaxy S8+ ... just 1080x60 /v This is beautiful, it's amazing how you capture the greatness of the sea surface on travel, i enjoyed it with my two year old son. /v That's cool.... At least you found something to do during your down time, change cards, download and create.... That's alright !! I know you have down time to rest, eat, extra duties like buying supplies, and of course time lapse editing and typing.... ha ha..... Good job and thanks for the fantastic voyage ............ Take care and stay safe ........ /v Honestly, the best video I've ever seen.. like by far /v After the first 30 seconds I realised I'm so busy reading the tiny subtitles at the bottom that I'm missing everything else going on. Sorry dude, your subtitles will have to wait until the 2nd viewing. /v WOW WOW WOW!!!! That was so AMAZING!!!! Thank you so much for sharing. What an amazing job you have. Enjoy your holiday :) /v Can you do one underneath the boat? /v Jeff. 2 comments - i make videos a lot and these 2 suggestions would have made this video SO much better. Its a great time lapse  - totally compelling and the music is great. Comment 1: Don't use a full color watermark. If you're gonna use a water mark - white only, 50% opacity in the lower right hand corner. DON'T use the youtube logo unless you work for youtube. Comment 2: your commentary is distracting. My guess is you could get away with not using a lot for example don't comment on obvious things like the weather, we can see the weather, its obvious there are thunderstorms or rain or deck lighting. PLEASE no emoticons, icons, flags, colored text. Keep it simple.  Great work! But remember - the more you add, the less professional the video looks.  cheers. /v This is the video that's going to bring your channel to the next level.- keep it up.  P.S.been following you for a while now...  SUNY Maritme /v I can't remember when last time I saw something this beautiful ! Made me speechless. You should love your job that you are so close to the nature. And we, live in concrete jungle, eat plastic and watch screens. I watched this 3 times in a row. Nature is great. This is god. /v Please Please Please get more of these videos they are so interesting. /v This was unlike any video I've seen before. Thank you so much for making and uploading it! \nIn awe seeing the Milky Way, as well as the sea/ocean trips between cities /v Tears from a wannabe sailor at the beauty you shared. \nDid you really not have that much weather. I would like to see the weather more. And were the seas so calm or is it just that you ship is so immune to changes in waves? /v this is no doubt the most incredible beautiful video that I have ever seen in my life. Thank you for producing this video. You have captured so much Beauty that others do not get to see period is so dark at sea at night that you can see all the stars and even some of the Suns of the other galaxies. I love how they have placed all of the containers when the ship in a certain order, so that at each Port they know just where to take the containers off. again, thank you. Really cool video. /v This is the most beautiful video I have seen in a very long time! Such a great idea, concept and realisation. And some of the colours are simply stunning!  Please shoot more of this videos! \n\nGreetings from germany! /v Great video, amazing sky, not easy work creat from all photos this timelaps! But my opinion but kamera inside the cabin not have weather trouble! So u can film during bad weather conditons also  /v Looks like a space travel /v I dont think Ive ever said unbelievable out loud more times than I have while  watching this. Its incredibly beautiful! What a great piece of art youve shared with us! /v Wow dude, I wasn't expecting to be so captivated. Brought tears to my eyes... no more words can describe it. /v Amazing!!!wonderful, no words fot a video which I loved!!! /v very cool keep it up interesting /v Jeff, have watched most of your videos. You tell a great story. I subscribed right away. Keep it up! /v this is one of the most spectacular and beautiful videos i've ever seen. great choice of music too. great job. /v FUCK the FISHHEADS who TRASH USA /v Love this video!! /v Nice /v maallah /v Amazing! /v amazing! /v AMAZING /v watch this while stoned OMG /v Amazing! /v Awesome!! /v Sooo beautiful!!! Nice work!!! /v Absolutely stunning! /v New subs here, cool video! /v Beautifull work /v This is beautiful /v Wow! just wow! /v very nice /v Awesome video thanks! /v Beautiful video. Thank uou /v 6:20 is amazing /v What am I scared off most? Clowns that commit suicide man that freaks me out. /v gonna get a lot of flack for this but IT for me would probably look like white michael jackson. nothing against him, i love his music but he's scared me since I was a kid /v Does failure count...what is the embodiment of failure...me 45 years from now having failed and completely given up. /v I think it wouldnt turn into anything for me he would drop me in the ocean untill im scared shitless then he eats me as a sea creature or something but can he do that idk /v My understanding of IT taking the form of Pennywise, at least based on the Tim Curry adaptation, was because typically Clowns were enjoyed. So IT would use the clown to get close and entice people to let their guard down. Which is kind of what happened in the first film adaptation where the little girl hears Pennywise laugh and she even smiles. It's not that people feared clowns so much as it was easier to set them up before knocking them down as a clown rather than say... the creature from the Black Lagoon. /v Fat kid Snow White that Bitch in the sewer, he still doesn't get the fucking girl, I'm just like wtf this kid has the deepest bond with the girl,  none of the bonds were that deep but the fat kid had the deepest /v I didn't think the kiss was too cheesy since I saw it coming. In Bev's room, there are a few fairytale storybooks laying around. I think it was supposed foreshadow that she longed for a happy ending. It also shows how her father controlled and tried to see her as a his little girl ... /v Either a xenomorph from alien, or the creeper from jeepers creepers. /v Beverly's dad - he was telling Beverly you are my ____? What is the blank?? /v The answer is cocaine man the answer is cocaine /v A giant spider. Just like the end of the miniseries. Freaked me the fuck out. Clown. Spider. Yep. I was, like, 10 I first some bits of that movie. Haha. /v I can't wait for the sequel in which of bunch of kids are afraid of their iPhones breaking. That is the epitome of fear if that happened to a kid today. /v I think a punch from Jeremy Jahns would scare me the most...\nThat guy got some serious practice. /v Of course Demonic Hauntings are real...the Fan4stic movie /v Hope they get seth green in the second one /v I, too, subscribe to the fear makes them taste better theory thus far. /v It would probably turn into commitment somehow /v Movie was fine, not as good as I think everyone was making it out to be. I was expecting something on the level of The Conjuring but got something on the level of Mama, the director's previous film.\n\nThe biggest problem was too many underdeveloped characters. You could take Mike, Stanley, and Ritchie out of the film and it would have changed absolutely nothing to the story. Also the added conflict with Henry at the end literally went nowhere and added nothing to the plot.\n\nThey should've spent more time developing the characters and showing us how their fear relates to their characters, such as Bill being afraid that Georgie is dead, rather than having a spooky scene with Pennywise every five minutes so the audience doesn't get bored!! Stanley being chased by a painting or Ben chased by a headless person could have been taken out to actually give us more about their characters so we feel for them when Pennywise does attack them. \n\n7.5/10. /v welcome to the loser club motherfucker! /v If pennywise wanted to scare me he'd looked like like the people from Strangers holding a knife :( /v It would turn into me. /v they should make the new it when the actors are 27 years older /v You should make a podcast of you just talking about movies /v After the scene in the garage I heard someone in the theater start crying, it was hilarious /v IT wouldn't even know what to turn into. I am afraid of so many things, he would be so flustered like how bout i just go through a bunch of them and you tell me when to stop and we will go with that. /v I want Tj Miller to be grown up Richie /v 6/10\n\nopening scene was awesome\nrichie was on top gun 5/5\npennywise was 2/5 creep factor 5/5 cool mlg cool factor.\nas a book reader, ill give it 3,2/5 /v For me, IT would turn into high school. Yeesh... /v The scariest thing for me is a clown. I saw that movie cause my friends begged me and I made them pay for me cause no way in hell was i going to waste money to torture myself. If I say that clown in real life best believe I'm running to Alaska and never coming back /v I literally want an IT in my life just to see what scares me the most because I have nooo idea /v 'IT' would turn into something that is incomprehensible and horrific with inhuman movements. cause for some reason that shit freaks me the fuck out. So, Lady Gaga? /v Mike Tyson in his prime... tell\nMe you wouldn't be scared shitless if mike Tyson in his prime tried to kill you /v You Jeremy IT would turn into you /v It would turn into commitment for me /v If you know what it is, don't tell me, don't ruin it for me. Did you really just say this in a spoiler video? About a brand new movie? You are posting spoilers for a brand new movie. But don't want anyone spoiling a 30 year old book for you. My mind is boogled...or boggled....or booboggled..... IT is an alien by the way...don't look into the light.... /v I've said this before, but here goes: If a movie takes its source material from another movie or TV show, it would be considered a remake. If a movie takes its source material from a book, it would be considered an adaptation. I hope this sorts out any confusion for people who think IT is a remake of the mini series from 1990. Quite a few people also didn't realise that IT (1990) was a mini series and not a movie. /v My fear is either spiders or the girl from the ring /v Also why did the painting lady look just like mom from Mam /v Not sure, really...I'd say a shark would probably be a good option for IT. /v It would be cool if chaper 2 was released 27 years later with the same cast. /v No lie, It would become the Xenomorph if it wanted to eat me /v Jeremy, When you finish the book, I want a book to movie review. And my fear is a spoiler for the book... /v Also... it would turn into freshly bloomed lotus pods.. id be so busy throwing up and crying that he'd be able to capture me /v I thought it was gonna be more gruesome cause that first scene kinda set that expectation so when saw no other deaths like that occurred I was like Oh, well...alright then... /v IT comes back as Micheal Jackson... RIP to me /v Pinhead  from hellraiser, that will be my worst nigthmare. /v Thats a nice line up for a gangbang :3 /v Once you finish the book, can you do a Spoiler Review of It?:) /v Joseph Gordon Lovett would be interesting it see /v This movie was way too cheesy for me, not scary at all, and the cgi was terrible, and I've already seen this plot done 1000 times, I think it's over rated /v This movie did a good job frightening me up until the scene with Beverly's father after that I spent the rest of the movie wanting to kill him myself /v To answer your question honestly, as a kid it would have been a swarm of wasps or yellow jackets. When I was 8 I went outside to play one day while my brother and another kid from the neighborhood threw rocks at a hive of yellow jackets. The yellow jackets attacked them and when they ran across the street in my direction I was stung several times. Didn't know it at the time but I was allergic to bee stings, this caused me to swell up bad and be admitted to the hospital. Up until the time I was in high school I had a huge fear of bees and the thought of being stung again. I outgrew it and faced my fear but during the age those kids were it would have been that. /v The kiss actually was more like the book. Fighting IT is just like the horror. It scares you with what you're scared of... and It can be fought with things you believe would work... so the belief of waking the girl with a kiss is certainly a thing like the kid would believe and so it worked. This was a MAJOR theme they did a TERRIBLE job of presenting in the film. /v The creature from the black lagoon does not kill a bully he kills an abused kid but other than that you are right about him being the creature the whole time. I can't wait till you see what IT really is !!!!!! Sorry the book nerd in me just came out :-D /v i dont think that the reason Pennywise did not killed Beverly was because she was not scared, i think that it had to do with the fact that he realized that she is not longer a kid, because right before he was going to killed her he smelled something, it It was supposed to only eat kids at this point, or at least that is what i felt like for me /v I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!. I literally HATE horror movies. But oh my godddd I was SO creeped out by this movie! I was grabbing my boyfriend's arm the whole time and squeezing it,when usually in a horror movie I'm like YAAWWWNNNN. \n\n\nI give this a 9.8 out of 10. /v the reason beverly woke up from the kiss was because she was afraid on unconsented sexual relations from her father which was the only thing she feared more than pennywise, however when ben kissed her she wasn't afraid because it was out of actual love compared to her father and it kind of broke the 'tripping balls' state she was in. /v Better than the Original /v Glad to hear you're reading the book, when you finish it can you do a video on it. Thatd be dope /v I swear when they do the sequel to It I can totally see Amy Adams playing the grown up version of the red headed girl in this movie /v The pharmacy scene where Beverly says the man looks like Clark Kent & he says she's lois lane and everyone in the cinema just cringed and went ew /v If you add a bit of film grain to your backgrounds it would get rid of the banding, or some slight noise ~ probably make your videos look cleaner /v I would totally love to see you review the book. Have fun with the ending for part 1. /v Pretty sure this movie gave me PTSD on top of my PTSD\nFucking awesome movie though /v I heard it wasn't that good. I heard the IT character really wasn't that scary. Not only that, it gives no explanation as to why this creature has to come out and feed every 27 years.  Any of the other decent horror movies atleast has a reason why they do what they do. Freddie was killed in a furnace, Krampus exists to teach bad children a lesson. What is IT's reason? And if he's a spider again, that's going to be soooo fucking lame! :P /v it would turn into taxes or an empty bank account  /v The kid from stranger things was amazing in this /v Georgie was afraid of the dark... Not clowns. That's what IT killed him /v I don't know if my expectations were way too high after seeing all the praise this movie got but man I was so disappointed after seeing this movie. Like it was just so painfully average and cliched throughout the whole movie. Like nothing even happens in it. They see Pennywise, he runs at the camera, next scene. Then they go down the well, hit it with sticks for like 10 minutes and that's it. I dunno man maybe I'm missing something but for me personally, this movie is getting way too much praise. Like not a bad film by any means, just very average. /v From what I know, IT took the form of Pennywise to lure children and to eat them, hence his behavior towards Georgie.\n\nIt's possible also that IT just loved the form of Pennywise, considering everyone by some degree don't like clowns. /v IT would have to turn into me... /v @jeremyjahns what did you think of goergies death scene? I personally was so creeped out. could barely look /v Jeremy, would you consider doing a review of the IT novel when you've finished reading it? /v Is it capable of turning into the ocean? Or extreme heights? \n\nI mean, there's also wasps and stuff, but that's not really fear-for-my-life kind of stuff. /v It's funny you say Amy Adams, I kept thinking that girl looks a lot like her the whole movie /v And I'm pretty sure It would turn into my closest people hurt by me, or something else I'd rather not share with random people. /v This movie was a comedy /v omg i immediately thought of pennywise as a boggart too!! /v I honestly hope they don't get a bunch of stars for the sequel and they just find the right actors /v No no no, Amy Adams better not be in the sequel. She ruined Louis Lane but she better not ruin Beverley. /v Nothing, I don't get that scared. /v I enjoyed this take on the movie but it was a Comedy.\nI didn't find this penny wise as terrifying as Tim Currys.\nAnd I didn't understand why his head kept getting bigger I some scenes.\nThe George scenes was good and I didn't think they would go there.\nAnd l believe the George and bill truly loved each other the as for the friends.\nIt was bull, no friend that are bought together by bullies would act like that towards each other.\nAlso spinning the camera or shaking the camera doesn't make this the most terrifying movie you will see this year.\nWell I hope not or the horror genre is done.\nI rate this comedy 7/10. /v Mike was supposed to be the historian but they gave his important role to the fat kid. I preferred the book because he was one of the few black characters in fiction given development, racism in the 80s was addressed, and he wasn't stereotypical, but in this movie they tokenized him. /v Was that the creature in rudolf the red nosed reindeer? The bumble? I saw that as a kid and it seriously freaked me out. It scared me. The stop motion added to the creep factor. For me it was something that stuck in my head for years afterwards. Now at 49 its still creepy and yeah I wouldn't want to see it in a dark alley. /v A whale, it would turn into a whale and i'll die isntantly /v YES! A boggart is immediately what I thought of when they started incorporating their individual fears. I can't help but wonder if JK Rowling read this at some point and that's how the idea of a boggart formed. /v Pennywise's friendliness is basically like a shield. It only works once, before your cover's blown. /v the worst thing that IT could be is to shape shift into is Chris stuckman wearing a jeremy Jahns disguise trying to give a movie review on as good as jeremy jahns but failing horribly! lololol /v If It bleeds... we can kill It. /v It would turn into fant4stic dvd if its gonna hunt me. /v It would turn into an accountant telling me to fill my time sheets for the week /v My mom's sandal /v *crosses fingers*\nI'm terrified of Alexander Skarsgard. /v READ THE BOOK /v batman wouldnt have been afraid /v Necromorph from Dead Space. /v a big ass tarantula /v vigo the carpathian from GH 2, yep, That motherfucker was Creepy. /v Loved the movie /v Turns into john cena /v When I die. I want to come back as a killer whale. /v Hey we should put those killer whales in tanks and swim with them! /v This is why you don't get in the water with killer whales.  They aren't your friend. /v I know the history of the name Killer Whale but I think we should name them by their scientific name; Orca. Orcas are beautiful creatures and mean no harm to humans. I know as I have dived with them on many occasions in New Zealand, Norway and the UK. The name Killed Whale strikes fear and makes people think of them as destructive murderers when really they're benevolent and only hunt specifically. /v One of the best footages of 2017 /v Christ Almighty, they're not whales, they're orca or giants of the dolphin genre. /v and the PG BBC strikes again /v It's really annoying that the killer whales seemingly never fail. I'd like to see something get away for once lol /v That's what Trump wants to do to the Mexicans, Black's, Jewish, Women, Muslims, and non-racist Americans /v The feminist killers be wantin' the same size dorsal fin as the males. /v Don't worry Guys, the killer whales are only doing scientific research /v Seagulls and sea birds should be referred to as sea vultures /v This video edit sucks!\n\n Were are the Ariel shots??? /v I'm more concerned on how cold the water is /v where were the mikne crew? /v If I was the minke I was stop and go for the male 1v1 me broooooo /v Evil exists in nature, who creatures nature is god, so god is evil /v Humans are the only predator who roots for the underdog.  All other predators kill and eat the underdog.  Just so you know, we got empathy along with religion, music, a few other things about 80,000 years ago.  Without it, uncle jon with the broken leg wouldn't be helped-who in turn helped back when the leg healed. /v Very good footage, especialy for me, that loves Cetaceans. They are just M A J E S T I C .I cant even have a favorite species.. \nAll cetaceans are cool on their own way: \n\nOrcas are Huge predators but wont prey on humans for some reason.\nBowheads can live up to 200 years and they live on cold polar waters.\nBlue Whales are the biggest animal that ever lived and its vocalization is deafening.\nSperm whales can dive very deep to search for food, sleep verticaly and use sonar to see when there is no light.\nHumpbacks jump over the water, dance with its mate and have the most beautiful vocalization, almost like singing.\nThe List Goes On...\n\nCetaceans are something special. /v Where are Paul Watson and the Sea Shepard when you need them? /v Why dont they bite it to death instead of racing for 2 hours? /v This commentator can give life to a standing still vase on kitchen table !!  /v Why doesn't the Minke whale dive deep? /v You know what they say, the bigger the dorsal fin.. /v What a happy ending! /v i dont blame them. having lived with innuits and eaten minke.....\nits like beef of the ocean. so tender though...\n\nseriously its like red meat but as soft as fish.... innuits eat the fat too... that just tastes like fishy greasy fat.\n\nbut the meat? 10/10. im with the killers on this 1 /v Who saw those sea creatures at 2:01 /v Way cool /v 4:36 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, Minke!!!!!!!! -_-. /v I wish Japanese ate killerwhales  /v It's the circleeee of LIIIIIIIFE /v The fact you hear that final blow crash like that the power is amazing /v Why don't rorqual whales dive to escape predation by orcas? /v Nature is a real f.  The Minke gave it a run. /v HUMANS R SO EVIL!!1!!!!1!!11 /v For me Sir David Attenborough  /v I really like your videos, but would be nice if they would have subtitles, English subtitles I mean. Thank you. /v Forget Shark Week... there needs to be a Killer Whale week!!!! /v Killer Whale is a perversion of Whale Killer /v Orcas have big jaws with large teeth yet they don't initiate their attack with bites, i guess that's because they don't have claws to grab their prey or pin them down like big cats.  Water is just air, and ocean mammals are quite slippery too, or maybe orcas are gentlemen and ladies, they don't want to dine like thugs like hyenas lol. /v The wolfs of the sea /v Oh Minke, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Minke! /v tear...for the minki /v thats a bad way to go. RIP Minke /v MashAllah /v 4:12 that rainbow tho /v Nice video  /v Lol those two penguins/seals at 2:00 /v Absolutely beautiful... /v  /v ohh poor Minkie  /v #EarthGoHard /v It's amazing. Killer Whales are truly the apex predators of the sea, because they have no natural predators (not including humans). They are so intelligent, and are even more intelligent than our own dogs and even some apes. \n\nSad that we have to imprison them in asylums for our entertainment. /v The way orcas hunt is scary but  it's an incredible footage. Circle of life. /v Finally Type A Orca get some recognition /v Where is the under water cam when you need one /v Does your minky have a license? /v Orcas literally operate in gangs and jump other whales. Break yo self! /v 2:06 - 2:12 When everybody goes to the gorge on Karelia in War Thunder Ground Forces /v well, you know what they say about whales with big fins... /v Could you see a Rainbow 4:13 ? \nOn the left side /v Beautiful. I love when animals act like animals. Now if we can just get people to be more human; that's would be worth a 5min video. /v I  Attenborough's narration. Whatever he does, its natural. I think he did for pocoyo, didn't he? /v This is how nature balance its self /v Strange, the killers never intended to eat the minke. /v baby minke + easy to kill - orcas like us are lazy :) -- adults too much work /v But whale hunting is illegal!  Someone should arrest these orcas and turn them into vegans. /v I reall hope there will be 4k content in this channel. /v David Attenborough his voice is so profound /v No justice in nature. /v They weren't this scary at the SeaWorld...crazy /v Green Peace shall protest against this cruelty. Down with the killer whales and sea gulls! /v Why did the BBC not intervene? Humans should provide food for all wildlife to prevent this from happening /v People have no empathy for animals. They're all caught up in their narrative. /v I love orcas so much! /v These prey animals have no sense of pride. I would have biten the fin or tail off one of the orcas. At least you take some out before you go. /v Hungry Beasts  but no matter what I would still love nature  /v Incredible footage! You guys are amazing. /v 2:01 penguins! /v 3:36 Aw, he dead /v RACE WAR /v Genius .... /v Aw1800ful. /v Beautiful!!! /v :( /v Seems wrong. /v Killer whales are not whales, mate. 0:37 /v Circle of life!  /v God I love Orcas /v ORCAS****** /v animal cruilty /v Wow that was amazing /v 4:13 Random rainbow. /v They sound like giant killer squeak toys. /v I LIKE FUZZY WHALE /v There's a tag on the Minke's chin at 4:17 /v Why does BBC earth not show eating process itself? We see the bitten off back of the Minke whale, we see blood in the ocean, we see the blows administered by the orca pod. Lets show us how orcas actually tear off Minke meat and eat it. We humans see each other eat meat everyday at home, at work or in a restaurant don't we? /v What happened to calling them their proper name: orcas, instead of killer whales. I expect better from the BBC. /v Orcas are just as vicious underwater as the wild dogs on the land.  /v Orcas are dolphins not whales  Mike drop /v Just incredible Terry!  You da man! /v Totally Awesome! /v Beautiful work Terry. /v Beautiful! /v Very Nice one there Sir WTG /v Outstanding. /v Whatever, I'm not crying,you're crying! /v When you see the Muppets live and in person, it really makes you feel like you want to meet them and believe me, that's how I feel. /v Alright Vogel, you've won me over. /v I kind of here Jim Henson in this new Kermit voice. Nice work Matt, keep it going. /v I always loved the rainbow connection song it ages like fine wine and I hope Jim Henson is looking at this and is proud of his creations /v I frequently listen to the soundtrack for The Muppet Movie (1979), and Matt legitimately sounds like Jim here to me. I'm officially settled in and content with Matt as Kermit. /v The muppets should do more live shows. /v This song makes me cry, because I am having a hard time with my cat Annie right now. I have a feeling that she is gonna make her rainbow connection soon. /v Thanks for recording this.. I was too busy being in tears from happiness and my love of this amazing show, and my handsome Kermie.. I was so overwhelmed! I still get watery eyed just thinking of how beautiful this was. This night will be forever in my heart! I've done it.. I've seen.. R.e.m., the Monkees, Jason mraz, Penn and Teller, Adam Sandler and now my muppets.. thanks Henson and Disney! I wish life really was this positive and fun! Best night ever!  /v I'm going to cry. Kermit is my spirit animal /v he sounds like jim henson /v Somebody put this on TV, that was amazing. /v PAUL WILLIAMS! YEAH! /v I want Steve Whitmire back SO MUCH, but I have to admit Matt Vogel isn't as terrible as I thought. He kinda sounds like Jim Henson, God rest his soul /v Now Kermit doesn't sound so much like Constantine when he sings. /v OK, so I know everyone including me came to this video to see Matt's singing voice as Kermit, but watch Paul for a minute...is he lip syncing...? /v I love that the Muppets can still be so well received so many years after its debut. /v What's the big frigging deal here. Sounds a llittle like Jim but everyone has their own voice when it comes to voice acting. Im a voice actor but Im not spot on when it comes to voicing William Shatner. /v I love the new Kermit. His little, Ok? Here we go won me over. /v It's amazing that the muppets still have a big impact on pop culture to this day. But I imagined that at the climax of the song a hologram projection of Jim Henson walked to Kermit and joined him and everyone else as like a tribute. Also so younger fans can get to know the mastermind of one of the greatest shows of all time /v Say what you want about the voice, but the tiny little mannerisms in the hand movements are spot on to Jim /v I'm glad that a variety of muppets showed up. /v Taking my wife and son to tonight's concert! /v I was there, it was awesome!! /v Walter was there!!!  /v That sounded beautiful!!!!! /v Awesome I love that song /v I love the muppets R.I.P Jim Henson  /v Great since of Nostalgia \nMatts kermit is closed enough to be jims and steves kermit if u listen closely , but i miss steve as kermit /v Ahh my good friends the muppets /v this was beautiful. Matt, thank you for bringing Jim back to Kermit /v Holy crap, Kermit and Paul Williams!  Mr. Vogel you did a good job. I'd love to see a live Muppet show. *ahem US tour *ahem /v This is amazing! I love his voice he sounds like Jim. /v Only you Kermit with your beautiful voice, can understand my sorrows. /v You know I never heard it before but now I think matt vogel sounds more like jim Henson when he sings. /v I love this song...we sung it at my 6th grade graduation...eons ago /v These guys will never grow old to us for sure /v The Muppets are just amazing. They are this beautiful experience that every generation can relate to and share with each other. They are timeless. And i wish i could thank Jim personally for allowing me to share my own childhood with my niece and nephew. /v We were there too it was awesome!!  /v That's amazing! Thought we lost him  /v This is good for what is happening in Florida. (If you don't know it's hurricane Irma) #Prayforflorida /v WOW!!!!! Spectacular Kermit! /v Who voiced Link Hogthrob in the Hollywood Bowl? /v This is amazing!!! /v Hey! Do you have any of the Beat Box sketch that Scooter did right before this? I've been looking everywhere for a single video that had both, the way they dimmed the light mid-sketch then had it lit slowly to reveal the set for The Rainbow Connection was the most heart-wrenching moment of the performance, I'd do anything for it. /v This.  This is what the Muppets are (and should be) - not some backstage workplace comedy that ABC tried to push on fans a couple of years ago.\n\nAlso, tell the person chopping onions nearby to knock it off! /v It sounds like Constantine if he was American lmao\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all honesty though Vogel isn't that bad /v Such an appropriate time to sing about the dreamers.... Great song! /v I said a while ago I would decide how I felt about Matt when he sung the rainbow connection. Well now he has and I think he's great! /v Steve Whitmire was my Kermit for two decades, so of course hearing Matt Vogel's Kermit felt jarring at first, but hearing/watching this performance is a HUGE first step in embracing the new. I could get used to this :) /v Thank you so much for sharing this.  It makes my heart sing.  <3 /v I saw the show on Sunday. It was a very cool experience. This marks the second time that I have seen Rainbow Connection performed live. (The first time was at the 2011 D23 Expo.) /v this sounds so beautiful /v He kinda does sound like Jim. /v I am so psyched to actually see Paul Williams sing this song with the Muppets! :-) /v I'd like to take Jade to see the Muppet's could be one of those best days ever. I agree with Sailor Moon animgirl21 makes you feel like you want to meet them. /v Can we promote this video on the TV show The List - thelisttv.com ? We would give you verbal and graphical courtesy. Let me know, thanks! /v It's pigs in space now /v We were going to go to this but the tickets were way too expensive considering the fact that we'd be seated so far away /v My B kermit straight up auto tuned got me all the way fucked up /v Wow. If this is the. New actor or old he does a goood job /v It's like Jim Henson is back from the dead. /v Matt Vogel is really growing on me. /v Matt Vogel?\nNever heard of em /v It was the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, not the Philharmoic. /v Always Chills. Good Good Chills on many levels. /v Thank you for posting this /v I swear this is the only song they ever sing /v This makes me well up with Nostalgia. I love the Muppets so much and I'm so glad that they're still around :') /v which muppet characters do you see /v Do you have the one where Kermit the Frog tap dancing to Happy Feet with Bobby Monihan? /v Congress meets Fraggle rock.. /v Wake up ! /v Why am i crying /v Cuite /v muy lindo /v luv /v My boi Kermit /v Show\nmuppets\n31minutos APLAPLAC /v I saw this tonight, Sunday. It was a great show, this number made me cry. It reminded me of years ago when my Mom was alive. /v When he sang I immediately thought of the family guy episode where a guy pulls up in a boat and Kermit pulls a shotgun on him /v Always this feeling that Constantine is impersonating Kermit ... Also too much prerecorded video sketches and music. /v His voice is not high enough booo /v I'm sorry, but Kermit's new voice sounds too much like Constantine's impression of him. /v Matt Vogel sounds like Goofy doing a Kermit impression. And don't tell me he sounds like Jim cause he does not. This voice is deeper and has more of a southern twang. And I am not hating Steve never sound like Jim either. /v Omgghhhhhh that doesn't sound like kermie. Ewww Steve why did you do this to us! /v You have this while Disney is doing terrible reboots /v His voice is to gurgle-ie /v Kermit's new voice is terrible. I understand why they fired Steve Whitmire, but I think they should hire him back. /v Never thought that one day Constantine would take Kermit`s place ! /v Muppets haven't been watchable since Jim passed /v *i cri* /v The fact that the voice of constatine is now the voice of kermit boggles my mind. And I don't like it. /v #NotmyKermit  /v You guys... this has to be so hard for Steve to see. I miss his performance of Kermit. He put a lot of personality into that puppet. /v You're telling me they could professionally videotape The Muppet Show Live! From Muppetfest, yet they couldn't do the same thing for this and upload all of it to YouTube?! /v The muppets died with Jim. Let them die Disney please and quit using them to make money and push liberal agendas this is cancer /v I wish they had gotten the guy that's currently doing Kermit. It's clear this is actually the guy who's currently doing Ernie on Sesame Street. /v So is Sesame Street dead now that HBO has it? I don't even know. /v genial necesitamos ms eso q violencia e intolerancia en el ftbol argentino, felicitaciones Sacachispas /v que lindo es ver esto en un futbol tan violento como el nuestro /v Lstima que perdieron la guerra :v /v JAJA QUE GLADIADORES QUE LINDO QUE SE DIVIERTAN Y SOBRE TODO QUE ESTEN UNIDOS Y AU AU AU AU /v los amo. /v Soy hincha de Sarmiento y dejo los riones por mi equipo... pero estos tipos de Sacachispas son unos MAESTROS. Un aplauso gigante a esos muchachos que dejan todo y desdramatizan el fulbo. GENIOS!!! /v Porque quedaron afueraaa :( /v genios /v Aprende seleccin estos jugadores son los q tienen wuebos de verdad /v Q viva el futbol seores, humildad y amor al futbol tienen estos tipos, lo viven como se lo tiene q vivir... /v Que grosos los de sacachispas, lastima que se disfrazaron de espartanos si en la pelicula la terminan pecheando contra los persas =( /v SEGURO Q SACACHISPAS LE GANABA A VENEZUELA!!!!! ESTOY SEGURO /v son unos grosos. cayeron como los 300 de termopilas en sarandi :v /v Que grande los de sacachispas los felicito /v ARGENTINA PRESENTE AMARGADOS ... /v buena.esa /v xDDDDDD /v CRACKS jajaja /v JAJAJ que capos /v Son unos genios /v argentinos. ridiculos dan pena ajena bobos /v jajajaja /v Le falta carne :/ /v Get the oscar spot ready on the Mantle /v Lagrimn! Pero que alguien le cambie la peluca a Roger, por favor. /v Exagerada la actuacion de los puetazos al principio /v Wow. He's got Freddie down. /v It's Rami voice? Really good voice! /v OMG, MI CORAZN, JODEEER. /v Un poquito exagerado los movimientos diria yo.... /v He looks good but he also looks like he has a weird giant head. /v This was obviously centered on Rami and his playing of Freddie but for the few moments we saw the other members they all have their guys down pat. That John Deacon bow was spot on. /v wow I have never said this about a biopic before, but I'm looking forward to this /v Muchooooo xito  /v Lo que est claro es que esto ya tiene forma por fin. Y en cuanto estos vdeos que seguramente saldrn ms no hay que hacerles mucho caso, ya que en una pelcula hay miles de tomas que finalmente no salen ella, (espero que esta sea una de ellas). El nico que no se parece tanto es Freddie, los dems prcticamente son igualitos. Habr que esperar el resultado final, no es lo mismo verlo desde la grabacin de un mvil y desde una distancia a verlo en el cine con las mejores cmaras y el mejor audio. /v Bisogna lasciare assolutamente la voce di Freddie ,non c  niente di meglio che la sua voce in quella giornata.\nBisogna poi non concentrarsi troppo su questa esibizione, che  stata forse la pi iconica di sempre, semplicemente unica cos come \nMercury  inimitabile o si va ancora pi nei dettagli e si rasenta la perfezione o i fan di Fred ,che sono fan attentissimi e che ci tengono molto ,troveranno il tutto una scimmiottatura, attenta produzione, il confine fra un capolavoro e un flop mai come in questo caso pu essere sottile !! /v he's got the look down. and the shimmy, haha /v That's a lovely lovely voice. Rami's gonna nail it. /v I HOPE THE FREDDIE MOVES ARE GETTING SMOOTHER....TOO CHOREOGRAPHED. /v el mejor Fredy Mercury  /v Luke Spiller would have been a better choice. /v I m gonna cry my lung out..my freddie ..why did u left angel. /v Eu achei que ficou bom, mas ficou meio que exagerado nas atuaes de Rami. Mas ficou legal /v Me parece que a Rami le falta un poco de musculatura y no exsagar tanto en lo movimientos . Bueno en realidad me parece que lo estoy comparando demasiado con Freddie y nadie lo va a poder igualar, nisiquiera en su forma de moverse en el escenario. /v SPETTACOLARE /v Wow! /v wow!!!!!! /v Buenazo /v para mi esta bien,nadie nunca va a igualar al gran freddie pero para la movie sivesta pasable mucha suerte la espero ansiosa. /v Damnn! /v O DIOSSSS /v Gran impresin del Live Aid /v Suerte mucha suerte,Que nadie olvide  al Gran Freddie /v Al principio no pens que fueran los dobles  estn geniales estoy sorprendida  /v Por fin se har realidad  mucha suerte a Rami y al resto de la produccin!!  /v marc martel /v WOW! /v Rami did a really good job, but if they were filming, I'd recommend doing it again, honestly. He needs to move a bit more like Freddie, he puts his shoulders up a little to much and the timing was a bit bad. /v This is the era where people watching directly not thru camera phone. /v Was is sped up? If not then it looked really bad.i mean look at what he's doing with his arms. Looks like sieg heil. There is no fines in how he moves. Really really bad acting. /v Fix the teeth. Freddie was no Bugs Bunny; he was Freddie Mercury AND PLEASE rent a hose so Malek can appear to be the Persian Popinjay! Also, Malek will need to incorporate Freddie's fierce expression at times or it wont work. /v esa es la voz de marc martel, tal vez est colaborando con la pelicula /v Los criticos somos nosotros los fans espero q sea gran pelicula no un negocio saludos amigas y amigos /v Nos quejamos durante aos porque este proyecto no avanzaba, y una vez que se vuelve real, empiezan a criticar todo. Encima es solo un detrs de escena, ni siquiera se sabe si es una toma que va a quedar. Sean ms contemplativos, queridos. /v Joder, que buenas carcajadas me he aventado con esto, los movimientos si son exagerados creo que hasta yo lo puedo mejorar, ah hace falta practicar, por cierto Rami usa unos pantalones acampanados fuera de moda muy setenteros...Los de Freddie no eran as, la forma de moverse de John Deacon bien despreocupado vay toma suinstrumentojaja y Roger ese peluqun(se ve de lejos)y medio enano al parecer tiene que dar grandes saltos hasta la batera para llegar, espero cambien esos detalles en la pelcula final. /v I'M CONFUSED. IS RAMI SINGING OR MARC MARTEL? /v hope theres plenty of gay club action /v You can't fool me with all you're techno jargon.  It's witchcraft plain and simple! /v Nice Youtube. I've been thinking for a long time that microwave could be used for speaker feedback. This would work with just a comparator. I haven't been able to build it, not my field, but nice to know something like this exists. /v Step 1: Draw some eldritch symbols on the copper layer of a pcb.\nStep 2: Put some components randomly on that pcb.\nStep 3: Make an offering to the microwave god.\nStep 4: Profit! /v Physics is very interesting subject indeed! your videos have quality and my best wishes for the channel to have million subscribers. /v Great video Kerry. Assuming it can tune below 10.5 Ghz I see the foundation for an amateur transceiver. /v Thank you for sharing Kerry, very interesting. I know nothing about this subject, now I want to know more. Best regards, Joel /v Kerry, fantastic. I love it. I know nothing of this field. You lifted the curtain enough that I have vocabulary to learn more. Many thanks. /v Murica /v I remember hearing this on the original L & O as well...thank you for posting this. /v Is there an episode for this? /v IM SO PROUD OF RIHANNA /v That glow Jeffieeeeee . /v F U Racist bastard /v On point  /v LOVE YOU BITCH!! ;) WINK WINK /v Where tf is your eyebrows dude /v Wtf is this guy /v Yessss werkkkkk mammaaa /v same /v It /v Love your review! /v get away from rihanna u racist roach /v Jeffree i love your hair! /v Dislike :) /v HE LOOKS LIKE STROMAE /v He looks like Bella Thorne :v /v that kim k shade... /v Your nails are fucking life _ /v I LOVE THISSS /v Negative comment /v so pigmented /v what is this? /v Yessssssssssss  /v I absolutely love u.... ur realness u always make me smile honey in my hectic bz mums life /v I have never had an outloud reaction to a makeup swatch, and then you put that fucking TROPHY WIFE on your face and I literally yelped HOLY FUCK /v Uhg I want to love trophy wife so bad but it's just way too yellow based for me  That amount of pigment and shine is amaziinnnggg /v I just feel like the whole face of make up doesn't look that good /v As much backlash he's gotten he's a damn make up guru stfu  he's the reason why I bought this damn line ! Thanks Jeff  /v I dont know why ,but for me...i feel like it makes  him look fresh on the face... /v Those blue dots scared the shit out of me /v he is so gorgeous without makeup /v Great review. I love reviews from those that own their own makeup lines, and are involved in all aspects of the business. I will likely try the foundation, cream shimmer sticks, and the foundation brush. Jeffree can pull off any look, and while the gold highlight is pretty, it wouldn't work for my skin tone. Although, it might make a pretty eyeshadow for those of us that are extremely fair. /v I used to like Jeffree Starr until I found out he is extremely racist. Rihanna herself said she did not want him to do a review of her makeup becuase he is the opposite of what her makeup line stands for. /v I'm so fucking confused /v oh no.....the oxidation by the end of the video is HORRIBLE  /v The fucking quality of this video is better than my eyes /v i love you so much jeffree :) keep doing u booo /v You speak as if Rihanna did anything other than sell her name for the brand. /v You are by far not worthy of reviewing her fucking shit. So inclusive yeah something you arent. You are discusting and proved that you have not changed from your racist ways. Fucking gross. /v Isn't the primer $32? /v The fuck is this shit /v Ain't that the bitch from the jerry show wit the green wig??!??!? /v Jeffree how are you just gonna put foundation on the face of your tattoo and not say anything?????  I fucking love you /v That moment when he did Grandma's foundation... So cute!! /v What shade of foundation did you get? /v Errtime he would flashed those highlighters booii my eyes would huuuuurt but oml those highlights are the bomb /v The foundation is a little dark, but you look stunning with the slight tan color! /v Very informative video. I will take your suggestion and buy these products. /v I shouldn't be allowed to review a colored girl makeup because you don't deserve to after what you said. /v First time watching your videos\nIm inlove with you...\nLol /v Jeffre I just found out there is mermaid brushes /v How to gain black viewers back: Do a video on make up by a black woman and for get all of the racist shit he has said /v The contour looked hard to blend out and kind of weird imo almost patchy /v glr u gotta go 10 shades lighter with that stick tf /v Love how you still tell us how your applying your makeup and what to do tips!! /v Jeffree you look beautiful with blonde hair, and I love how you style it. /v This is extremely irrelevant and random, but I think Jefree should do a Marilyn Manson inspired make up look. White foundation and all.  /v not a fan of the gold highlighter /v i don't even wear makeup but I liked the way you reviewed the products /v I need to buy some of those omg! I have never been this excited to try a make up product /v That foundation is everything!!! /v love you! (coming from a black woman).  /v I'm new to his channel and everything people say about him seems so unreal he's such a sweetheart at least to me he had such an awesome reality yes everybody makes mistakes but that was in the past let that stuff go nigger affects you when a white person says it but our black ignorant asses say it to each other everyday and laugh so don't come for him calling him rascist when we are rascist to each other playing or not IT IS OFFENSIVE PERIOD /v I always trust your reviews of products because you know so much about makeup! Live for your vids!  /v oooh no boo, dont look like that /v I've been using the Trophy Wife highlight as a shadow instead bc i'm more fair skinned. It really is BEAUTIFUL! /v I wonna look as plastic and fake a possible /v he's applying the damn thing on the woman tattooed on his neck /v How do I keep him from popping up in my feed... /v I went out and bought trophy wife and the foundation and I'm in LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v I love how inclusive Fenty is to different  shades of color.  Very impressive.  Loved this video, Jefree. /v What shade was this? /v That's it ... I'm going to Sephora  /v This is so sick! /v I died and came back to life when Jeffree did the flashlight test with the gold /v Talk about don't look at the sun during the eclipse bitchhhhhhh that eclipse ain't got shit on this highlight... /v does anybody knows what camera is he using ? is amazing /v Bruh KKW be the drug store brand while Riri over here with these luxury items  /v The Kylie and Kim are SHAKINGGG /v I don't need anybody's approval but Jeffree's! /v How is your skin so perfect?  /v I so love him /v OMG SHE PUT FOUNDATION ON THE LADY OF THE TATTOO HAHAHAHAHA /v Dang...they love the number 32. Almost everything cost $32 /v Just started my channel. \n\nWatch my new video! and subscribe!    \n\nPlease and thanks  \n\n /v You are so beautiful /v This video definitely gave me very positive vibes toward Jeffrey. It made me finally subscribe  /v Laughing so hard! Gunna douse myself in it and put on my high heels!  You're the best! /v The lighting makes you look super tan. It's kind of trippy. /v You're so gorgeous  /v That Gold Glitter Highlighter is obviously the Seller /v Defiantly buying some Fenty!, Thanks for the review, flawless.  /v THE HIGHLIGHTERS WOW /v The foundation doesnt oxsidies it sets which makes it dark. It doesnt  gradually gets darker /v The pale highlighters look good on you... but trophy wife looks very yellow on you; it seems like it was made for darker skin. /v ok we get it yall.....he said some bs in the past and has apologized millions of times. i mean what else do you want him to do? sheesh. yall pick and choose who Yall wanna crucify but Quick to suppport others who have done some things in the past as well. Half of yall love eminem and mark wallberg(spelling?) and justin beiber (spelling?) but dont know That  they also have done/said racist things in the past.......yall quick to excuse them but go to bash another. same thing with the chris brown abuse scandal......yall excused Dr. Dre for beating on 2 women because he's a hiphop legend and yall liked the movie NWA lmaooo. fucking bandwagon ass people smh. like i said  yall pick and choose who to bash. /v This makeup looks like trash /v Thank you for doing this makeup review! My sister and I were in Sephora and we loved Trophy Wife and we wanted to try the foundation out but didn't! Also there were some pretty fucked up videos saying that Rihanna didn't want you to review her makeup because you were racist. Like who the fuck even says that! Weren't you invited to the launch? It even mentioned how you don't deserve to review it and that pissed me off.  Not only because I love you  but because anyone can review any makeup they want and some loser hater bitches are just jelly. /v WHY DON'T YOU AFRICAN FOLKS GET BACK TO AFRICA AND SPEAK YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LIVE WHERE YOU BELONG AND LEAVE US CAUCASIAN PEOPLE AND OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ALONE AND GO FUCK YOURSELVES! GO MIND YOUR OWN AFRICAN BUSINESS IN AFRICA LIKE THE ASIANS MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS IN ASIA LEAVE CAUCASIAN WHITE PEOPLES ALONE. GO HOME. GO MAKE SOME POP AND RAP MUSIC IN YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES IN AFRICA YOU MUDDAFUCKAS! /v I may sound stupid to a lot of you, but what does it mean when foundation oxidizes? /v Finished at last!\nNow back to glow stick chemistry. /v Next big project, how to make acid?? Yo think of all the patrons you would get for that one....  And yh strictly for educational purposes ofcourse /v This is such a accomplishment, it really should be appreciated for all that went into it. I hope this knowledge bomb sets off a chain reaction of shared information to get people inspired to investigate, do, make, learn and invent. /v Recommendations for future videos/projects: 1. Explain and illustrate how compounds without gaseous products can explode (eg. Cu2C2, other metal acetylides), or 2. Find a method of removing denatonium benzoate (bitrex) from denatured alcohol (to really get the government on your door!) /v what we learned:\nyou can make anything from anything else /v YOU DID IT! YOU ARE THE ONE WHO KNOCKS! /v virtual high five /v Damn! Look at the view count! That's 5 times more than usual! /v Since you said making it from domestically available chemicals makes about as much sense as making computers from sand, I think that would be a great project for someone to do and document in a video series. /v Amazing thank you :) for entertaining and educating us /v Sell it to the banana republics and earn a fortune;) /v If you want to do a big project, think about what is party need ^o^ /v so at the end of the day, is it easier to take an advance chemist course or just to buy the stuff? /v Nurd the acetone peak I bet is from your lab connection person cleaning the NMR tubes with acetone. Here in my lab we clean them with water then acetone then stick them in the oven. It's not uncommon for a little bit of acetone to be left over in the NMR spectrum /v Congratulations!!!  What an accomplishment.  It's been very fun to watch. /v Personally i think you should have a larger project ongoing interspersed with smaller simpler things. /v What a random thing to make. I guess it emphasizes your goal to make anything from anything. /v so loong way just for Pyrimethamine\ngreat effort you did there /v THAT'S JUST COOL, In an apocalyptic setting chemist will be kings any one who can make aspirin from some bark is soooo going to be rolling in bottle caps!!\n\nACTUALLY, can you make Asprin? like if your in a none ideal environment like a juried lap I mean nothing that would risk your safety or anything but If your in a post apocalyptic setting making basic medicines would be a huge advantage. /v been watching this process the entire 2 years youve been working on it. and im no chemist. to be honest i barely follow the names of the chems you use to do this, but its satisfying to see the reactions. congrats from a regular joe man. you blew my mind on this one. /v Heres an idea. Platytoxin. Suppose to be a very hard chemical to sythansize :) /v Fuck yes! Congratulations man!! Been a great journey watching this. Am so pleased it finally paid off!! /v Well done! I haven't been here for the whole process as a lot of organic reactions are a bit too complex for an amateur-amateur like me.\nBut anyone can see it's worth celebrating when you come out of two years research with a big green tick in the checkbox.\nKeep up the great work... you are the one person who made me realise that YouTube wan't just about pirated music videos and people hiding turds in each others lunchboxes. /v Wow , has it really been two years ? Time flys. Next project ? LSD from domestically availability chemicals /v One of the great youtubers of this time. /v I absolutely loved this series. Semi-complex organic chemistry is fun to watch. Plus the added benefit of thinking about making medications in a dire scenario. /v $22K on a single video series! I admire the dedication, I largely gave up making videos after $2k in return-less investment on YouTube. /v That's all you have to do?! simple /v looks like you could build amphetamine from this molecule. is that possible? /v Congrats on the success! I have to echo sediment here. Get this thing published, if only to thumb your nose at Pharma. That and the sodium metal discovery.\n\nNow, for future projects, why not something a little more light-hearted? It be awesome to see you come up with some experiments that are for kids, or can be done by kids. Get the next generation excited about science! /v Genuinely impressive, you've made me appreciate and enjoy learning (Attempt to understand ) chemistry in a way my teachers never did :) /v WIsh you could show how to make alprazolam lol it would help me a lot /v Congratulations!  I enjoyed the series. /v Well done sir. A legend among chemists has just arisen. /v I would only inject Pyrimethamine made by Turing Pharmaceuticals into my eyeballs. /v It would be really interesting to see you separate the specific alkaloids of nightshade plants. /v What about synthesis of Ambazone or Indolylacetic acid? /v Just swing for the fences and try and decipher what the hell starlite was /v I've followed and wached every step in your pyrimethamine synthesis with all the struggels and set backs. It is awesome you've finally synthesized pyrimethamine  from household chemicals!! Thanks for not giving up and continuing this project great work!! I hope you've enjoyed the road to this succes! /v Amazing! Congratulations, it's been fun seeing this progress over the last 2 years! /v 9:40 it can be product of oxidasing of methanol. /v Congratulations! Also, I want that map on a shirt. /v Fucking hell man. Amazing job.  I'm so glad I found your channel years ago so I could follow along on the ride /v Thanks for the series! I don't understand much of the formulas you present but it has been intriguing for me to watch the progress. Could you shed a light (on another video?) how these chemical formulas are formed i.e when you mix something, how do you know what will happen and what will be the result and how to write the reaction to paper? /v can you try and make acetaminophen /v I would like to see a commentary about the whole process and where things failed or where things can be done better. Things that where fun and things that where a wee bit crazy. /v Could you please do a grignard Reaction for one of your next videos ? /v This is so cool, congratulations. It's really cool that the public can now watch a graduate level research project from start finish. Hopefully you open peoples eyes :) /v CONGRATS!!!!! Well done, and I look forward to more videos!! /v Martin Shkreli came to dislike the video 41 times /v Holy crap, you did it man!\n\nTwo years, and you refused to give up; that is very admirable.\n\nHuuuuge congrats! /v For some reason I didn't get my videos from you flagged /v that is an insane price @_@!!!! /v Do you think a foam metal pellet inside a pressurized tube could be saturated with liquid oxygen?  Like a sponge... /v H E I S E N B E R G  /v Congratulations!  You made it! /v I bet you could make some straight fire crack, honky. You are wasting your talents. /v Congratulations on job well done! I understand very little about chemistry, but I do like to learn more every day. Thank you for reminding me (us) that failure is part of the process and the journey is the reason to go anywhere. /v Congats and hats off to you!\n\nIt's been long while, and amazing series. \n\nI wonder if theres something that used to be commonly made but not anymore that you could reproduce using modern chemistry. Like say certain plastics? /v I've waited so long for this, thank you so much for working so hard on it. /v Bravo!!!!! \n\nWhere there's a will there is a way!!!  Big up's to all the home scientist!!! /v Silly NurdRage. Big Pharma doesn't price medication against cost to manufacture.\nThey're all about treating us, not curing, so we buy more PILLS.\nI'm only razzin' you. Great job! /v Hey NurdRage, I would like to make manganese metal from thermite, but I would like to to use zinc metal instead of aluminum powder because you have a video on how to make zinc powder, and manganese dioxide from the video about getting it from batteries. I was wondering if this was even remotely possible or not at all. If it is you could try it and add it as a video for your thermite reactions. \n\nP.S. I love your videos they are very inspiring for me. /v This shit better be trending by the time I get back here. /v if I ever get malaria I'll give you a call..lol nice work. /v Next time what you could do when you screw up or get stuck on a step would be to order the chemical and go on to the next step and then go back and fill in the missing steps. I have been following this for the whole time and wish I could see all the failures. I am a chem student and would be interesting. I know that most people aren't chem majors but hey thats why we have youtube where we can see really specific content and don't have to worry about things being dumbed down so the average idiot who is afraid of math can understand. Thanks for the inspiration I plan on doing similar things with my new found knowledge. /v can you please make the whole procedure as one video, it will be interesting to see, even if over 1 hour /v Congratulations! You have earned it. \n\nAlso I just signed up for your patreon. /v Congratulations for your achievements! You have been so inspiring to me that I have started to study chemistry in university :) Because chemicals here in EU regions are very controlled, it's hard to get anything like you have as a easily available domestic chemical and because of that, being amateur chemist in EU region is pretty hard. So it's nice to see real chemical syntheses and experimentations. /v Well done!  In my opinion, it's been worth all the effort you've put in.  I've watched each video from start to finish & have enjoyed it all.  Even though I haven't any background in chemistry - outside of high school - I'm still fascinated by it.  Keep up the great work! /v *@NurdRage: You didn't do bad at all as far as price goes.* _According to Wikipedia: In the United States in 2015, Pyrimethamine was not available as a generic medication and the price was increased from 13.50 USD to 750 USD a tablet (75,000 USD for a course of treatment). In other areas of the world it is available as a generic and costs as little as 0.05 to 0.10 USD per dose._ *Something is seriously wrong, when your method described here is cheaper then it was in the US.* /v Amazing result! Cheers! /v Congratulations, NurdRage! /v Make MDMA next. /v Your welcome /v Kudos!!! /v Congratulations NurdRage! You completed the pyrimethamine synthesis! /v brilliant NR well done /v $22,000??? Holy shit! /v Congrats. /v Congrats NurdRage! /v good job bruh\n\nnow eat it ;) /v Well done Dr. Lithium! /v VICTORY! /v Well done /v Congratulations! /v HOOAH /v Awesome congrats! /v What a journey! /v the true MVP /v well done sir /v Congratubrilliance! /v Congrats! What'll be next? /v It's doooooooooone!!!!! :D /v Are you going to publish the sodium thing? /v This video is unviewable in your country due to a copyright claim by Martin Shkreli. /v You can finally put this project to bed, well done man!\nSide-note: You might want to look at some interviews with Shkreli. I've personally done a 180 on the guy since you started this project, because his reasons for doing what he did are actually pretty legit. Daraprim is a terrible drug and he put all the revenue from it into new R&D for a replacement that wouldn't have so many side effects. /v so on a danger diamond this would have 4s all around eh?? /v Can someone explain why this is notable? \n\nThis drug isn't currently covered under a patent AFAIK, so have other companies (Besides Shkreli's) not made it themselves because they don't know how? Is the uploader the only person (other than people affiliated with Shkreli's company) to synthesize it?\n\nSomeone please explain. /v Daraprim is already practically FREE as is. The only people paying $750 are insurance companies and hospitals. People literally do not even bother to do any research anymore. They read some headline and then hop on the nearest chat/comment section to express their new-found knowledge. /v conclusion:\nthe book is more gory than the mini series /v Now I can't stop thinking of Beverly marsh ... lol /v Can't wait to see this movie..I've just been consumed by Destiny lol /v What a pity that you guys can't help but let your leftist ideology slip through the cracks. /v song at the end /v Nothing solidify's a good friendship like a seven way gangbang, in a filthy sewer from hell.  It would of been awesome if Bev's Dad walked in on them. That was clearly his biggest fear. Those kids would have bigger problems then that clown. /v Now I know why my grandparents wont let me read the book till I'm older..... My mom hasn't read it and she says I can but I think Ill wait /v i loved the miniseries so much /v I'd like to see you talk about the new movie. It seemed to me that some of the characters were given much smaller roles and only a handful are important. /v so how the fuck do i get into the losers club where do i sign? /v racial insensitivity when talking about Richies jokes... times were different, people werent uptight like they are now. /v Mike DOES find a picture of Georgie in the book. It's just in a different location and under different circumstances. Bill mentions it being the picture that went missing from Georgie's photo album. /v Space Turtle and Underage gang bang.\n\nStephen King and his coauthor: Meth. /v Oh shit she fucks them one after the other? Lmfao yo wtf /v The old it was way creepier than the new one. The new it is definitely more entertaining however /v So the kids had an orgy /v there is a book, and you do the whole remake thing, meh /v 9:14-9:45\nWhat the hell, King? /v war of the worlds and war of the worlds ( 2005 ) /v been waiting for this /v Do an IT trailer /v Thank you guys for doing Blade Runner/Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep What's The Difference next, I'm super excited now! /v I miss John Ritter and Jonathan Brandis /v I got to read the book /v the ONLY reason i  disliked it is because i could be the 1000th dislike otherwise i would like it /v If Stranger Things had started out as a Stephen King novel, when Eleven started to undress in front of the boys instead of stopping her they would have let her get naked, then gotten naked themselves, took turns having sex with Eleven, and because they had sex with her the boys would have gained their own psychic powers. Also Dr. Brenner would make it clear that once Eleven hit puberty he planned on impregnating her personally the old fashioned way to see if her powers could be passed on genetically. /v teeth are sooooo ugly and disgusting but not scary  /v tl:dw In movie kids don't fuck in the sewer /v *I hate these douchebags that say the it movie free in the comments* /v Yeah, an interdimensional daemon with unknown origins but he just scare and kill children for fun. /v Steven King, why don't you take a seat. /v Be gone thot /v Narnia next please...... /v Local assholes  /v CARRIE,  CARRIE,  CARRIE /v Tim Curry's Performance Gave Me Chills! /v  /v Now do the mini-series VS the movie. xD /v never have that woman again please. /v Really interested if you all are going to look at the 2017 not-John-Hughes IT. /v Why do the Beverley in the 2017 vers. have sex with all the boys in the group? That's so DISGUSTING AND VILE that a image of pre-teen GANGBANG just conjured up in my mind. Did the reviewers said they all had sex in the sewers? That just made it WORSE for me now. I gotta to get this out my mind, probably going to watch the original movie again. /v good intentions\nbut seems a bit dumbed down... /v Due to budgetissuesthey had to leave to letters out of the title. /v They did mike hanlon so bogus in the new movie /v Would you like it in alphabetical order???? /v Who is this chick? Fuck she ruins what was going to be an incredible episode. I genuinely can't tell if she's trying to do a Pennywise high-pitched clown voice for comedic purposes or if that's her actual voice. Either way, she's got a voice for modeling. /v Seeing the old clips it seems they even brought back the odd lip-syncing for Pennywise, as if the lines were added later. Dunno if that's supposed to be intentional for both movies since It's a cosmic horror, but... /v IT is not a demon, but a cosmic being or eldritch abomination like Cthulhu or Gozer from Ghostbusters. /v Wtf is up with this comment section? It's all broken english. /v Why does old Bill from 1990's Stephan King's It look like Sam from Supernatural? /v how the hell do you smell silver??? /v You should do this again with the new movie /v i love this movie /v Stephen King is planning to do a book signing of IT at Comet Ping Pong. /v It's a beautiful Tim Curry out toda-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! /v Buttom line... Stephen King can be pretty fucked up to put it mildly. /v So basically Penywise is just an excuse for Stephen King to write a book about child sex and gore? I'm... starting to think maybe this guy isn't someone I should respect. \nWhatever a writer writes about, the subject matter can be inspired, but ultimately the content of the book is a revealing insight into the mind of the writer... Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers. A hell of a lot more than we would think is probably the answer. /v CAN YOU PLZ DO A HOMEMADE IT TRAILER!? /v Did you legit just say Steven and not Stephen? /v Wanna fix a problem? Have sex with all of your friends! That's a good idea... right? /v I don't remember the spider part /v Something, something, kid gang bang, something, something, bad.   Now give me your likes! Everyone else is doing it. /v 9:33 are we gonna ignore the fact that Stephen King as a grown man made a decision to include a group a 12 year olds running a train on another 12 year old girl even though he could've written literally anything else in the story to symbolize that they loved each other /v Best Pennywise line - \n\nKiss me fat boy! /v Adultery/underage fornication/ the disgusting etc isn't loving.. who taught these kids? Satan? /v What's the plural of medium? /v 10:10 *what can Stephen King cut with a 1,000 degree knife?!?!?1!?1?!?!!?1?!?* /v Correction: It were THREE bullies that were involved with throwing the homosexual man over the bridge. /v ...And this is why I've never felt inclined to pick up one of his novels. Yeah, they're LONG books... but people don't read books just to say they've carried around a giant weight with words inside and looked at them all. The book trailer or little blurb won't win you over unless you are a die-hard horror fan, maybe. When it comes to what you hear about them outside of that? They sound dull, gross, and pretentious at the same time. I don't see the appeal. /v 9:47 Wasn't it Bill who initiated this? /v tim is the only reason this thing was scary /v I understand that Stephen King is supposed to be a genius and all but you have to be a really sick fuck to write about children fucking each other /v Tip; drop all the dumb leftie crap like 'm-muh racial insensitivity' and similar. /v The difference to me.... The first was awesome with great acting. The second was lame, not scary at all & Pennywise wasn't half the clown Tim Curry was. Why choose a pretty boy to play what was suppose to be such a scary part? IT from the 90s wins, hands down! Very disappointed in this new one. /v pennywise isn't a demon, he is  a sickness brought on by the breaking of the beams and the assault on the dark tower by the Crimson King /v I liked the older one more.\nJust seemed like the story was easier to follow. /v Please do I Know What You Did Last Summer the book is not even a slasher like the movie and they're remaking it although the director said he won't be making something closer to the book it's going to be all new so my question is why? /v the dead kid and the picture of Georgie is pretty much like this in the book. The 85 murders begin and then as Mike builds up the evidence to be sure to call his paws one of the things that makes him certain that it's It they are dealing with is the picture of Georgie that disappeared in 58 after it winked at bill /v I have never seen a Youtube channel that has more bots spamming it that CineFix. /v Here's a fun fact:  The kid playing young Richie is Seth Green, known for his voice acting on Robot Chicken.  So voices are his game now. /v I don't remember Stan brutally chopping himself up in the book.  It's been about five years since I read the book.  Anybody want to fill me in on what happened if I'm wrong? /v I wish they kept the them running a train part from the books in the new adaption. /v Fucking hell, what an annoying ass video. Those narrator/ presenters are awful. /v 13:01 HAHAHAHAHA WTF?? I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PART AND IM GLAD I DID NOW /v With the notable exception of Carrie the only really good adaptations of Stephen King's novels are the non-supernatural ones. /v METAPHOR......SURE! /v Being scared of clowns is actually a pretty new fear. From about the 2000s and mostly in the US. /v WAHA WAHA /v  /v American psycho /v Clowns are not scary /v Do IT 2017 homemade trailer /v #clownlivesmatter /v I miss cassy redmen /v Woah, MARTHA? /v Big misconception that the miniseries also takes place in 1958. As with the current film it was moved forward a bit, though not as drastically. Book is 1958 - 1985 and the miniseries is 1960 - 1990. /v I've never read the book, but I keep hearing about this Orgy at the end of the book.......... Did they all just take turns fucking the girl or something? How did that even come about? I'm a busy man and don't have time to read the book, it would be helpful if someone could fill me in. /v The Langoliers than? Please!!!!! /v DO DEATHNOTE NEXT!     ANIME VS MANGA /v So the only female in the club in the book is a slut. I mean sure the sex orgy was a bonding ritual, but essentially the girl banged more than one boy. Worse in one sequence: one after the other. How did she not get pregnant? /v OH MY GOD FUCKING ROAST ME QUEEN!!!! YES!! /v why do I feel like she tries to act like pewidiepie and jenna marbles combined into? only this is a 100x more annoying... I'm disappointed in the internet for making her a popular and relevant youtuber.... same goes for jake and logan paul /v Only Christine would make a video like this . /v Some people in my class have holo books and i want but i am to awkward to ask where they got them from \n\nAlso i wonder if you could put that holo powder on pencils lol /v I'd like to see some um...nails. If that's not too much to ask. Just kidding who actually comes on here for nails anymore, I'm here for the SAVAGE ROASTS! /v What has liza done to you  /v You and Ben need to start a prank war and record it ! /v Cristine is like a Canadian female pewdiepie /v Bahd bahibe is a utuber and she would be a dope colab /v SHE CALLED CONNOR FRANTA MALCOM IN THE MIDDLE OH MY GOD IM SO DEAD  /v C: Hey its Dan or Phil\nOverly Phandom Members: CHRISTINE ITS DANIEL! OKAY CATCH UP /v This is the content I came for /v It's videos like this that make me feel bad for Ben. /v I'm not a doctor or anything but my brother has eczema and the only thing that's worked for him has been the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream /v Christine!

We NEED TO KNOW!!\nhttps://youtu.be/fbg91NTQ1-E /v The gabby show  I heard you gotta nose job couldn't fix your nails why they were at it ..bitch /v That's fucked up yea its just a joke but Logan is color blind not cool /v Holographic solar eclipse nails.. \nOr holographic moon phases.. same shit.\nRecreate Nikki tutorials' nails. \nLinear Holographic stamping on glitter holo, with a holo taco... \n holo water marble \n gelly marble over holo  \n holo French manicure\n holo geode inspired drag marble nails\n holo peel off base coat\nHolo can you go... do the have magnet reactive holo? Like the nail polish that you held the magnet over and it would make the weird design? I can't think of any other ideas right now lol /v Ben should do a challenge where he picks a nail from her peely bag and tries to re-create it. /v I need a serie of this who else? /v U SLAAAAYEDDD IT. I was watching this in class and going OHHHHHHH the whole time and my friends actually thought I was going insane  /v I still never got a reply about simplynaillogical2 and I am a huge fan but I love Joey so much and plz don't Mack fun of hem on your Channel please /v Do a nail tutorial of painting Ben's face DO IT  PLZ  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW I LOVE UR CHANNEL /v You should totally do a wish.com haul of nail stuff! /v Try to make holographic gems on your nails. I'd be disappointed if you think you can't. /v I was laughing so hard when she said this...\n''Nerdy Nummi'sMore like Nubies'' /v Do celebrities next, wanna see what you say about them Cristine /v Today I noticed that I didnt see anymore videos from you on my page.

Amazballz /v hahaha amazing! /v Awesome ! lol /v Omg..i love this.. /v brilliant /v Brilliant!!!!! /v Brilliant ! /v Whoo! /v It's cool ! Wow! /v This titled me /v  /v QUE HINO /v Does anyone see Ros /v some people seem to assume that this guy is making these facial expressions out of humor during very traumatic time. Exaggerated facial expressions are forms of grammar necessary in Sign Language to make sure those who need it understand the severity of the situation. It may seem funny to us but its fairly common for this to be done. I think its awesome and I can totally see the humor and if people take that, thats cool but understand this isn't being done to mock or joke about the situation. He is doing his job as best as he could and I feel he did it brilliantly. /v To all viewers who do not know American Sign Language:I am deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). This guy is doing a fantastic job of interpreting for the deaf! His facial adverbs equate with the spoken inflection and gravity of the emergency situation. Hurricane Irma is a serious threat and it cannot be taken lightly. This certified deaf interpreter just conveyed that. /v His facial expressions enhanced his explaining.....I thought he explained this dam good. /v He's a Cerified deaf interpreter (CDI). He does not hear the noises he's making. How it works is a hearing interpreter sits in front of the deaf interpreter and signs what is being said. The Deaf interpreter then interprets that into American Sign Language. Deaf interpreters are used because a native user/speaker of a language can convey the meaning clearer than a non-native native signer. Deaf interpreters are the best choice in a emergency situation (and many other situations) to meet the communication needs of the entire Deaf Community. There are different dialects of sign language. This interpreter interpreted the information in a way that any deaf person can understand...which is the point. /v I would like this guy to translate everything I say. /v This guy just made about 900 GIFs. /v This guy is the next internet meme. /v ROTFLMFAO - With all of the horrible news of the hurricane, THIS GUY brings forth a new way to watch these otherwise gloomy news conferences /v Oh my goodness, I know this is serious and all but they found the Italian De Niro Sign Language Guy :) /v adding some humour during a crisis lol love this guy /v Somebody is gonna be getting replaced by subtitles... /v You should probably amend that to Gov Rick Scott gives a warning with ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter, emphasizing the seriousness the situation for the deaf/hard of hearing audience. There IS a difference - putting deaf first implies that the interpreter cannot hear, which is obviously false since he is listening to Gov Scott and interpreting into signs.\n\nEdited to add: I saw Pam's comment. I stand corrected. /v ..You hoax people know nothing first  in some cause 's they use facial expression  like in Florida ..Know the  facts before you credits some thing that you know nothing about . sing langue /v He's effing awesome /v Is this like Dolby surround sound for the deaf? /v People don't realize that he isn't being overly enthusiastic or anything like that. This is just sign language. That is what sign language looks like. You use facial expressions like a hearing person might use vocal pitch. I love ASL so much becasue of that! /v It's funny because he's not trying to be funny, he's just trying to be as clear and expressive as possible. /v Yeah, I know that chick. Crazy in the head and crazy in the bed. /v Honestly I never knew sign language includes facial expressions, now I know. /v He thought governor was talking about an ex wife. /v HE FORGOT THE 7 IN THE PHONE NUMBER- EPIC FAIL? /v Pause at 0:58, hilarious with his tongue out. Yes, I'm well aware that's the only way to emphasize in sign language, but still, it's funny. But what's even funnier is what is the point of all the men just standing around the governor like statues, it's pointless. Just have governor Scott and the signer up there. /v He's one of a few that caught my eye.  I agree, he's a great bit of humorous uplift in times of such gravity.  Highly likely that he signs this exact way every time he signs - no matter who is watching. /v This guy loves his job. /v i farted awww /v Check this IRMA HURRICANE HUMOR ONE LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q04H0Z1L-zY /v  /v That Face !! /v The interpreter is awesome. What's his full name? Does anyone know? /v my 4 year daughter want to see this video again and again. More sucess than Disney's  Frozen. What is the name of this guy, i want his version of   Dunkerke and Star Wars. /v WTF did I just watch? How did the governor make it through his speech with that going on next to him? This guy reminds me of Mr. Bean. /v Thanks for signing the phone number so I can call and talk to....oh wait.. /v If you think that's funny, you should see the sign language guy for blind people! /v I don't know what's funnier, the mime guy or the gubner wearing a baseball cap. /v this just needs some beats.  /v He is the real deal and he is good.  He is a CDI.  I recently took a workshop he taught. To the untrained eye, his facial expressions are funny or weird.  But to native signers, those facial expressions are the most important part of the language.  They are the equivalent of vocal tone and punctuation.  Interpreting students have to learn these facial expressions.  It takes months -> years to learn this.  You want funny, you should see a class of new interpreters practicing facial expressions.  Also, there is a lot of work here.  The speaker, the off camera interpreter (who can hear) signing to him, so he can interpret the msg. and sign it in ASL. W/O facial expressions he's like a monotone speaker who says uh every other word.  Chinese sounds funny to me too, but that's because I don't know the language. /v Just like the global warming scam, this guy proves these deaf people have just been fucking with us all along.  *waves arms wildly* /v He was clearly mocking the governor, how can you guys not see that? /v Is the tongue really necessary /v This has to be some nut that pretended to be the sign language guy or whatever they are. This is like a SNL skit. There's no way this was real /v Is that real sign language or is this guy clowning around making gibberish? /v I am deaf. His expression is not funny, it is the expression of seriousness of the hurricane and he is signing in true ASL that covers all levels of communication of the deaf. There are level of communication that come within the culture where there are spectrum of deaf level of understanding. It appears whoever post this lacks understanding of the deaf culture and it's situation. I assume you are hearing and do understand that you see only the expression and not it's signs that are visual and representable to the context of the language and situation that is happening that could save the lives of the deaf community. I hope this provides an insight to change your title of the topic of the video. /v I think this is over the top. It distracts the viewer from listening to the important message given by the Governor. How can a serious message possibly be 'translated' by such weird facial expressions? His expressions don't seem to match the words. /v This guy should do stand ups!!! /v Iam sure he is just making it up lol /v Fake. /v Just watching his facial expressions and the noises he makes are too funny!! /v Austin which types of comments you mostly reply . do you reply any of the comment on youtube /v I am watching on an 80$ lg triibute and it is equaly as good as iphone5s /v When a 80$ phone has a headphone jack but a 500$+ phone doesn't?

Very unique, I guess that's probably why you do it. /v ...why would you take a fast photo of a celeb? So random. /v Hey guys this is austin and it's really exhausting. /v Do I the Mac mini is worth it /v I think Austin is working out /v Mg this rich dude should buy me a phone if he doesn't think $80 is alot  /v zuk z1 is much better for that price (I found it for $100) /v OMG!

I absolutely love the natural look! /v #shamelessfenty Love this look! This makeup would be absolutely perfect for me. I don't need the full coverage but I'm just beginning to play with makeup styles at 43  /v SHAMELESS!!!!! I'm ready to hear all your thoughts. /v I LOVE YOU SM MAYA and I remember when I went to girl talk and I meet you. It meant so much because I told you that you taught me how to be fearless because I was insecure about my finger. Shortly after that you gave me a hug and that made my whole entire year:) /v I don't wear makeup but man, Fenty makes me want to wear it /v I love all of your videos and I love Rihanna omg we island girls are winiing! /v Loved this look! Congrats on 1 million!!!! I almost cried for you when I saw it!!! God is so good /v I'm obsessed with this makeup line. I want to get so many things /v I love your reaction to her makeup. You are GLOWING with the products. Natural Beauty is the way to go. /v I don't even wear makeup like that, but I need this! /v Loved this look on you, you have an amazing skin! Since Fenty Beauty doesn't ship to where I live, i will love to have a chance to win this. Congrats on 1M /v We definitely have the same taste for makeup! I live for that natural caramel glow  /v So glad I got that foundation shade so beautiful. RIH KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING! /v Haha I was waiting in front of my computer JUST LIKE THAT  /v I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH /v First review I've seen!

This brand would be perfect for me because I don't really beat my face like that, I usually do a natural look, so I'm really hype to try this out! /v Maya i love you, and have been watching you since you started when you had your long beautiful curly hair. Absolutely love the new fenty collection riri out here slaying the game /v Oh wow! You look sooo freakin pretty! I love your look!!! This video was very nice and it represents Fenty Beauty very well!!! /v Congratulations Maya! You look stunning. I'm definitely loving the au natural look FENDY is bringing, xo, Sheyla /v Awesome job.. Thinking  of buying the trio.. cuz I don't have anything like that /v Love you Maya! You're the one YouTuber in my sub box that I relate to most- thank you for doing you!  /v Wow. I loved your review and this makeup made you look flawless. /v Love your video. Loved watching your excitement with each new product. /v hey Maya where you get those awesome tone colour backgrounds???\nor is that your wall lol?? plz answer /v This might bet THE best makeup line I've seen! So bronze and natural AND glam all in one! My kind of makeup! #shamelessfenty /v OMG I love these! That rum is amazing! /v #shamelessfenty LOVED this review. I bought product day 1 of the launch but think I need to go back and purchase a couple more items (at least try them on!) after watching this fab video. Thanks for the realness in your review! XOXO /v I am sold on Fenty Beauty; your makeup looks fabulous!!!! I'm headed out to Sephora to get mine. /v I love how HAM you went with Rum. I have that same trio and it's freaking great. The foundation isn't oxidizing, b/c the air isn't changing the color. It's wet and looks lighter, and then once it dries/sets it's the actually color. It doesn't change color as the day goes along. Once it's set, that's the color it's going to stay. /v the highlight looks so bomb /v I love your vids! And you are so gorgeous! /v That highlighter looks so pretty on you. Can't wait to try it out. /v The highlight blend on the eyes was a good idea. A lot of other reviews mentioned it was too yellow /v I have the foundation and primer. Probably gonna go back and get trophy wife when I get my coins right #ShamelessFenty /v Maya, you needed to apply more foundation. It is a buildable foundation so it can be worn light or full coverage. The primer you used could be the reason for the ashiness! That seems to be the case for the different primers that are being used. You still look BOMB /v Sooo beautiful. /v Broooo she gorg /v Dat gold thoooooo /v #shamelessfenty /v #shamelessfenty /v #shamelessfenty /v #shamelessfenty /v Love it! /v Love this collection /v Yassssss hunny slay!!!!! /v #shamelessFENTY /v <3 so exciteed tooo /v #shamelessfenty /v Yessss B  /v Loved this review! /v #ShamlessFenty  /v #shamelessfenty /v  /v Beautiful! Luv you boo! /v Serve my life Rihanna! #FentyMaya /v Popping  /v Giving me that Jada Pinkett Smith vibe!! YAAASSS MAYAA! YAAAASS!!! /v #shamelessfenty /v #shamelessfenty /v I'm sold!!! /v #ShamelessFenty Bronze goddess! /v #shamelessfenty /v #shamelessfenty /v Love it! /v #Shamelessfenty /v Congrats on 1 millyyy /v That lip gloss is everything! /v #ShamelessFenty /v The look overall looks absolutely flawless /v I love everything about fenty beauty omg /v Gorgeous! Love it /v Love love loveeee, I love you Maya  /v #shameless fenty /v #SHAMLESSFENTY /v cute... /v Fenty beauty #giveaway to me!!!  /v Very pretty makeup. Lightweight yet glamorous!  /v Pleaseeeeeeee! Do more makeup videos I loveeeeee themmmmmm /v #shamelessfenty /v #SHAMELESSFENTY /v I am *amazed* that none of that stuff was *stolen* . In the USA, it would be gone in *2-3 minutes* . Especially cellphones and labtops. /v Oh and another thing: just this morning I was taking the ferry to uni in Venice, sitting next to some Japanese people. They left for a moment, leaving on their seat their camera and their umbrella! They literally left their Nikon camera on an unattended seat, you don't do that in Italy  /v We do this in America too! Anything to show the place is not vacant. \nSometimes sure things get stolen, so people honestly don't stray too far, or for too long. \n\nBut people here do this too. Especially at universities where people expect thieving less.\n\nBIKES would be stolen though, especially in busy cities. /v I in the UK, and we don't do this, just in case someone thinks it is a bomb. This has been the case since the 80s so it is not totally new. I think the IRA did bomb this way but I could be wrong, you also find bins missing in some places for the same reason.\nNow I thought I share this things I seen to back this up a bit. Back when I was in school in 1997-8 or there abouts we had under 21 game in the city and someone left a foil wrapped sandwich in the toilet for us to have a nice bomb alert.  There also time in the early 200s when a old lady (I think she was Indian) found her suitcase was too heavy and just left it outside the bank so they closed half the city centre off for like 3 hours or so. \nAnd as another thought remember 7/7, that was done with bombs in backpacks.\n\nWith that as a background  imagine my fear and thinking to seeing  bags being left lying around in a USA bus station, where I seen it a few times, hell I did once. But my favourite thing was in Vancouver bus station when on being told not to leave my bag around, I said yes because you blow it up. The lady was kinda of scared by that answer I tell you and went no it might get stolen. /v is this what happens when you respect others and aren't spoiled and think the world owes you stuff? xD /v In the US we always take everything with us will getting food or leave behind someone to watch the table then return so they can go get food. But the US has higher crime rates so it's better to be cautious. /v I don't even leave my kids without having Line to Sight on them. /v It's the same in Singapore just that we use cheaper alternatives like tissue packet paper... /v Try that in the Philippines I dare you! You don't have to leave your valuables for it to be stolen from you. Or your life as well. #Pinoypride #reality /v Could do a video about bicycles in Japan? I just looked up bike jail and it sounds like a very Japanese concept. In a good way. I just heard on the news today that bike theft has gone up by more than 13% in my region as bikes get more expensive and people tend to report more. /v I've had my car broken into once. Luckily I did not leave any items of true personal value in the car that day. The thief/thieves must have been pissed caused they grab every pointless thing in the car.  They were so desperate they even took my spare tire in the trunk...joke was on them though, that tire has been flat for weeks...LOL!!!!!!! I would love to have seen their faces when they found out. LOL!!! /v In Canada i cover the chair in my signature maple syrup to ensure noone sits in my seat but most people just walk right by when they see my beaver on the table /v In Singapore we mainly use packets of tissue paper or namecards! /v In my city, those belongings are definitely gone in minutes! /v In my country if you leave your phone or anything on the table and go for 1 minute it will disappear like magic /v In Poland (and probbably in most other countries) it is common to save your spot by putting a shirt or a coat, an umbrella or a bag. Yet you should not leave any valuables (also in said bag) as they might get stolen. Also, the things that you leave still do not grant you that you will keep that seat as others may relocate your stuff to a different free spot that may not be as great as the previous one (views for example). /v Its awsome that they dont ask to subscribe at the end of the video!! /v In my part of the world , they have a saying : \n Gear adrift is a gift .... \n\nAnything left laying about will go missing almost immediately . \n\nYou are careful about showing valuable items when using them ... someone might rob you . \nEspecially high-dollar items like expensive watches , jewelry , cellphones , laptops , etc . \n\nYou never leave children unattended , as kids come up missing all the time . \nHeck , adults get kidnapped and held for ransom or murdered here . \nDrug cartel members have gun-battles on the streets . \n\n You keep a close eye on everyone around you . \n\nI have thwarted a couple of robberies simply by being aware and prepared . \nAvoiding being caught in what was an obvious set-up . \n\nScammers , thieves and robbers are a simple fact of life . \nYou watch for them like you would dangerous animals  , or poisonous spiders and snakes when out in the wilderness . \nThe wilderness is actually safer , and I spend a good bit of time out there . \n\nI've had tools and things stolen out of the back of my truck , and my house broken into . \n\nYou have to lock everything , all the time . \nI can't imagine living somewhere so urbane . \nTo us it seems careless . \n\nAnd no , you don't get to reserve a seat before you order . \nYou order , then find a place to sit , if alone . \nIf you are with someone , they hold a spot , with your gear , while you order for everyone . \nEven then , you watch out for each other . \n\nTrouble can start at any moment when you are out in public . \nYou have to be ready to grab your gear , and fight your way to safety , at any time . \nCertain groups thrive on causing trouble , it's entertainment for them . \nYour gear becomes their gear , if you lay it down , or they can take it from you . /v I kinda want to live in japan just for this... But I hate winter. /v I piss on the spot i want...my dog taught me that trick /v Lmao this is what we do in our school (though it's kind of dangerous to do this outside the school) /v In Singapore we leave a packet of tissue on the table. Anything else will probably be stolen or deemed as forgotten items. /v The lesson here folks is by all means, leave your valuables to save your spot in Japan. In fact, the more valuable, the better. That's why I always leave my kids to save mine. \nLOL /v This is why I love the idea of moving to Japan. It is the antithesis of where I live, quite genuinely and I need to be in that kind of environment after all these years. /v life would be complicated for the foodicted like me but love For Japan for their simplicity. /v I do the same here in UAE, never had an issue but I think its a bad habit /v I'm  sorry  but I think  saving  spots is rude on it self and unfair to others, unless a person is wanting  there I'd be ok with it. /v I'm natives american. From Minnesota. On our tribe you will find many tight knit families and close friends. Recent economic growth has led to entire streets of house's being reserved for one family with a common name. We are close knit. At event's the best seats are reserved for the elderly and accomplished. Besides that we share so well nobody would hold a thought that was stingy or aggressive. It's more about the activity.:) /v In South Africa, don't leave anything anywhere, it will be  gone in 5minutes. Also saving a spot is heavily frowned upon. /v I'd rob them /v That last line xD;;; /v in oldham you either do the same or have a m8 sit there and you auder there 4 therm /v How do you save your spot where you're from? ROFL! /v Probably because Japan has a 95% conviction rate and harsh environments in prison. /v In the US if you leave your stuff it gets stolen or someone argues with you saying you cant save seats like that or will probably push your stuff off the table. Lol /v we do it in turkey too :) /v in NYC, there would have been 10 cops with the bomb squad. we don't mess with unattended bags haha /v Beware if you see a small pack of tissue in Singapore food court table. /v Usually when I'm with friends or family whomever gets their drink first is tasked with finding a spot for the group. Not sure if ordering is the same elsewhere, but once everyone has a drink we sit and wait for the food. /v I also do that here in our country Philippines but I make sure that i only leave a less valuable thing in the table and look whose nearby my seat so if anything happens or if my things got stolen i know who to blame  /v Unfortunately, I think the video is sending a wrong message. Although Japan is considered to be generally safe, thieves do exist and I know people who had their bikes stolen multiple times. So no matter how safe a place are, it's your own responsibilities to take care of your valuables. /v Here in the USA......it would be gone .....even if you turn your head!    But in church ......no I can safely hold my seat with my jacket! /v Only Tokyo in Japan. Other cities in Japan are more relaxing. /v In america you dont /v We do this in the Philippines... but before you know it, it's gone. lol\nSo yeah... Japan... you seriously have the most disciplined people in the World. TBH /v I once saw a lone WALLET save a seat at a restaurant in McDonalds. Really? The literal EASIEST thing to steal and you choose it? /v We leave a bag or something ...I'm sure a smartphone or a laptop would be snatched up rather quickly /v Unfortunately since 9/11 if u leave bags around unattended for a while in Australia they may get reported to security or police because of bomb threats. Not that we have much of a problem in Australia with terrorists. \nI wouldn't leave my valuables to save a seat, better to b safe than sorry! /v Love the girls shirt at 4:00 /v In America you would never leave anything valuable unattended. It would get stolen in minutes. You would put your soda and napkins in the table. I love your video's. They are very informative. /v Lol. We also do that in the Philippines /v In Portugal, if you're with friends, someone sits at the table while others get food. If you're alone though, you're out of luck. /v I got four minutes of my life stolen by watching this video, maybe the next video could be on Japanese immigration policy? /v In Poland you'd have to leave behind a person, preferably someone difficult to move. /v Well.when I try to save my spot at school people move my stuff /v that's why i always leave my kids to save mine LOL /v I noticed a lot of Japanese men are wearing Fanny packs these days. Just not around their belt, but like a mini, one strap backpack /v It's the same in Singapore! They call it 'chope'. However if you do it in Indonesia, your stuff will magically gone in a few seconds lol /v Warning: Dont try this in New York /v How does someone forget to ride there bike home?  Is it just me or is that weird? /v My parents will either leave me and my sisters or our coats.  Sometimes I have to take off my shoes just save seats :/ /v by leaving your friend alone on the spot /v We sit on the spot to save it in Bangladesh /v In the USA if you leave your stuff anywhere be prepared it will be taken that is unless someone so kind with a good heart will return it to where someone can retrieve it easily. One day I was at a mall where I left my bag with two items I bought and thinking someone would return it to lost and found but apparently it was take so I had to rebuy. What I do is when I am alone I don't ever save seats because its pointless however if I am with someone then I have that person save us a seat while I take orders for both of us if its take out or if its order in than me and the person I am with whether it is with my hubby friend or family will take turns to use restroom. /v There is no such thing as, saving your spot in Los Angeles XD So sad /v Just because you can have faith in a chair doesn't mean you should jump up and down on it.\nCAN you use your wallet to save your space? Probably. Should you? No.\nEven if the Japanese were 100% trustworthy- and they are not, there are millions of foreign tourists there every year. Just because Japan is extremely safe doesn't mean it is 100% safe.\nLiving there for years, I became aware of some incidents of theft. However, I will always say that Japan is a great place to travel solo, as crime is extremely minimal. You can use backpacks or bags behind you without any real fear if being ripped off. You don't have to worry about someone rummaging in your bags while you get your wallet to pay. If you ask someone for directions, or look at a map, or otherwise be distracted, you are extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of. But you're still not 100% safe. Don't tempt fate. /v Holy cow. \n#41 on trending. \nWay to go Greg. /v What a blessing it is that you live in such a safe place!!!! I could never save a seat with my belongings. :( A great eye opening vid. Keep it coming!!! /v So basically what you're saying is Japan is the best country to steal stuff /v Some people in my country use their car keys /v We save spot in America with our NON valuables.... lol /v We do the same thing in Canada. I live on the east coast. /v Did you actually recorded dog poo? 3:08 /v In korea and japan, you can leave your wallet, purse, or cellphone on the side walk and no one will even touch it.\nThen, they go to US and get robbed at gun point. /v I move   the stuff and put it on another table. If people are not there then too bad. You lose the spot. One of the things I find really irritating about Japan. /v You take the whole chair where im from /v 3:17 That scene transition looked like your daughter was your wife... lol. /v Try to do it in the U.S and I guarantee when you come back your things aren't gonna be there /v We leave a person in London, UK everything would be stolen. /v I've often noticed how similarly priced Japan is compared to the Netherlands. Price to get your bike from a bicycle depository after the municipality had it removed? 22.50 or 2 925.60 at the current exchange rates :o\n\nIt's not just leaving stuff behind to save seats, you can safely leave your stuff unattended for a while. When I arrived in Japan my friend and I went to the shopping centre under Tokyo Station and because there was so little space in the shops themselves, we left our bags near the entrance as much out of the way as we could so we wouldn't be a bother to other people while browsing. /v So Japan is so safe, police have enough time to just sit there and spy on a bait? /v Wait, why am I watching this? I can't afford going to Japan. /v I accidentally left my hat on a train station. I have to ride back to the said station to get it at station office. Speaking little Japanese, good thing I've got a selfie of me with the said hat on my phone, making of retrieving it easier. Everyone at the station are so helpful and kind.:) /v I went shopping in kyoto and left my video camera and gimbal at checkout.  It was 20 mins later that i realised it was missing and rushed back to find it still sitting there.\n\nI love japan!! /v Japan have the lowest crime of all cities in the world /v This happens in my school's library /v Do any of your kids see hachisakama plz I am so srry if they get scared Google it /v Japanese tourists even do this in Hawaii. I saw this in a Waikiki food court, so I did it too. Mainland there is no way I would leave valuables at a table. Sometimes in a smaller place like a Starbucks, I will leave a jacket. /v  /v Nice shirt /v With packs of tissue wipes.  /v  /v Bike Jail! lol /v davao too /v What is Burakumin? /v Ahhh typical dad joke. Laughed though so whatever- /v  /v  /v In USA you go with more then one person. One person sits and saves the spot while other gets food, goes to restroom or whatever. If you are by yourself....you don't save your spot. When you get up you lose it. /v This makes me want to move to Japan. /v next video: food you can make while driving /v Thank you from Florida! This was very thoughtful for everyone in need!  /v I can make a sandwich or a salad with no power? *mind explodes* /v So many catchphrases /v In the next video: How to watch youtube videos with no power. /v Could have torched the cheese on the pizza. But a lot of those things need refrigeration like mayo, cheese and butter and most stores do not have even those foods once the storm hits.........no electricity. /v CRAZY TAGGLER!!! /v MAKE A FIYRE /v Don't lie /v  /v barf inducing /v Thank you! /v Shit was week /v Thank you /v Thanks bros! /v we need camera,.thumbs down /v Great advice /v you're awesome dude!!!! <3 God bless you /v Watching just for being lazy /v I didn't tap on any YouTuber's who had anything to say about the hurricane I'm living through I felt most was just hopping on what was trending! But I said self not him self said hummmmm so I tapped on YOU! Thank you you really care! /v I'm from Saint-Martin, living in France and still haven't hear from my family. Thanks for this vid, love ALL your vids.. /v Awesome video. Thank you! /v This video reminds me of my friend Thomas and our drunken college days. He would raid my cabinet and make a delicious meal with the random ingredients I had on hand. /v Don't suggest the Mayo. If they don't have power then the last thing you want is spoiled mayo that hasn't been refrigerated or the power had been out for a few days.  J/s /v and congrats to your bro on the wedding! /v I had a hard time understanding how you'd be unable to cook without power. Then it hit me, electric powered stoves. I've always used gas fueled stoves my whole life so even when storms cut off power, i can still cook. /v I have a silly question. How will they watch the video with no power? /v Sometimes I watch these videos and wonder if the target audience is high, and other times I find myself asking how I never thought of that /v How is someone in Cali meant to see this lol do they just have wifi hotspots set up in the eye of the storm along with free wireless charging /v where u from in north Carolina /v Just went through Irma yesterday and we ate good. Ice cream Sunday, steak sandwiches cooked in propane. And damm you can't forget the home made wine. /v The second repice is very similar to that one which i learned from my uncle. You're cooking a pasta then when it's ready add some cane fish and some other things u have in the fridge like vegetables, mustard, ketchup if u like and u can eat it warm or just put it in a fridge and eat it later.\nBe safe and have a good one guys! /v God bless you! tip: umeboshi was widely used in old Japan in bento boxes to make the food last longer, so day one cooked protein and more will last you up to 20 hrs if you put several umeboshi in a box with it /v How are they supposed to watch this if they don't have power? /v just the other day some guy in an alley came up to me and told me I had to try these sardines. Then he reached into his pants so I walked away /v Did they both move out of New York? /v I wanted to say thank you for this vid, from the bottom of my heart. Sent to Mom in FL. She thanks you as well  /v Rofl. He moves his body as much as a rapper. Looks like he's dancing. Watch from 0:16 and for like 10 seconds. xD! /v How should I say , your channel it's just like cooking version of hacking. Keep up the work. /v How will they see the vid with no power /v My thought's and prayers going out to everyone affected by Hurricane Irma. My heart goes out to you all. Please be safe and careful. I'm thinking of everyone right now. Love to you all. <3 /v Things you can do in your car in traffic: pulls out a blowtorch. /v It's not meant to be fancy food. The food may look awkward, but it's not about how the food looks, it's about using your mind and what you have and use the best of it. In a bad situation people need to come together and try to comfort each other in the best way possible, ever if you make a meal with whatever you have. This guy has a good heart and good intentions /v Awesome stuff but man we will not be crazy like that in the event of a hurricane /v was that a bobo bar in the oatmeal alternative? /v This guy is hungry /v Thank you so much for this video! I looked on google the last few day and couldn't find anything this concise. I'm in Gainesville so the severity of Irma and how long we will be without power is unknown. We are about to get the worst in the next few hours and it's so nice to have some yummy recipes to look forward to that we can make without power. /v Just a little too soon brah? I don't think evacuees are concerned about cooking.  /v How do I cook with no power during an earthquake? /v How am I suppose to watch this with no power? /v Thank you. The first YT to acknowledge this major disaster (in my feed).  /v Food is definitely comforting. We had a fire that destroyed my kitchen and left toxic smoke everywhere and had to evacuate. Fortunately my insurance paid for a hotel. We got a suite with a teeny kitchen. My mother in law was with us and we went to a store to get supplies. We all went off in different directions and got stuff and we ALL came back with baskets filled with comfort food. Mac n Cheese, White bread, peanut butter puddings etc. It helped us through the first few awful days. /v Cooking implies heat is involved. Instead you prepared a piece of bread with debris on it. /v if there is no power now hiw the hell they will see this video /v Hahaha welcome to the amazing world of PRISON FOOD lmao.. and Im not being a hater. Im just saying this is the kind of crap prisoners have to endure all the time #empathy /v Anyone who tells you to refrigerate an uncut tomato is wrong and I don't trust them. /v sardine world 1/3 of the plot of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs /v Usefull ! I'm actually having a kitchen makeover so no oven no refrigerator ! /v Pause and be grateful because I have something 100% accurate! Love your videos. I've been without power for almost 20 hours and I really appreciate this video! /v Thanks for the suggestions.  I've pretty much batched cooked some items that we could eat cold to be prepared for the power outages in Atlanta GA.    I'm vegetarian and my son eats everything. /v Upload some more how to eat food with no food fam (   ) /v I wish this would have came out when the stores where open /v Massive respect to you from England. USA vs Hurricane you guys normally win everything else! Good luck out there. /v now this is what we call profting off of tragedy.\n\nHOW TO COOK WITH NO POWER. USE GAS CAMP STOVES. MAKE A SANDWICH.\n\nThanks youtube guy /v Hi from Tampa Florida. About to lose power soon. Thanks for the comforting video. I made sure to stock up on food and water. /v I had to pause your video to make the tuna dip and it's REALLY good. I would never have thought to add what you added, nor would I have thought to eat it with tortilla chips. \nThis is why I love you guys!! New AMAZING ideas. /v Excellent idea to make this video! Very thoughtful /v And here I'm sitting in Tampa ready to eat cold beans straight from a can ;) Thanks for the ideas!! /v I live in Ohio  /v THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS VIDEO!! I'm from florida and this will be very helpful especially when the electricity is out /v josh is a in colorado now :,( props to you though Josh. we love you and that seems like the perfect place for your zen lifestyle /v I just love your whole attitude /v This is so incredibly considerate. I recently subscribed to you guys, and I've never been happier with a subscription. Honestly, you two seem like the best. All the love to you for this, and to those being affected by Irma. Stay safe, everyone! /v Whats up with your arms are you itchy? /v You are so thoughtful to make this video. /v Watching while having my probably last hot coffee for a few days /v As a Floridian, thank you so much for doing this. This is not only helpful, but it's such a kind gesture. You are rad! /v Music in video??? Anyone? /v Thank you for doing this, very thoughtful. /v I'd love to smoke a joint with you. /v Only thing is by the time this was posted,  the stores already closed. So this might be more beneficial for other Hurricanes as opposed to Irma /v You look like you literally just rolled out of bed in this video lol /v Thank you for the love /v love this thank you <3 /v Im from sw florida and its just starting here. if i werent stuck at work the entire time this would be major help for me! Thank you on behalf of my state  /v For mayo/ miracle whip/salad dressing Dollar Tree makes little jars. You could either buy before storms or buy & occasionally use them bc they have a couple of months self life. I think this video was an awesome way of showing support! /v i love how the background and his dressing is so appropriate for the theme of this video #attentiontodetail /v How do people who dont have power watch this. /v wtf is with all that random sht in the background?   XD /v I live in The Netherlands and this video made me tear up.. i can't believe what is going on in the world right now. Best wishes to everyone in this rough time.. and thank you so much for this amazing video you uploaded. I knew that you were a very kind person /v Hey. I used to live in St.Martin and have loads of friends who survived  Irma. Trust me they don't need to cook there these days. Food is not what they worry about most. These people are not stupid. There are so many easily available kinds of food that don't need cooking or power to prepare. You Americans can only microwave stuff so you die without power. /v did he say he moved to Denver??? /v Really great tips and thanks for sharing your stories. I always enjoy your uploads. /v I live in California and we're just watching in horror what is happening in Florida and Texas! This is craziness... and then that freakin huge ass earthquake hits Mexico!??  /v How do you watch this video without power? /v Thanks to hurricane Irma I am with out electricity since Wednesdayso thank you for your video much love from Puerto Rico  /v I have been so stressed about losing power and had a hard time finding how we would eat if we do. Of course we have canned foods and bread but I didn't know how to make full meals with what we have. Thank you for this video and your thoughtfulness. Much love from Florida. /v People need to understand thy even after the hurricane has passed ppl might be without power for a while ... the way it looks is the last thing ppl will care about .. nutrition, nourishment is most important. These are easy recipes.. that ppl can make. Good video /v How r u supposed to watch this without power. Power = WIFI!!!! /v I have a good tuna salad & some other ideas... I am just hoping this helps someone. I'm sure there's a TON of people on here who have family in FL, I know I do. My tuna salad goes great on any kind of cracker, bread, in a tomato, lettuce, or wrap. Especially for people trying to stretch a meal while packing in a lot of vitamins or just use up veggies. The majority of these things will last out of the fridge and even though there is quite a bit of prep, it's totally worth it. You can even just throw all of it on a sandwich in a pinch and get the same flavor. \n\nI came up with this about a year ago when my husband and I were down on our luck and I was trying to pack a bunch of nutrition, & bulk into an affordable meal.\n\nAnyways, I normally use 2-3 cans of tuna, if you only have 1 can, just use that! I've done it before, and it still worked perfectly. My cats usually get part of the can. It's also another way to feed your pets if you need to. Lol So I hit the drained tuna immediately with the juice of 1 lemon. If you don't have lemon, use red wine or some other kind of vinegar. Then add 1/2 - 1Chopped red onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1 seeded chopped tomato or a handful of cherry/grape tomatoes, both sweet & kosher dill pickles chopped, or relish, S&P everything and add a touch of mayo. You could even omit the Mayo if you wanted. The veggies and the lemon juice add enough moisture which cuts back on the amount of mayo needed. The acid from the lemon cuts through the fishyness as well. I have also added celery to this and have topped it with provolone. Could be a great vegg friendly item for people who don't like to eat tuna.\n\nAnother great idea with tuna and or leftover pasta. You can always make tuna salad for 1 day or meal, then make a pasta salad the next. If you cooked a couple days prior to your power being knocked out, it's possible that you already have cooked pasta. If you have frozen peas, add those in with a simple tuna salad made with something along the lines of tuna, lemon juice and zest or vinegar, red onion, and dill weed, or dill pickles. It's another way to stretch something you've already made or use up something you have already. \nThis pasta salad can go so many different directions. You could do a Greek or Italian style, cold/room temp pasta salad with different cheeses, deli meats and veggies. Adding things like spinach to bulk it up. If you add cheese, you should eat it asap obviously.\nYou could even do a veggie wrap with peanut sauce... /v Just came off a flight from London to Guangzhou near where I live, and... yeah.\nI got on at midday, then had the whole day on the plane essentially, then right as the day was ending, the sun came up and we started again.\nThat 8 hours of sleep we're supposed to get vanished into that hole called time difference.\nAdd to that the fact that I went from a place where the sun was setting at 10pm to a place where it sets at 6pm and yep, my brain's messed up. /v You are so cute! /v Love how carefree this travel vlog felt! Way to stay up late to avoid jet lag!! It is always harder travelling West, so you'll have it easy on the return flight :D /v all i could think about after about 1:15 is what is airport simulator and how do i play it???!! /v 2:56 you can literally see my apartment. So, you know, if you want to come by for cake, that's totally OK. /v that last bit isn't silly, hank! either that or were both silly XD I like walking on the actual dirt or grass or just land off new places I go. I dont want to just walk on the cement and man-made things, but the actual earth of wherever I go. /v Watching One Punch Man is always the right choice. /v Hello, beautiful chocolate. I'm sorry. /v So, in like a two week holiday, how likely would it be to encounter a spider larger than an inch in diameter in Sydney? Only asking because if I did, that would be the only thing I'd remember from Australia for the rest of my life. /v Welcome to here! Hope you're enjoying it :D I used to work 5 minutes from where you're staying. Now I'm 15 minutes away and missed my opportunity to glance a Green. Booo :P /v I hope all is well over there in Montana man. Those fires are crazy. Stay safe and great video brother!! /v This is such an accurate portrayal of my flying north america to australia monologues. lol /v Not gonna lie, the title how to win Australia made me believe this was going to have something to do with the game risk. /v Welcome to Melbourne! I hope you can take some time to go to the South Melbourne Market, Chez Dre, and Bibelot! /v It's interesting that you brought that up Hank, because that's pretty much exactly what's been in my head upon meeting you on Sunday.  I'm not sure that you remember me, but I was the Asian girl in the red beanie, the blue hair, I had a face full of makeup, puffy jumper and healed boots. Now already, I can feel the judgement/ analysis of the type of person you (the reader) think that I am... And that's okay, because it's human nature. It protects you from imminent danger and whatnot. The way I presented myself that day is not exactly what you would call the 'typical nerdfighter' image. It makes me wonder how different your perception of me would have been if I had my glasses on, I'd worn a hoody, and I'd come up to you barefaced (and here I am stereotyping the typical geek or nerd -.- see we all do it). Don't get me wrong Hank, you were lovely, but when you looked at me for the first time it was a look of suprise almost. Idk maybe that's just how I read it. It suddenly kicked in that you had no idea who I was, yet I knew so much about you (your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, your intellect, your status etc etc) and I can only imagine how hard it would be to be meeting all these strangers, hundreds in a row, and being nice to them and trying to make them feel welcome. I realised that your perception of me would be purely based upon this 60 second time frame. (In which those 60 seconds I freaked out, ran up and hugged you, acted like a complete fangirl and said exactly the things I had decided not to say to u when waiting in the line haha). But I feel as if we have this programming inside our minds that automatically works to act a certain way towards people depending on the type of person we perceive them to be or by how safe we feel in their presence. Its not a bad thing. It's just human nature and it protects us. But man, on the other hand, this is exactly the reason why some people are so self conscious and so insecure about what they look like (I know I definitely struggle with that on the regular.. Because I WANT to dress how I want, i want to be able to have fun with what I wear and make up my face so that if u made a collage of my face each day, it would be like a fluid mosaic) We can't stop the judgement, because it is innate, but we can go into meeting a new person with an open mind. I just think its an interesting topic...but I mean, socialising is harddd. Probability of u reading this: probably zero. But worth a shot anyway :) /v Ahhhhhhh!!!  Welcome to my city! /v MOUNTAINS! More like NOTHINGS. /v Who's that blonde woman at the bar? /v Good job watching One Punch Man.\n\nPlease talk about it on the podcast. I feel the discussion would better the less John knows about it. /v Ahh that sounds wonderful! I would love to go to Australia someday. My sister studied abroad there! /v NOOOOO HE USED AN O BIKE /v I'm a little confused by the sudden guest appearance of Hank's feet /v Thank you for pronouncing it Mel-bern, not Mel-born. \nI miss my home. I live in the UK now. Thank you for the shots of my favourite city. /v Wow, I didn't realise Melbourne skyline could make me so happy/homesick. I hope you enjoyed or are continuing to enjoy some excellent Aussie hospitality. Love from London x /v I've been to a nerdfighter gathering where we sat on that hill!! So weird... /v So, so, so expensive to fly to Australia, $1,200. I'll just fly to Thailand for half that and likely I'll find as many Australians there. /v Welcome to my Island, I hope you enjoy your time here. /v I have that same shirt! /v I totally wore those same socks this week. /v <a target=_blank href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GEW27DA?tag=doowanwest198-20&ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1504743295417&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&linkId=78c280dcf52ef99dbcfab24bde8de473>Shop Amazon - Save up to $25 on Amazon Fire tablets - Exclusively for Prime Members</a><img src=//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=doowanwest198-20&l=pf4&o=1 width=1 height=1 border=0 alt= style=border:none !important; margin:0px !important; /> /v What's with the foot thing at the end? /v Even though I'm still ~800kms away from Melbourne, just that he is in Australia, and a city I've been to many times. \nIt feels so much more personal. /v Brought to you by United Airlines! /v Low-pass audio filter is your friend Hank. You can filter out that high pitch noise using a low-pass (lower frequencies pass through) audio filter. /v My annual summer marathon of Vlogbrother videos once again comes to an end...in September. Yeah, there's a lot of these now. \n\nStill good though! Although there's a lot of death in the later years, I must say. I mean, the videos are also much, MUCH more positive and optimistic overall and about the future as we go along but there's also a lot more discussion on mortality and growing older, as well as actual death (both good news, like how less people are dying now which is great and also the many horrible ways in which living things are dying...and Lemon).\n\nI think the channel is still great and perhaps more importantly, still greatly loved. The Green Brothers may be older, John may be greyer and Hank may have a sexy haircut now but it seems like they are happier and better people than they were at the start of the project and so too are we. \n\nI feel like Nerdfighteria needs a poem, like the Sherlock Fandom does, to encapsulate the wonder of it all, y'know? 221B is a great poem for the latter series and fandom. We need one too. /v I thought he was going to do a video on how Australians can win marriage equality... /v Do they still have that old amusement park on the waterfront, St Kilda's I think? /v 3:38 Can't tell if lighting, tight shoes, sunburn, or vitiligo. /v That success KILLED ME /v hope u have the best time down here!! actually breaks my heart that i can't come by and see u /v Nice shot of the southern hemisphere of Hank's body towards the end. /v Just a couple seconds of Hank foot massaging Australia /v He didn't fall off. /v It's really weird seeing my home town in a vlogbrothers video, heheh /v I can see the building where I work! /v When one of the founders of vlogging does a Neistat style vlog. :thinking: /v It was bit freaky to see my dad's office building in one of the shots and to think that you've also seen it. Feels so odd whenever people I admire are in Melbourne and have seen the same sights I have, yet, it somehow brings greater unity. /v I hope I get to the southern hemisphere before I die. /v I'm going to Australia in thREE WEEKS ................... /v I hope you enjoy the Melbourne weather (every season within a two hour time span) /v I'm from the northern hemisphere (Germany) and currently in the southern hemisphere (Peru) and you just gave me a wonderful thing to do, Hank! I'll definetely do the barefoot thing! /v The sunlight is beautiful and also evil. Beware the sunlight and check the UV index.\n\nWelcome to Melbourne. Also, VB is gross. /v NO FAIR I HAVE FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA AND CAN'T EVER SEEM TO GO /v I know just by looking at someone if they are going to put me in a category. /v I'm guessing it's just generic, uncopyrighted music, but I couldn't help but be reminded of Armoured Skeptic. /v I swear there's mountains over there somewhere.\n\nYeah, not looking forward to that haze hanging around the northwest US for the next few weeks. Regards from Boise. /v Hank, I really loved that quiet feet-in-grass moment at the end there. There are too few moments that I stop and appreciate such quiet, subtle joys, and even fewer of those when the joy belongs to somebody else. So thank you for the moment, it made me feel. /v Aww, you are making me miss my home town!  Have a great time in Melbourne!! /v I'm so envious of my friends who flew from NZ to be apart of vid con Australia. Have fun! /v I do the same thing at airports, but instead I'll give in to imagination knowing that any info i make up is probably off base, and make intricate plot lines using people's faces /v When Hank uses the same music that Armored Skeptic uses in his intros... there's a hint of irony somewhere in there. /v could you make a video about maturity? how to be mature etc? /v I really like this style of vid /v Staring at people in an airport....what a creeper. Jk /v While you're in Melbourne, swing by Mrk if you can. They do amazing hot chocolates.\n\nOh, and the Aardman exhibit is on at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. You have to see that! /v Welcome to my town. Hope you enjoy your stay /v I thought this was gonna be about Risk /v Idk if your parents are still living in Florida, but I hope they're okay!! And I hope their home is okay! /v I don't really do it as you describe it. I usually just judge whether I like their outfit or not. Maybe if a group of people belong together and think what their relationship could be. Or they remind me of someone which makes me think of that someone. /v I'm so heartbroken that you're in Melbourne and I'm stuck in Perth :(((( /v 1:16 what game is that? /v I really appreciate how good Hank's pronunciation of Melbourne is /v Lol, oh how to win AT Australia, or perhaps how to win OVER Australia (by being as cute and charming as Hank).\n\nI clicked hoping it would be advice to Australia on how to win. /v All of these travel videos have really opened my eyes in several ways and made me realize how much I love travelling... and why. Thank you to the both of you for making me laugh, educating me, and enabling me to live my best life. <3 ~Abby /v Hank, how great is Australia!? I'll let you in on an Australian secret, the best-est and most great-est place in Australia, objectively, is the Northern Territory. AND if you ever felt the urge to visit the prettiest and least populated part of Australia, I know a born and raised territorian who just happens to be an enthusiastic nerdfirghter who would give you a tour for a very speacial price ($0.00!) (ps it's me) /v Oh no! Now we will see Hanks feed on a foot fetish side  /v 'drops his VB'. Yeah. I'd do that too, and grab a Coopers' instead. Next time, mate. Next time. /v OMG y is hank at gay hill? 3:24 /v It was by a miraculous feat that you managed to get sun, in this weather, hot enough to melt your chocolate . Either that table was a heat mat mistaken for a table or you somehow concentrated all of the sun available to the  city onto your chocolate bar and quickly take a video before it reset. /v One punch man good choice /v Vacation by Rita Dove, 1952\n\nI love the hour before takeoff,\nthat stretch of no time, no home\nbut the gray vinyl seats linked like\nunfolding paper dolls. Soon we shall\nbe summoned to the gate, soon enough\ntherell be the clumsy procedure of row numbers\nand perforated stubsbut for now\nI can look at these ragtag nuclear families\nwith their cooing and bickering\nor the heeled bachelorette trying\nto ignore a babys wail and the babys\nexhausted mother waiting to be called up early\nwhile the athlete, one monstrous hand\nasleep on his duffel bag, listens,\nperched like a seal trained for the plunge.\nEven the lone executive\nwho has wandered this far into summer\nwith his lasered itinerary, briefcase\nknocking his kneeseven he\nhas worked for the pleasure of bearing\nno more than a scrap of himself\ninto this hall.

I find it hard to find my skin tone but it's just for everyday use  this review helped me soo much /v Your such a doll. So fun to watch. Hilarious. Werk it girl. /v Hi just wanted to pass along some information I learned. The Riri sponge absorbs more product than the beauty blender. That is why you used so much. And you should buy the Riri brush the foundation will apply better and use less products still. Love your channel  /v I have seen a lot of Fenty Beauty reviews recently and for some reason or another, this makeup brand seems to look better on people with medium/dark skin tones. Personally, I think the Trophy Wife highlight is too dark for fair/light skin tones. Or is it just me??? Ms Deb Deb, this review was fantastic and you make Trophy Wife look STUNNING! /v I loved your review and your accent \nI'm headed to Ireland in a few days and was hoping to pick up some of the collection while I'm on Holiday :) /v I had to follow you after you said  bitch I'm  440  /v I have joined the deb deb family, I love your accent /v Wow!!

Riri killed it for the sistas. /v You get the fullest coverage when you use the beauty blender dry and put foundation in the Palm of your hand to warm it up . It makes it go on smoother . /v ''If you use fenty beauty and you don't find husband please come and email me directly'' LOOOOOL /v Seeing you excited while applying make up makes me happy for rihanna.

Pretty girls don't need make up!!! /v Bannon is great. I hope he stays in touch with Trump /v Bannon is about to wake up a lot of liberals tonight. /v I'm voting for either President Trump or Mr. Steve Bannon in 2020 if he is going to run.  I strongly believe the educated Asian Americans like myself will do the same. /v OH MY GOD! He just cited my favorite line in The Wild Bunch I love this guy! /v Quite pleased this guy got the axe. What a poisonous individual. /v Its funny how the people against Trump keep getting smaller and smaller and drifting into obscurity /v worst thing about him is wearing 2 shirts. wtf? /v The more I hear this guy talk, the more I like him. I actually think it might help Trump and his agenda if he (Bannon) is on the outside calling it like it is. Time will tell. /v I heard he is slated to be the sexiest man alive 2018! /v Charlie Rose has aged, damn. Slurs words. Looks ready for a home, how sad. /v he sound he has accent. /v Bannon should be president, not Trump.\nJust being honest, don't hate me. /v So basically washington isn't a swamp, it's a cesspool! A city full of oath breaking traitors! /v This is the man who had our presidents ear? Seriously? Wow. /v I've seen preschoolers come up with better excuses and better points than this....who is this guy? /v Another prime example of the master race.... /v Politicians fear the media, which viciously attacks and dishonestly smears candidates who don't do what the media wants them to do. Most politicians soften, back down, and appease. The American people have been watching this in anger for years. The media represents the interests of the globalist elite, not the interests of the American people. Trump fought back, and that's why the American people forgave him for a multitude of sins. /v Nice photoshop of Bannon .... CBS u corrupt Sodomites whos sons burn with lust for men /v He isnt being loyal to TrumF these guys are both Scumbags , he is just saying this so TrumF wont crush him . He is just going to get TrumF in the dark like the Weasel he is /v This guy looks plain evil but man, he's a great political strategist. /v George Clooney is a hypocrite.  Go Steve. /v The Access Hollywood tape did have one positive effect: it lead to the jettisoning of Chris Christie. /v I am not media and I am not even an American, but that locker room talk left an indent on my mind on how a US president view women. You can call it what ever you want, at the end of the day, that was a married man talking about groping a married women - yet some just want to dismiss it as nothing! That speaks volume about the character of a man at hand (Trump). /v Bannon is spot on. I'm so glad this guyband Trump are friends. /v People reflected back to what Clinton did to women! /v bannon people do care you stupid racist trump lost the popular vote and he is the most unpopular president in history he is one reason the electoral college  should go /v Its no wonder America & that whole WORLD want him DEAD...... /v I must say, I am disappointed. Though I am not surprised, he isn't any brighter than the idiot president. Demagogue, in the flesh. /v Many of the things Steve says are exaggerations, armchair quarterbacking, or provably false. I do however agree with his assertion that China is in an economic war with the US while we sit back like idiots. /v What the establishment media keep trying to impress upon people is an emphasis on the idea of condoning groping women. What Bannon is focusing on is that in order to beat back the establishment, including those on the right/GOP, you have to not fall for the billy bush trap, you have to move forward and keep going. That in order to fix crisis you need not get buried in these assume the worst scenarios that do nothing but serve to defend the establishment through their media outlets pretending they care about anything but securing theirselves a position of power. And they'll use your social awareness as a weapon against anyone to achieve it when they could care less as long as the govt positions are secured. /v You can hate him but you gotta admire him. /v CBS just lost me with this evil deed of coloring Steve Bannon to look evil. This is horrible of 60 minutes we so trusted. Very dishonest. WHY?? /v I did not know much of Steve Bannon other than what the extremely left leaning liberal press had reported on him. That being said after watching this interview I love the guy. Keep up the good work Steve. I loved these quotes of his...Steve Bannon to Chris Christie - ...You're not on the plane you're not on the team, He didn't make the plane... Also ...I don't need to be lectured by a bunch of limousine liberals from the upper East Side and the Hamptons... A direct slap in the face to Charlie Rose and all the higher ups at CBS. Love it! What a pair of brass balls on this guy. /v Bannon is a hero. Not interested in watching the reporters gang up on their target 3 on 1 afterwards to create the illusion of majority opinion in the minds of the public they try to brainwash. Absolutely filthy behavior. Shame on you. /v Steve Bannon has balls.  And that scares the crap out of the professional politicians in the DC swamp and our mendacious mainstream media. /v Trump and Bannon are defending our great nation and its citizens from a system of corruption that goes well beyond evil.......the American political system has been planted with pedophile scumbag politicians who never were elected by the people but rather a fraudulent election system.... where voting equipment is hacked and Illegal aliens vote by the millions .... dead people vote by the millions....this to name a few aspects of an American election system gone totally left and corrupted to its core...created  to service and elect politicians that are willing to sell out our American values and heritage plus loot our great nation economically.....Obama was there super star .....elected by a fraudulent voting system and propped up by the fake news .......this scenario has been exposed .......Obama was a traitor and more over a terrorist !! We as Americans must now change the landscape in our election system.... root out deception and destroy the cancerous core that has produced so many false prophets in our great nation.........Thank you Steve Bannon and Donald Trump for exposing what many have died trying to expose for many decades.........We will make America Great Again and the Patriots are rising to this cause ..................In God We Trust and MAGA !!!\nShow less\nREPLY /v Doubles down in shirts as well. /v Overrated, unqualified, failed POS taking out his frustrations about himself with the world. Don't give this man a platform to voice his bloody nonsense. Did this piece of crap spawn? Disgusting with no moral bearings. Would sell his mother and daughter for his 15 min of fame. Wanted to look like a king maker but ended up being a failure. /v I like this guy. He looks really high. /v so he's Irish hahaha not even American lol. /v Bannon was right, because at the end of the day there's not a man or woman on the planet that can look back and honestly say that they haven't said something deeply inappropriate in private. Maybe Ned Flanders is off the hook, but that's about it. /v Hope you guys saw how Charlie Rose was very defensive in this /v Bannon must have learned a thing or two from Squealer (Orwell's Animal Farm). /v Why do I get this Dallas vibe from this man? He reminds me of someone that would go up against J.R. over oil lol /v Steve, Move to Whitefish for good ! /v This guy is really smart; that's why the Media hate him so much... /v Locker room talk. I mean he confessed to harassing someone. /v Still saying that was locker room talk...lol .i don't  think he was in a locker room /v Bannon really gets it. I wish he were still in the White House. /v YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE ABOUT THESE INTERVIEWS?  When they CUT THE SENTENCES AND FULL STATEMENTS to frame it the way the producers want you to see it.  You can CLEARLY SEE the EDITORS (if you are real news.....why edit my statements?) keep cutting Steve's sentences. /v Why does he look high? /v sounds like charlie rose is taking it personal. /v So glad the racial demographics are changing in the America. These white Christian terrorist need to go  /v Rose comes out smelling like a rose.. fertilizer. /v He's wearing a black suit jacket on top of a black button up on top of a black button up...why? /v Go away un-American Charlie Rose you belong in the swamp with Chuck and Mccain! /v This guy know how to handle the hysterical media you just don't back down /v Kills me how they talk about blind loyalty. It's was the msm is doing everyday! /v All of us off white people were abused by the Romans and the Turks. When the Europeans found out we were not pure white the beat us and nearly killed us all. Off White is out of sight! We need to be as violent as everyone else to show off white need special treatment too. Death to all colors but mine (and the green people of course) we hate racist brown, black, yellow, red, and white peoples of the Earth. What I hated most they would kick us and call us as the puppy word, I hate being called puppy and kicked by all the evil racist white, black, red, yellow, and the worst were the brown people. Sana Anna killed almost all of us who were in Mexico. Genocide' he was a tyrant killer. Up with off white down with the rest of the world. Oh yea we believe in raping and robbing everyone. It's just in our Genes. We do not have an ability to follow laws that were not written by any non-off white so we do not obey your laws. Can I get some money now? Some free housing? I just need bus money. Off White Lives Matter...More!\nWe once had a beautiful mountain kingdom everybody loved one another and we were seen as very successful by all the other kingdoms. The valley people wanted our riches, we told them we would gladly share them. It wasn't enough for the people below to share in our success and they invaded us killing everyone.\nAfter the valley people defeated us they dug into the mountain in search of our treasure, what did they find? /v Bannon was right on the money! Funny Liberals trying to play all moral, and high. You people talk about blind loyalty, what about supporting Hilary? You liberals are out of touch with reality! /v Bannon has begun holding private meetings with insurgent challengers, vowing his support. Hes coordinating with conservative mega-donor ROBERT MERCER, who is prepared to pour millions of dollars into attacks on GOP incumbents. Bannon has also installed a confidant at an outside group that is expected to target Republican lawmakers and push the Trump agenda. The Mercer family is running the WH. /v Serious comment - does he have pink eye? /v *There's a side of Charlie Rose & David PacKman that's pure EVIL.* /v slime ball. these people got conned by a con man. tiny hands is a con man. /v He looks like a character off The Sopranos /v DemoKKKrats. /v People cared! Remember who won the popular vote. /v MSM snakes at it again /v Former White House Chief 'Tragedist' lol.\nClassic freudian slip? /v Love Bannon. /v Amazing /v Real Red Neck /v Bannon is obviously syphilitic. Black-hearted, and dying. /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQF3Hi0VKs /v greatness /v Body Language Analysis No. 4057: Steve Bannon's 60 Minutes Interview - Nonverbal and Emotional Intelligence\nhttp://www.bodylanguagesuccess.com/2017/09/body-language-analysis-no-4057-steve.html /v Charlie Rose's remaining corpse got rekt big timw by Bannon. /v Bannon a worthy successor to Andrew brietbart /v that's messed up what CBS did to Bannon, they over saturated him to make him look bad, look at those red rings around his eyes. you can tell by the curtains. look at the curtains behind Bannon then look at the curtains behind the interviewer /v Great job Bannon! /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgliVyV1WqY /v So Trump is just lawless! /v bannon is fantastic /v BANNON Rules!!! /v Lard /v Bannon 2020 /v Bannon the Barbarian!  /v I love Steve Bannons loyalty. /v Gatling  Canon Bannon Rapid Firing Show.I  can see Political Pansies Melt Down. A Hurricane Daisy Cutter. /v BANNON IS A FLAME THROWER HE DONT PLAY WOO HOO  /v Master. /v Love Steve Bannon!!! /v He has noooooo lips. So scary /v Bannon is a great American and has a far better grasp on history and reality then the entirety of our media. His thinking is exactly what this country needs and what liberals and the media don't get about our country. /v <--------- This Native American loves Steve Bannon and President Trump... #MAGA /v Charlie Rose digging up old dirt AGAIN.... Lets look into Charlie's past.... is it true you are GAY.. Charlie... divorced back in the 1980's... what have YOU been HIDING since... HMMMM.... Would you like to DENIE the RUMORS here...???? HMMM....? /v Steve Bannon is a great American period end of story. /v Well...he's back to raking the hay with his other redneck southerners..... /v What an absolutely evil human being. /v I just wanna know why his eyes are red....jesus /v Peter thanks for having me on, this was a lot of fun and of course it was a pleasure singing with you! You're the man - Ant /v I thought you both did great, so I can't decide who won (I'm a undesided person, sorry) though I have to say, I thought the Metal was a bit much. But other than that, Peter, Anthony great job. I would like to see a cover video of an 80's song that can't get enough of. It's called Ride Like the Wond by Christopher Cross. /v i love how Skyrim is a genre  /v It's too funny /v n o w m y b e d s h e e t s s m e l l l I k e y o u . /v Anthony? You here?! Peter! You will have to explain... how come? Wow!! Cool!! /v Please do Evermore from the new Beauty and the Beast! /v My fave was the country genre!! Sounded like it could have been the original song! :) /v I think Peter won. The heavy metal threw me off /v Please make a Dear Evan Hansen cover of Waving Through a Window or For Forever seems right up your alley /v I got surprised with PTX! It was unexpected ! /v Peter Hollens, can you do Lili Marlene? It's my favorite song, and my great grandfather and I used to sing it together when I was a child. He used to sing it as well with his men during WW2 a lot. You can choose between the original German version or sing it in English of course. There are also two ways to sing it, either a more slow and sad solo or a duet that's much more upbeat and happy. Much care from Deutschland! Love your work and thank you! There is the Marlene Dietrich 1915 version, and then there's a 1939 version, plus the versions out there of soldiers singing it. It's in a bunch of different languages too like English, German, French, Italian, Russian, and Japanese. /v I died laughing out loud at Pentatonix, and Polka. Skyrim as a genre, beautiful! /v That was amazing! I especially freaked out at Pentatonix and Eric Whitacre. :D /v Oh my goodness!  This was so much fun to watch!  I'm an old soul.  More Sinatra please!  :) /v I laughed very hard in the opera part when the song was translated in Italian ahhaah /v I've been watching Peter Hollens since like 2011 or something and I never get sick of it! You are so amazing! /v Why Did Country,EDM, and the Broad way sound better then the original /v I love the country  version i dont know why it just sounds so good /v Genera ideas: 8-bit, rap, more specific Broadway musical styles. /v This made me really happy! Hehe. You guys were great! It's definitely a tie. /v I love dat song make more songs love you guys /v I was cackling at Peter dressed as Edward Scissorhands.

Shout out to Pentatonix, RIP Avi... /v Okay, but what's that Van Morrison-thing?! It does sound nothing like him ... /v That was amazing!

Such an amazing voice! Oh, and the 10 sec song guy has an impressive Sinatra =) /v you should do simple kind of man by lynyrd skynyrd /v Well I grinned big at the opera, Peter's reaction to metal was perfect comedy, Weird Al look at 3:07 = beeg LOL...all really really goooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /v plzzzz do a battle with the song believer from imagine dragons /v Peter Hollens you are amazing talented. I love listening to you. Keep sharing your gifts. You are brilliant. /v I almost want an entire cover in the opera style /v This was honestly the best shape of you 'cover' or whatever you wanna call it i've seen so far /v I looooved it!! :D so entertaining and such great talent, I wanna see moreee!! :D I loved the funk, country, Sinatra, Chant versions and I laughed so hard at the Skyrim and Polka ones. @Peter, your Italian is good! Haha so weird to hear you speak my native language. I adore you and your wife but I think that the challenge was won by Anthony (forgive mee). Haha /v THAT. WAS. INCREDIBLY. AMAZING!!!!! Keep going guys! !! Big love from Italy! !!!! /v Omg you where on the news in the Netherlands /v @PeterHollens, this was fantastic! @Pentatonix was the best!

I cannot pick a winner. /v So many parodies in one video!!!! lol /v How can you sing literally everything! /v I'm not a fan of this song but this was AWESOME /v I love how Peters is a general red button, and the tense one songs guy has an easy button. /v super cool and creative. The fact that PTX and Skyrim are their own genres is perfection! :) /v wait what this is a rap battle? /v Could you possibly sing Siuil a Run? /v Apparently, Skyrim is now a genre /v Well well well ... What can i say ? Incredible, like always. \nDo you know what would be incredible too ? Singing Johanna or Pretty Women from the movie Sweeney Todd, i think it would be great.\nPlease, do it ... please /v Because frank sinatra is a genre /v when did Pentatonix become a genre? /v wow opera and broadway was amazing!!

She downloaded his music to my phone I do have to say I was quite shocked at my first impression of him, little over 48 hrs later and my grown ass is driving to work listening to him and now currently on lunch break in my SUV listening to him on repeat. Even silenced my girlfriends call until the song was finished, SAD but I don't care ! this mother fucker can sing /v Omg i been waiting the longest for this song finally!

It is trending and I clicked on it thinking I was gonna hear rap or hip hop, but instead I got watered down pop country.  I haven't listened to country music since the 90s when country sound was full of Reba, Shania, Trisha, Patty Loveless, Garth, Pam Tillis,  Sammy Kershaw, Lorrie  Morgan, Tanya Tucker, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Brian White, Dwight Yoakum, Wade Hayes, Doug Stone, Collin Raye, Mark Chestnut Terri Clark and any more that I consider the golden age of true country music.  Now country sounds so blended with other genres of music that I would rather listen to classic country then to return to listening to modern country. /v Vega platform /v Except they did not make a Firenza until 1982. In 1976 it was called the Starfire. /v 2:45 when I finish class /v Calvin Harris has no limits as a music producer /v Great for a laugh!

I will see him as Abe Sapien. #raindropskeepsfallingonmyhead /v I know nothing about this movie, but is this somehow connected to Hellboy? /v Was that a kaiju scream at the end? /v I am also saying thank you for making a trailer that doesn't look and sound like the others. /v Abe? is that you? /v is this ocean master's origin movie? /v It's fucking Abe from Hellboy.

It actually looks pretty original and interesting. /v i'm sorry I Didn't like it /v For some reason this reminds me of Hellboy /v I'm still kind of bumed were getting this and not Hellboy 3 but oh well this will hopefully be good in its own right. /v She could of just  him off. /v illegals import more illegals by dapa/daca. democrat party turn traitors against usa after 1990s. in exchange they let mexico/others burden usa one sided while self enrich by abuse public union system for pension increase. \n\nmedical/tech giants inflate prices. during primary/post election dems communist style attack or stage incidents prior/post election with police stand downs and media spin things.\n\n antifa outfit=black shirts of fascist italy during ww2. during inauguration dem  break glass  nazi style. evil  illegals support  keeping usa open border exploited. \n\ndems lied 3 times about enforce immigration while create policies for migrant crisis. so many taxpayer funded policies for illegals that legal citizens can never get. the fact living/operating cost in California never lowered only increase like Obamacare proves most illegals are here to abuse benefits.\n\ndaca/dapa destroy sympathy for real refugees while shameless use children as meat shields to demand entitlement and teach them to be loyal to other countries. /v You're a gay fish /v Animal beasteality at it's finest. /v Trailers reveal too much these days. What's the point of seeing the movie now? /v A M A Z I N G ! ! ! /v I want to get an Axolotl now... /v Seems like a decent movie that will fail really hard on the box office. /v I actually hope she knows ASL and not some fake ass sign language.

If you have only cool water. The water isn't cool because you have no hot water to know the water is cool. What damages the racist ideology more is Asians do very well in America, so do the Latinos, Arabians, and Indians Three of the races fought brutal wars not to long ago with white american ancestors. The Asians fought in WW2, Korea war, and the Vietnam war which many white Americans died. But people in from those asain  countries do very well even better than whites in America. Latinos have had wars with Americans, so have the Arabians. How are these three races dealing with the evil white racism people in America?  How many war with Africa had the United States fought? Try to use your racism card out of that black people!\nOnly way to prove racism is to move half of million blacks from United States to Japan, India, Iran, Russia, China, Australia, Israel, and a country in Europe. Moving half a million black people from the united States back to a country in Africa would prove the racist ideology wrong.\nIf the half million black people in this nations become successful without welfare and stay out of prison than people can say the United States is a racist nation of people. But in Africa black people have lower quality of life,  and are murdered more...etc. /v Please be an Abe sapien prequel and of the hellboy movie does good, to become part of it.

See a doctor. /v I imagine the word sh*t! was said countless times during the SpaceX program /v The sliding action was glorious. /v Reminded me of when Tony Stark was trying to put Iron Man's flight thrusters together. Sometimes you have to run before you can walk. /v That is so wicked how quickly the ORB comes down on the pad to just a couple meters above it before slowing down enough to land safely and successfully. I understand why it has to be like that though.. I bet ROE along with entire mission control can be seen holding their breath trying to get everything right 30-45 seconds before landing. Crazy stuff but I applaud SpaceX for the progress being made with everything they have done as well as NASA for their help with SpaceX along with all they have done decades ago with space exploration. Simply human curiosity at its best! Thank you to everyone involved in every way possible. Godspeed! /v Why can't this happen to North Korea? /v Really fun way to make a short with rocket failures... Maybe the most expensive 2 minutes out there made by a single company. /v Next request: A rocket that doesn't spontaneously combust with unintended impact /v Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.\n~~Elon Musk /v It looks simple, but landing a rocket vertically is an amazing technical achievement. The automatic pilot can land it even on a boot on the waves. Wauw! /v ah yes the good old explosions /v Well actually.. If I was apart of ISIS this is how I would like to land the Orbital Rocket Boosters /v I don't understand why it has to explode at the drop of a hat, I thought things only do that in the movies. /v this is like kerbal space program. gotta reload that quick save /v Was it directed by Michel Bay? /v That's what happens when you let Bubbles the chimp take control of the rocket. /v They barely touch the ground an explode immediately. /v Does anybody know what this music is called? /v And meanwhile North Korea is building and launching rockets with a different purpose in mind. /v I was expecting the last rocket to explode too /v Rocket science is apparently more art than science. /v If that drone ship landing is real time, it came in so fast I am in awe that it worked. A+ /v The only time when something falls over it actully explodes /v In order to make cake you got to break some eggs. Keep pushing forward!! /v Just... don't show this vid to the dudes y'all are signing up for to inhabit mars /v why not grappling hooks that shoot out from the landing pad? Or something like humongous air bags. Grappling hooks would be badass tho /v Man, It must have been a circus at SpaceX after these events. /v Directed by Michael bay /v Is this by chance the most expensive video of stuff blowing up on the internet? /v Wow they really updated the graphics for ksp /v PRIMITIVE ROCKETS! WHERE'S THE SECRET SPACE PROGRAM ANTIGRAVITY CRAFTS?! /v Is this why we haven't been to the moon recently? /v If a rocket can fail, it is ok that I do too.  Subscribed! /v This is PR gold. /v people don't realize how big the rockets are\nhttps://goo.gl/images/6XTStE /v No rockets were harmed in the making of this video. /v I like it how they show their own fails. /v I liked the kadaffi scud missle, put the missle in a camels mouth and kick the camel in the balls. /v    !!              ,  ,  ,    ! \nP.S.   ,      !!  ! /v  ,     -    /v KSP ? Nope, IRL /v The awesome rocket porn. /v Most expensive youtube video? /v Kudos to painstaking trial and error. Progress. /v    ! /v     /v Where's Micheal Bay? /v Me playing Kerbal Space Program. /v Monty Python /v I see you spacex... /v Pure explosion porn /v lol /v Tis but a scratch /v Rest In Peace, brave pilots  /v TAM TA RAM TAM TA RAM  AMAZING /v Somebody at SpaceX likes watching Danny's KSP videos. XD /v Cool /v while (1){\n    fork();\n} /v TIL  rockets just explode like hollywood cars /v You guys are awesome! /v This is so awesome! /v Video budget: 1.2 billion /v The future. /v BOOM!! HAHAHA................. \n\n\nSCIENCE!!!  /v Awesome /v Kerbal space program anyone? /v Dame KSP 2 looks amazing /v Jebediah Kerman approves /v ((rand % 1) > 0)? expload() : expload(); /v Rocket hits a pebble *Explodes* /v https://youtu.be/rnJ4blc_S6g                   best I ever saw /v Is NASA this candid about their failures too? /v The successful landings at the end are absolutely amazing! Is this SpaceX just poking fun at itself? How refreshing! Great upload. /v _Jimmy, I get it you have great discontent for Trump and worship mentality for Obama_ and Hilary. But now it's sickening and annoying...no wonder your son had a brain issue it's because during conception your semen contained brain-rot DNA. /v Jimmy: Do you really believe the crowd was the biggest in history\n\nSpicer: The president has made it clear..... /v Kimmel tries to make trump look bad at any cost, he totally failed, that might say something to the left, Spicer with total integrity. seems to be a very trustworthy man, /v Jimmy should stop trying to get is agenda involved, and just interview the guy. Jimmy, I don't care what you're thoughts/opinions on the president are, show the man some respect. /v Wow Melissa really has lost a lot of weight, you go girl, looking good! /v i guesss you could say this interview is spicy huehuehuehue /v I think Sean Spicer is a classy and integer person...wouldn't mind having a beer with him. /v I'm very glad he came to the show. And that Jimmy invited him. /v Did I just hear him right? 18:48 his heart is in the right price  /v I'm not saying everyone should love this guy but from what it seems it was a guy that was so excited to get his dream job and got caught up in a bad situation. /v At the end of the day he's human just like all of us. He's probably glad to be done with that job. /v Still talking about Trump? Un-subbed. What happened to quality content? Has the lower class fallen this low? /v Melissa McCarthy is looking good these days /v At one time I watched Jimmy... Yea not anymore. He's nothing but a tool... Pathetic /v P A R D O N  M Y  S A N D W I C H  B R E A T H /v I respect a man that goes into the lion's den and smiles through it, even if i don't like him. /v So, we don't have a president. We have a dictator who has people to help him be a president and carry though with his ideas. Terrible times we live in if that's what people voted for. /v Spicey is back, guess who's back?! Spicey is back!!! Lol /v Why can't all interactions between Trump's current or past staff and establishment journalism and entertainment be as polite, respectful and cordial as this. A lot of coastal power-players could learn something from this. /v He says that he's forced to say stuff he doesn't necessarily believe to be true....wtf? Where's your dignity? /v I wish Sean would tell us whats actually on his mine... something tells me that could be a full season on Netflix /v Looks like spicy has gained some weight. /v Honestly, I thought it was going to be worse: he actually demonstrated through his responses that he had a conscience, and that he was thoughtful at least, which earns some respect in my book. Well done /v Huge props to this man for coming out and doing this. I really don''t approve of anything he's done politically but it's nice to see he's a good sport about all this, especially knowing how much people talk about it /v This whole thing just seemed like Kimmel's biggest chance to take his shots at Trump and it seemed like a Spicer gotcha piece too. Spicer handled the pressure really well, gave really good answers to Kimmel's biting sarcasm and ego. /v THANK the powers he's out.......Sarah Sanders is proof that a woman can do a better job, thanks TRUMP!!!! /v He is a liar. /v Omg I thought this was joke at first /v So many people are angry that he lied but these same people voted for Clinton, liberal hypocrisy knows no limits. /v 18:48 His heart's in the right  price I see what you did there spicey /v Should've went to Colbert /v hahahaahah he's in so much pain, how pathetic /v The Press Secretary is the liaison between the administration and the press,  he serves at the pleasure of the president. That should not mean he should follow orders. We are not that kind of country. Loyalty before correctness is the OPPOSITE of the American experiment. My country right or wrong? No. In America it's push our country into the light of truth  and people DIE so that one of our rights is the critique of our own nation in order to do so.\nSo, loyalty to party, to president, to flag....is contingent. If anyone thinks otherwise, read John Adams, read Jeffersons letters....starting with the Bill of Rights. Americans standing with the president, and Americans standing against the president....are absolutely equally American.\nBut there is objective truth, and that was Spicers job, finding it. /v The President has made it real clear Kimmel the fight is going on today!. Liars will be picked into little pieces of crap when we're all done swamp man. /v I love it how americans always talk about how great it is that they have a freedom of speech and freedom on press (its what makes our country great), when in fact, based on any international study, americans are not on the frontline when it comes to this. In fact, most western countries are doing better when it comes to freedom of speech & press. /v He's got to lie or he will loose his job. He chose his job. /v Did he say Trumps heart is at the right price /v No one put a gun on his head to lie for Donald Trump. Spicer was not qualified for his post to begin with. Why give more face time to liars? I don't believe a word Sean Spicer says. Stop wasting time on liars Kimmel! /v 'Tablivision' where The Mooch was helping with campaign! Congrats Spicer! You look so rested and we know you are much happier. Thanks for serving, regardless of non disclosure agreement with 45... we are happy to have your satirical nemesis win the emmy. Because without your  of WH work, none of that would have been possible. \n softly and carry a big STICK. -United States /v Kimmel was the best of the late night talk hosts but when he kept up the moronic statements after Trump was elected I couldnt watch anymore. Havent watched him and cancled my subscription to the Stern show because I cant stand to listen to the rhetoric from these limousine liberals. /v I don't like to relish in other peoples problems Wow, if we all lived like that. You see people cheering on the death and destruction left in the wake of these hurricanes because they voted for somebody that they don't like. /v Great interview. Props to Sean Spicer. I'm sure he went thru hell. I know he's glad he's out of that mess. /v This is the first JimmyKimmel video i could watch post trump. /v I've got to agree with him on one thing. Free speech is pretty amazing. /v Does Spicer think the tRUMP has the skill set for the job? /v His side portrait is exactly like Melissa...  /v I like Spicer and I like Kimmel and this was a great interview. Gets tiring seeing these fake Hollywood doucbags always coming on and was nice to see a real nice genuine conversation for once /v I love how it's cool to hate Trump. He's basically one of the most left Republicans out there. The only reason he ran as Republican was bc Hillary ran as a Dem. /v 18:46 His heart's in the right price. Hahaha. /v now his voice makes sense. tiny little man. must have needed to get back to the north pole. /v Kimmel you just got owned by Sean, he shot down all of your stupid attempted attacks on Trump.  Stop being a cry baby and be a true American celebrity.  I was a big fan, not anymore, your rating are dropping fast, my friend. MAGA! /v Still lying ... back-peddling ...covering up & 'I was just following orders!'... /v Boo. He just talked in circle /v Why do we care about Melissa Mccarthy's views on Trump? /v Hammer me if you will, but Sean did a great job on Kimmel's show. Spicer is defending his tenure serving a president that's not exactly popular to say the least. I don't even know why he did the show. But kudos to Kimmel for not being too hard on Spicer, and just letting him talk. You don't have to agree with Spicer, or Kimmel to accept that this is a solid interview. This is Kimmel at his best in my opinion. These days, I'd rather see this approach than all the hate filled nonsense that's spewed by everyone. /v Kimmel's main reason to have him on is to TRY to dig dirt on the president. Scumbag /v Wow, I'm surprised the people who run this Youtube didn't cut this interview into 20 different 1-2 minute clips. /v Trump is going to resent Spicer getting all this attention. /v 18:40 ...his hearts' in the right price /v I don't agree with what Sean Spicer stands for politically, but I am happy he did get out and is in a better place. That is important. /v Kimmel and Obama should get a room /v Why does Sean Spicer look so much older now that he hasn't been on tv in awhile /v I really detest your president BUT I like you a lot /v I don't think I'll ever bring myself to stop loving Sean Spicer. As strange as it sounds given the circumstances, but I put him in with James Comey: we disagree about a lot of things, but he seems to at least have integrity. It was literally his job to lie for the president, but he seems to take it with no real satisfaction. He was doing his job, which is precisely what he should have done.\n\nHe's obviously holding a bit back here, but he seems to want to be as honest as he can be without slandering his own boss. For anyone else I would respect that stance, and I don't want to put him to some higher standard. /v Damn Spicy is shorter than I thought /v Best Freudian slip goes to ....  his heart is in the right price[place] /v It's sad that all these former staff members are trying to make themselves look human again. /v I think I like him now! Kimmel killed it though! /v world war 3 is about to start repent to THE LORD JESUS CHRIST and be saved from hell now! /v ENOUGH WITH THE INVISIBLE HAMSTER /v Geez Kimmel's audience is way more polite and respectful than Colbert's audience when Scaramucci was on. /v Nice to know Sean Spicer has a sense of humour. /v I know I'm not hearing this at 18:45 his heart is in the right race ... /v Regarding Trump: 18:47 I know his heart is in the right PRICE. /v 18:48 IN THE RIGHT PRICE... WOW /v Honestly his loyalty to trump is baffling. /v Sean Spicer is first class guy !!!!! /v Watch everything at 1.25 or 1.5 speed. People sound slightly more funny and you can consume more content in a shorter period. :) /v All I can say here is that at his core, Spicer is human. Behind the coverups and the frustrations and the deflections. He was a man doing the job he was instructed to do. /v I met him while he was still the press secretary and he gave me a tour of the West Wing. He really is such a nice guy in person. A big shame he got such a terrible job. /v Ugh. Dude. You don't work for that prick anymore. Still, I did enjoy Spicy more than SHS...she looks like she's on some pretty powerful tranquilizers and probably martinis. It looks like her eyes are drooping and she talks in slow motion. /v What a great impression of Melissa McCarthy! /v Time to rehab the public image. /v I always Like Sean /v @spicyboi /v What's up, Shouty Spice? /v mental usual resemble summit retail model. /v Thanks for posting Paty InStyle-Decor Luxury Lifestyle http://instyle-decor.com Beverly Hills /v still wearing cheap, boxy suits /v Aww spicey  /v the clapping at the beginning seemed staged... /v Two bozos!

She is beautiful.. /v Just another day!\nLooks to husband\nOh... damnit /v I am here, 'cause I know the comments will be 'hella' mean. /v I love her name Olympia gave it a nice touch /v Oh no wonder this as trending. I thought it was some random couple but it's SERENA WILLIAMS. /v Thumbnail is basically a stock image at this point /v If this was a Black man with a White woman he'd be called a sellout and a coon. I bet most of the likes are from Black women. /v THEY DESERVE EVERYTHING SINGLE BLESSING IN THIS UNIVERSE /v This is the cutest thing ever /v That's a cute baby.

Who are these people? /v I'm Asian and I find this nigger-like /v Who gives a fuck. /v Why are black women so unattractive? /v Cute baby, I wish you both a good life :D. God Bless. /v I don't know anything about this relationship, but she does not seem like his ideal type of personality to jive with. He is one of very few people that can get away with calling his new baby Alexis. I feel like there are going to be so many Amazon jokes for her in Elementary School and then everyone will have moved past it and that name will be more prevalent I guarantee. /v My only question is: why is Alex's Snoo complete white while Serena's is her actual skin color? It looks really weird, like she's different than him or something. Make them both white or add some damn color to the other one. /v Why and how is this trending /v When your wife is more man than woman /v I keep seeing people talking about racist, but where they at tho? /v White guys winning.

I don't give a fuck /v I can't find the racism /v The comment section has more people complaining about racism than actual racists /v No lie... I'm still trying to figure out how this relationship happened /v Looks like there is no chemistry between them. What sad sad thing.\nShe tried to get a black guy date and marry, seems that they all rejected her or they didn't give her the respect and love she wanted.\nBlack girls don't go to another race until they get tired of betrayal, rejection and lying and conning from black men. \nI wish them best of luck, but this glorifying interracial shit should stop.Because it's making the dark skin people inferior and the whites most desirable. All the filthy rich dark skin men and women always desperate to be noticed by the whites.This is bad mental enslavement. They look at their own as less human than other races. It's just sad. /v Everyone is saying there are racist comments yet I haven't seen a single racist comment. Anyways nice video /v Eww race mixing is so disgusting /v Beautiful Family!\nWelcome to the World, Alexis!\nWe love you, Serena!\n#BlackGirlMagic /v I see all these comments talking about how they hate all these racist comments yet I don't really see any besides the ones talking about how they hate the racist comments /v Niggers /v Ew, get that pathetic inferior white male away from that beautiful black queen. /v Liberalism is clearly a mental disorder. Keep promoting hate. /v The entire video is framed on lies. \n\nThis narrative that white nationalism is entirely irrational and based in nothing more than hate is a complete and flat-out lie. \n\nThe statistics about domestic terrorism are, at best, incredibly misleading.\n\nThe theory that our systems of power our heavily influenced by corrupt white supremacists is a lie.\n\nThe very use of the term white supremacy is a lie. It's a propagandized scare term for the mainstream that is not an accurate representation of their views.\n\nThe talk of psychoanalysis for these people as if they are serial killers is just plain ridiculous. Oh no, wrong opinion spotted! We must find out what went wrong in their childhood. /v Youtuber trying to reach 13k subscribers. I make natural hair/fashion videos and would love if anyone subscribed if they like what they see  /v This is the 1000th comment!! :-) /v Wait, you all caught that part about Trump eliminating the funding for anti-hate groups like this, right? /v Deport the nazis to europe ~  /v So this actual passes for comedy now days? /v It is Antifa that's instigating violence across America. That is what the statistics say. So why is this disinformation here? /v But how does the hug disengage them from the Nazis? Like... If they stay Nazis to get hugs... /v I wish Samantha would get lost and stumble onto a busy freeway  /v I love how many troll comments Sam gets. They're obsessed with her. She's obviously doing a great job. /v Pity the website doesn't accept donations using non-US credit cards :( Any way to change that? /v Dislike. Have a nice day. :) /v white people created this problem, and its our job to fix it.... I'm sorry fellow white person, but i didn't create any problem that you scream in your pillow every night, and it's not my job to fix your motive. /v  *Would you call Dylan roof a terrorist? * /v What right wing terrorism cases? All this video covers is two case studies. /v Black pride? Awesome! Fantastic! Great to see that kind of empowerment!\n\nWhite pride? Despicable! Hateful! These people are literally murderous nazis! /v Uncle Sam sure did change hitlers opinion about being superior. /v i saw the title about domestic terrorists and was like finally a video about antifa/blm domestic terror. but no, it's still fake news. /v *SO HAPPY* to have you back, Samantha B! I have missed you! /v I love the tip of the hat to Mel Brooks /v Okay, I won't punch them but I'm not hugging them. Ew. /v For those who believe climate change is man-made guess again:\nhttps://newswars.com/solar-physicist-explains-how-the-sun-controls-climate-not-man\nhttps://newswars.com/scientist-debunks-outsells-al-gores-propaganda /v Come on, at least put the link in the video description. /v No matter your race or ethnicity. No matter your political standpoint. Organizations like love after hate and others that prevent or convert people from an extremist path should be funded. However, in April, 2017, the federal government withheld a $400,000 grant for Love after hate that was promised by Obama's administration, despite the organization receiving more and more calls for help. We need to unite on this issue, instead of shouting about whose side is more extremist because each side wants to distance itself from its fringe elements, and convince the Trump administration that funding groups like Love after hate is a worthy goal.\n#loveafterhate\n#huganazi /v The only hate I see is coming from losers like you. /v ...But the domestic terrorists are Antifa. And nothing you say or do is going to make the brown races more suited for life in the western world. /v There are young kids out there who are being put on one side or the other even though they never even thought in racist terms.  You, Samantha,  and other people like you need to realize that racism is dead.  Kids judge other people by other factors not the color of their skin. /v Good god, I love her...I LOVE her!! /v On 9/11 more people were killed than all right wing terrorists combined. /v Milk is white. Cotton is white. Caucasians are light brown. They had to wear white robes to match their narrative. F*ing light brown people. /v Because trying to calm the Nazis and convince them to give up white supremacy worked *so well* in the 1930s /v 1 minute in and already factually inaccurate. /v No mention of black extremists and black pride? /v Was that the place where Bruce Lee fought Chuck Norris? /v I recognize Fred Armisen but who is Carrie? /v Nice that these groups are being humanized and people are asking where these young kids went wrong and that's great, but people of color are nothing but gang bangers and thugs or terrorists  /v It never left, straight up Sammy B /v The show that tries waay too hard to make you think women can be funny. /v I hate REAL Nazis. I hate REAL white supremacist and I hate real KLANSMEN.  Trouble is  a lot of people being labeled with those today  are nothing of the sort.  Theyvare just conservative people with  traditional conservative  values. \nThat being said, I hope that the  decrying of hate and violence as a means to achieve one's political ends also applies to clearly anti-American communist groups such as Antifa. /v I wanna eat out Samantha for hours /v I'm just going to hug everyone, and assume most of them are white supremacists. That way I can feel like I'm doing my part. /v Finally, someone said it. /v The amount of statistical gymnastics needed to make white terrorism a bigger threat is staggering. They use number of incidents, meaning 9/11 and one white guy shooting a white cop are both one incident. Muslim attacks are far deadlier. /v TIL Portland is not as chill as I thought it was. /v Oprah was OPPRESSED into 3.2 billion dollars and all I gots was white privilege, FAIR? ......Pizza----BLACK OLIVES MATTER. hey, FREE Air Jordans in Florida baby, chicks in New York paying top dollar for them /v This was beautiful! I laughed out loud and clap when the plane lands also! /v Why focus on race at all? The world is built around nationality, a legal status. By no means am I saying be xenophobic or fascist, but I am saying that being the same race won't lower tensions. Just ask north and South Korea, Russia and Europe, china and Taiwan, etc... /v Now I want to see Samantha in an episode of Homeland /v In the begining I thought Picciolini was a genuine guy, until he tweeted that the nazis were fighting for Russia in the Ukraine conflict.  Then I sighed in disbelief. /v Simply do unto others as you would want others to do to you and you can't go wrong. /v There has been an ongoing push to treat white supremacy and hate as a disease and a mental illness. /v Samantha bee is a humorless hack fraud. /v Smug Liberal Alert /v Wuv, trew wuv, is what bwings us togever today. /v Pride is a sin. #PurplePower. /v About as funny as leukemia. /v Hedge funds!

Just think about that. /v If your side is the one punching political opposition...\n\nThat means you're the terrorists, by the very definition of terrorism. /v Does anyone else hate her as much as me? /v If you are only standing up to white supremacists but ignoring black supremacy groups like the black panthers, the black nation of Islam and the black israelites (who I personally had a negative experience with) then you are a coward and a phony.\nI stood toe to toe with the black israelites BY MYSELF while cowardly white people walked a long circle around them.

Where are the punchy guitar riffs? In fact, where are the guitars? I can barely hear them if they exist, just cranking out power chords. What happened to complex drums?

FOB you could and have done better. /v Those goats are gonna give me nightmares /v Hi , i loved it And i hope  they keep making more music  . i'm always listening  to your  music . i love them and adore fall out boy  i'm from Argentina /v #3 ON TRENDING IM PROUD OF MY BOYS /v Youngbloods: Such a good song we need to change our fan base name now...Pete Wentz: The Real Ones /v Pete Wentz doesn't bleed, pass it on. /v People are saying the song has My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark vibes. Obviously the video does, but the song to me kinda has a Back To Earth vibe. Just me? /v how many know that this is actually a parody of Kanye West's flashing lights mv? /v Good Song /v This so gooooooooood /v The credits tho  /v Flashing lights by kanye west /v YAY WERE TRENDING #3 !!!!  lets get to #1 /v Kanye Wests Flashing lights with llamas. cool. /v Me: *gets FOB advert before video starts* /v FOB never disappoints <3 /v Nice music video. /v The real ones /v Eww furries. /v ON REPEAT /v UESYESYEYSYYSNUAHS /v Flashing Lights - Kanye West /v Furry Propaganda /v Guys this is in trending!

I'm so proud  /v I got a Fall out boy ad :) /v not worth the upgrade, wait for the next iphone if u have the 7 /v fuck both of em i order nokia 3310 /v X is just a rushed prototype until they fix that obnoxious notch and implement touch ID beneath the screen. /v hey...it looks like you are going aagainst apple from few days...any specific reasons? /v I'm still using the iPhone 6 for 2 years and it hasn't broken down on me yet. /v i don't have any phone right now, but i've decided that im just going to get an Iphone 7 plus since the x is so expensive and the 8 and 8 plus are the same as the 7. /v Not a worthy upgrade. No new invention from apple. Atleast they can hav a 5 display in a iPhone 8 body. Disappointed  /v I like my iPhone 7 plus 256Gb.  I use it for my school. No need for laptops. I have the speed and space.  I don't need camcorder. I have it all in One.  I don't need another phone for next  . 5 years.  I think if you are working in Hospitals or making blueprint for companies this iPhone 7plus or a tablet will work fine. \n\nDon't need to upgrade.. it's not worth spending extra money. \n\nAnd if your in student budget then stick to $50 touch smart android it works that same. Basic need.. calls. Check your email n make calls.  Save your money  /v Apple says on their Website for the iPhone 8 & 8+: \nRedesigned stereo speakers are up to 25 percent louder and deliver deeper bass, enabling richer-sounding music, videos and speakerphone calls.\n\nDoes the iPhone X has the same speakers? Because they don't say anything about the speakers on their Website...? \n\n@EverythingApplePro /v I still have an iPhone 6  works fine for me. /v I personally don't think it's an big upgrade\nI'm just gonna wait until the X comes out next month\nI mean I've had the 7 plus since it first came out, and you should just go all out and get the X /v So what are ppl saying about the next one? /v I've i5s i6s i7plus should I also buy i8plus and ix /v Using a 5s now! Should I upgrade to 7 or 8?!! /v How much will the iPhone 7 plus cost /v I think the 6s is the best iphone because it still has the earphone jack /v Can the iPhone 7 plus case fit into the IPhone 8 plus ??? /v I'm going to make up my mind after Google's event on October 4. Then I'll decide between the iPhone 8 Plus and the Pixel 2. /v Have 7 not getting any iphone until this breaks  /v I'll go 7 plus to iPhone X just as long as the battery life isn't shorter on the X compared to the 7 which I believe its a plus battery in the X /v definitely not worth the upgrade! and if you do the new selfie portrait mode would be the only reason /v I'm getting a 64gb iPhone 6s because the headphone jack is appreciated in my pocket apple /v I got the 7 a month ago, the red one, I ain't gonna upgrade it, the red one is special!! /v I think geekbench score are fake because it says iphone x but it also displays carrier name which is not visible in top bar in iphone x also positioning of time and network signal bar is not correct /v Just by looking at the title I know he's going to say to keep the iPhone 7 plus,\nAnd I haven't even watch the video I'm still on the gay ass ad /v Hey venya geskin here. So let's talk about the iPhone 9 launch. It's only 363 days away. Can't wait so excited. /v Lol my iphone 5 is still very convenient for me /v iphone x is x or 10 (ten) ?? /v The deal breaker for me for the iPhone 10 is not integrating the cutout at the top of the screen. It totally ruins the full screen display...that's what I think. /v is it worth the upgrade from 6S Plus to The X ? /v #MBKHD has an actual iPhone 8 in his review  #blm /v still have 5s and its good than this shit /v If I were to get a upgrade I would get the IPhone X because there's really no improvements with the 8 and the X is going to be the future of iPhones so I would be good to not be stuck with a last gen phone y'all know what I mean /v I have an IPhone 7 Plus , is it worth to change? /v Noooo its not worth it, its better to buy iphone x /v No. It is not worth it. It would be better to wait till next year for another upgrade. /v Apple are money grabbers even though I own an iPhone I can't lie to myself like every other apple fanboys apple is way behind they out of ideas now they trying add things that android been having since 2012 the only reason I own an iPhone is for iMessage other than that nothing special. /v When r u guys going to do a GIVEAWAY? /v Should have called the usual 7S. Cause that's exactly what it is /v i still got a iphone 6 and cracked my screen so bad there is no home button  follow my ig for proof IG:lagusssss /v Honestly no I have 7 Plus black and it looks exactly the same aside from its features /v definitely more of an S upgrade than anything. I have a 7 plus, so ill be waiting till next year to see what they come out with then /v Who's else is watching this on their iPhone 6 /v Love that your videos are getting on trending :) /v I'm father claused into a deal with AT&T. I signed up waaaay prior to AT&T merging with Cingular. So I qualify for an upgrade every year around September to trade in for the new iPhone. I've had the iPhone 4, 5, 5s, 6 plus, 7 plus, and now I'll wait until November for the iPhone X. I don't have to pay anything on the phone, just the state tax or 69 dollars and the same price, 65 dollars a month. Been doing it for years /v Nah gonna skip this one and stick with my iPhone 3G ;) /v Yes!  Great bargain for the new 8 iPhone! /v This is when your subs explode XD /v I'm pretty happy with my 5s, just thinking about to upgrade to SE in the next year. /v if you have the money its worth the upgrade but then he says its not significant. how is this justifiable ? maybe if u upgrade with the next plan or something. (confused) /v I still have iPhone 6! I been waiting for the anniversary phone and I'm not that impressed to change. Might just get the 8 plus. /v You want me to give you some lip balm? /v The I phone is a sin, \n\n\n\n\n\nlike really.... the logo......bitten apple? Adam and Eve? :| /v Why fix something that isn't broken?, there will be a new model every year as long as dumb asses buy them. I've had the same phone for years and still play a ps3, I like vacations and making memories the hell with throwing money away on bs like a new shitty iPhone. Especially when in 6 months it will be the old one /v Is it me or does he look kinda pissed lmao hes usually happy and excited /v is upgrade worth it from iPhone 5s to iPhone 8??! /v I seriously got a brand new IPhone 7 Plus today. Due to my iPhone 6Plus acting up for a week and ultimately not charging up when I plugged in my USB charger to it. \n\nBut today, I plugged in the brand new USB charger that came with the iPhone 7 Plus to my iPhone 6 Plus. And now... my iPhone 6 Plus isn't acting up and it's charging normally. \n\nShould I return my iPhone 7 Plus, and stay with my 6 Plus? \n\nPlease respond!! /v 6s is still one of the best i think, why upgrade? why who cares about a bit better of a camera or some shit xD /v It doesn't seem like it but I have a 6s so I'm gonna love the new iPhone 8 plus /v Hi ~ONLY$25.49(25% off) smart iPhone 8/7 Battery Case, Your Best Power Companion On-The-Go! W/Code: VY67FO4A\nhttps://www.amazon.com/EUROB-Portable-Rechargeable-Extended-Protective/dp/B075D6DXDP /v they should've just named it 7s and 7s Plus /v Not going to upgrade. I guess I'll be waiting another year for the  XI . Other than the speed of the phone , it's the same phone. And I like my matte black color. /v I am thinking of getting a new iPhone (have been using my current one for 4 years LOL), and contemplating if I should just get 7 instead as it is almost 300 bucks cheaper than 8 and it seems that there is not much difference? /v I actually like the new gestures /v Hell no, I'll stick with my iPhone 7, plus the iPhone X looks so ugly from the back, they should have placed the camera on a more suitable and stylish way... and definitely seems they tried to copy Samsung on it. Bring Steve Jobs back  /v No 128 gB option only 64/256 lol 64?is not enough and 256 a bit too much for the average person ! Smh /v WTF Apple ?? iPhone X should be $700 & iPhone 8 $600. Phones should be getting cheaper not more expensive. /v The iphone 8 reminds me of the iphone SE.. just an in between model for the sake of releasing something. But Apple didn't upgrade it that much because they know it won't sell. As an iphone 6s user, I'd rather upgrade to a 7 which is cheaper than the 8 OR spend a little more with the X with a much more significant upgrade. Skipping the 8 for sure is the most logical thing to do. /v Nah I have the iPhone 7 256gb that is more than enough for a few years /v Should've just had an iPhone X and a 7s. /v Could you do a comparison video for the 6s+ vs 8+? I have the 6s+ and I held off on upgrading because I honestly don't know much about the 7....I'm the only iPhone user in my family lol. A comparison video would be amazing! I enjoy your videos very much!! Thanks for being on top of the Apple world!  /v Issa S I have a 6 plus looking to upgrade I'll go for the 8.... later in life /v I have a 6s. Is it worth upgrading? My 6s is still good but is it worth it? /v I have 6s i will buy iphone 7 \nNow its not worth upgrade  /v My girl has the iPhone 7 but she hates the small screen but loves touch id. So yeah we are upgrading her to the iPhone 8. Is it worth it probably not, but she wants a bigger screen so I'm not going to buy another 7. And she loves the new gold color. /v I have a 6s plus should I buy a 8 l like the 10x too /v What if u use a pop socket? Will wireless charging still work? /v It's ridiculous and insane to upgrade from iphone 7 to the iphone 8. And why apple does't offer the fast charger right in the box.. why should people pay extra money for the charger.. why BT 5.0 when the air pod only support BT 4.2? Mmm /v Love my 6s no need the upgrade /v I don't find the point in buying an 8, when the 10 comes out in November. /v I have a 6s plus thinking about upgrading to the 8 or the 7 plus what do you guys think I should do  /v I'm using a iPhone 5C and that model is not made anymore so... iPhone 8 Plus got my money /v     ......  8 ) /v dat shiny back doe #worthitttt /v Really no /v Youcantaffordit /v iPhone 6s vs iPhone 8/8+/x /v help :) , iphone 7 plus or iphone 8 (normal) ?? /v alcobaca Bubba Burger Decatur /v 7s* /v your trending! /v No /v Its the 7se /v iPhone 6 to iPhone 8 or iPhone 7? /v Screw the iPhone... The Google pixel 2 is coming out soon  /v I have a iphone 6 and about a year ago my phone would just die without a battery charging it. It would go from 100% charged down to 89% within one minute; then just die at 89%. Defiantly getting one of them. /v Apple is loosing it's values trying to be like Samsung...the aluminium finish up until 7 plus felt like an industrial design...it just felt strong..smooth..no fingerprints..\nI just hate the fingerprint smudges on my s8+.. I might get a 7plus in matte black..just for the fingerprint issue\nAnd if you have a 7 plus..there is no need to upgrade! /v Who's watching this video and not bragging about how cool they are for having an older phone? /v is it worth upgrading from sony z3 to iphone 8 ? my sony still work fine but become a little bit laggy sometimes /v NO /v This is basically how all hacking starts. You try a bunch of stuff (like giving a non-integer in this case) to mess with a program or hardware until it starts acting in a way that it shouldn't, and find ways to exploit that. /v This is what I want to see on trending. Not Logan/Jake Paul. /v Next, ask it to divide by 0. /v As usual bout a 3 day delay from reddit /v *as the people here grow colder i turn to my computer and spend my evenings with it like a friend:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzqF_gBpS84 /v I don't get it!! /v what a dumb ass program. /v OK, Alexa, guess my number.\n_1_ No, _2_ No, _3_ No, _4_ No, _5_ No, _6_ No, _7_ No, _8_ No, _9_ No, _10_ No, _11_ No, _12_ No, _fuck this game. It is not fun._ /v Bahahaha wow, what a programming fail on the devs part. That's awesome /v This is my professor! :o /v Now ask if she can list all digits in Pi correctly. /v AI will be the greatest threat to mankind. /v seems about right don't see the problem /v Please wear a condom next time you decide to fuck my brain /v It's amazing your video is trending ^^ /v This isn't exactly special. I'm guessing Alexa picked a number greater than the max value then set it to the max value. (Value being 545387) /v Everyone if you see someone in the comment section asking to sext with you report it lol these bots are getting extremely xD /v Honey, you got a big patch coming /v I never knew wild dogs sneezed to vote. Interesting. /v Alexa was like I don't got time for this shit, yayyy you win /v This guy is my professor /v This is cool and all but I'm distracted by the fact that wild dogs sneeze to vote. /v He found a loop hole /v Why does everyone think this is so amazing it has been a feature on the echo since its release /v Let's face it, Alexa was like ....oh hell no, I'm not going to do this all day. ...You guessed what? ...Yup, you got it. /v WTF has the world gone to?.... On that note this computer is not nearly as big or smart enough to give the right number. It's 42 btw\nEdit: I only know the answer but not the question, come back in a million years and I'll find you the question to the answer :) /v Wait one garsh dang limea bean flipen second. 545387 ISN'T A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 545387!!! /v Except that number isn't BETWEEN the parameters. /v You beat her cause shes a woman  /v ....and a Hacker is born. /v Guess my weight (in US pounds) if my height is 1,700 mm and my BMI is 26.89. (Approximate to the nearest pound.) /v How the hell is this bull shit trending /v wow subscribe to my channel /v Wow, a good video on the trending tab for once /v Does this work with credit card numbers. Asking for a friend /v I literally have no idea why Alexa is so popular and she sounds really boring and mundane like a robot or something I don't get it at all lmao /v And they say machine will take over the world /v lol someone confused maxNumber with correctNumber in the code /v Alexa knows what she's doing, she just doesn't have time to play /v ahahh excellent lol. if you were making a game it would be Random(0,10000) oh yeah I make games. /v Looks like a bad case of integer overflow /v 545387 is not a number between 0 and 545387.. numbers from 1 through 545386 are between 0 and 545387 #SimpleMaths /v I thought I was the only one screwing with alexa looking for bugs, didn't know my CSE professor was doing the same lol /v Its comforting to see that the day machines take over and kill all humans is far far away. /v Wow you read from the dekstop /v Siri would be like  sorry I didn't get that  . /v All you have to do to learn the number is know the algorithm it uses to 'randomly' select the number. That's all he did, it's not magic, he's no genius. /v How does he do it!? /v What's the buzzing sound I hear...? /v Could have just said pick a whole number from 1 to 1 million /v This is actually a pretty easy mistake for the application developer to make. When Alexa responds to an invalid input, the line of code she executes includes variable names to insert numbers into her message. If the developer used num_m for the maximum number you selected and num_n for the correct number, having Alexa execute a line like say('Invalid number, please say a number between 1 and' + num_n) would cause the exact issue shown in the video.\n\nHumans program Alexa and humans make mistakes, so Alexa can make mistakes. /v Plot Twist: The answer was 3.5 /v MY ALEXA STARTED TALKING RIGHT NEXT TO MY DESK IN SYNC WITH THE ALEXA IN THE VIDEO /v It works with any decimal /v IMPORTANT!! Here is a great website to get free bitcoin!  https://goo.gl/wrS1jr /v YouTube, Let's play Guess My Number. /v Maybe you can trick her into sex /v Guess My Number  awesome \nHere is related https://goo.gl/vVAYui /v save nani, beaten dog that needs your help to be able to play again\n gofundme.com/c262qs-save-nani /v not much of a game is it when you play it that way /v *Why the f*ck is this trending?* /v Df /v I'm 24 /v Boi /v Woooooow /v Wtf lol /v Alexa Just Turned Retardaddddant /v U look like quirkology /v Full out rigged /v 69 /v shit got me tweakin /v Hahaha that's awesome /v Hey siri /v 666 /v Actually works! Cool! /v  /v I thought Alexa was gonna say: Sike! I got chu dumb fucc /v x /v *Blizzard plz fix* /v 666k views :0 /v 666k views /v Alexa's a dumbass /v 456 /v Man: Alexa, guess my number. \n\nAlexa: 1984 /v Fucking retarded. /v https://youtu.be/vTSmFqrj4L8 /v 666th disliker is here :) /v Does anyone actually care though /v Alexa, guess my height.... in gummy bears. /v dey took our jobs /v Wow /v Baited /v Lol /v 1000000 and 545387? /v that fucking made me laugh. /v So funny! /v This is cool /v Instructions unclear, dog got stuck in Alexa /v the developer team is about to get grilled tomorrow morning . /v Who else is here on 666k views /v Youre stealing from book of life disney, stop lying to yourself /v The last time Disney made a big music star it became a virus...\nthen came Jake Paul /v i love that song /v The typical music solves everything and is the source of all happiness. I'll watch this movie but I'm not expecting much. /v As much as I love disney films, this is closely similar to the Book of Life /v So is this a spinoff of The book of life? It would be interesting to see an Easter egg or connection this looks interesting. /v Could you imagine Walt's face watching this hahahaha /v Whats the Back ground violin name is?? /v A movie about mexican music, and you play coldplay?  Okk /v My dog's name is Coco /v Looks AMAZING! Will be watching it! :) /v This is so much like the book of life its fuckin insane /v The least they could've done was play Mexican music or music from the movie. Like Como La Flor or something. /v I'm in love with the coco!  /v Oh...my...god\nWhat is Disney getting into the Spic business now.  /v It's like the book of life /v This is deadass just a Pixar version of The Book of Life /v I'll be honest, this looks like it's ripping off the book of life.  Which is not something I thought would ever get ripped off /v ? Wasn't this already a movie? /v Already better than the book of life /v Ummm So was planned before the Book of Life??? Or after? /v Stuff i hear about this movie 1. Book of life ripoff even do its not 2 a lot of donald trump jokes /v Great song selection goes with the movie very well , seems like its gonna be good. /v A pixar movie used to be an event... /v 0:44 It's not a phase I swear Great Great Grandpa! /v What artist is covering Bittersweet Symphony here? /v You definitely copied the movie THE BOOK OF LIFE /v The book of life /v This looks great but why Bitter Sweet Symphony? There are a lot of great mexican songs. I know it's just a trailer but I see it as a missed opportunity :( /v Almost seems like a copy of The Book of Life. idk lots of similarities /v I'm hyped for this. can't wait! /v This reminds me of The Corpse Bride /v Grim, Papyrus, the spooky scary skeliton crew, Jack; Its a skeliton reunion /v This movie definitely is trying to spread Pixar's wings in the culture department. I am not that knowledgeable about Hispanic culture, but this definitely seems worth a try! /v 0:23 my mom to me and my brothers /v The use of Bittersweet Symphony works so well! /v This might be the best animation pixar has done -- the colors and movements are stunning! /v This is like The Story Book of Life, it's pretty much the same concept /v I don't know if I want to see this. Seeing that chancla gave me some painful flashbacks lol /v If this trailer does ant get you hyped for this film, I don't know what will. I am very excited for this beautiful and vibrant film:) #PixarCoco /v I thought all pixar characters are white /v The left will use this as an excuse to erase history. /v Is it me or this movie is somewhat The Book of Life??? /v i never knew the name of the background song starting at 0:35 /v I can't wait to watch this! /v Mexican kid going to the afterlife named\n CoCo\n\nI am already sad /v This is a true homenage to the  Mexican Culture (aside from the Book of Life) and one of the most popular celebration of all which I'm proud to be part of \n\nVIVA MEXICO!!! /v what is that song called playing in the background /v Who's wants an inside out 2 /v Cool can't wait. Subscribe to my page I'm new I'm a singer song writer I'm 19 my instagram is @pauly.riley    :))) /v Isn't this like Rock Dog? /v What's the name of the song for the trailer /v WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY THATS MY SONG /v Kinda a copy cat of the book of life /v This looks pretty good but I'm probably not going to see it. I feel like that's how it is with most people watching this. /v Ahh finally the book of life 2 is gonna come out /v I'm curious which cover of Bittersweet Symphony this is? /v Book of life rip off /v This is pixer book of life rip off\n\nIf no one remembers u in the living world  u will die in the skeleton  relm STRAIGHT  OUT OF BOPK OF LIFE COME ON U CAN'T DEBUNK THAT /v Damn, to see my mothers culture, one in which she tells me lots about, were the festivals are held to emulate what it's like, makes me so damn happy. I can't wait to see this with my family. /v https://youtu.be/r0ULgPbKKuk check out this new music video!!! /v Reminds me of Book of Life, with a sprinkle of Kubo. /v This looks terrible and I'm a big supporter of these kinds of movies but it looks so bad /v Anyone else thinking about Grim Fandango while watching this? /v NETFLIX, DISNEY,  and ALL movies I REVIEW ON MY CHANNEL! IT'S AWWWESOME /v Cant wait to see this in Espaol Latino /v I can't wait for The Book Of Life 2! Honestly, I thought that it didn't need a sequel, personally. But as long as it's handled with care for the first movie, it's gonna be a good addition to the lore. /v This is the second animated film to feature Hispanic culture through a theme of Dia de los Muertos. Is that all our culture has to offer cinematically, Hollywood? /v The book of life part 2? /v This Conan O'Brien biopic looks a bit odd... but I still like it.\n*GO* *TEAM* *COCO* /v Trump's about to deport this movie. /v Its basically saying A Christmas Carol is the same as Bad Santa. The Book of Life and CoCo are examples of the same holiday and the same cultures + rituals. Its about music, celebrating life after death, and expressing that through the art of animation. I'm sure PIXAR will bring their touch of magic that will give it a sense of uniqueness that we are all in love with! /v The grandma is gonna die. Guaranteed. /v Saying that this movie is copying The Book of Life is like saying Home Alone is copying How the Grinch Stole Christmas because they are both about Christmas /v New Vietnam game highlights 60fps on Ultra settings: https://youtu.be/_ChxsVDJt0E /v Pause at 0:21. Remind you of something? /v Lol  /v I like this /v Wow the verve nice touch /v COCO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE /v Thr book of life /v Good job Berkeley Ca...home of Pixar. /v Dumb /v Hitler at 1:58 /v https://www.pointsprizes.com/r/free-paypal-spotify-cards-keys /v Book of life /v Bland /v Can't wait, gonna bring tacos, tortillas, burritos, maracas, guacamole, tiquitos, and a Mexican flag. /v Sombra /v This looks really good /v BEHIND THE SCENEhttps://youtu.be/1Xtkkb8Hfw8 /v I love Pixar so much! <3 /v Looks like some hot garbage /v Trump /v Riveras unite!! /v I bet trump disapproves /v Mexican spirited away /v Es como el libro de la vida 0.o /v Can people stop comparing this to the Book of life already? Two completely different movies...  /v cough Book of life knock off /v But you're definitely Meth positive. /v they're really milking these views with all these videos... /v I kinda want him to die /v I'm glad he's okay but... damn, he's let himself go and it's almost as if he's acting out like that for publicity. He's so whack now...used to love him tho lmaoo /v Trauma.... he has gone through trauma. /v I thought you died of aids already, guess not /v No HIV test is confirmatory, because no HIV test is Gold Standard nor Standardized. You could test positive in Florida and negative multiple times in NYC, or France. Depends on the manufacturer of the test. HIV doesn't cause AIDS anyway. No virus does. Watch the documentary Positively False. /v Wtf is aaron carter, and why should I care? /v This is the first time that I've heard Aaron Carter's name in about ten years. This is unsurprising. /v They need to stop broadcasting this shit for TV and entertainment purposes and help this troubled soul get back to being okay. I hate how these media channels put this shit out like it's about a celebrity or something. He's no different than the lonely soul in the city suffering from drug or sex addiction. The illusion of fame and the culture of celebrity-dom need to be cast aside here. /v Dear people. Check out my latest video WASTED! in my channel. The video features an hour length dance remix set personally created by myself to keep people up and raise fund. The set is comprised of 16 pop/trance hybrid tracks, and the set will give you both both chill and blast. Please share and like the video! Thank you for your time and support!\n\np.s. don't know who Aaron is but hopefully he gets okay! /v Damn i wonder how he was about 5 years ago. A really nice girl i went to high school with apparently slept with him at a college party that was confirmed by a few sources including her brother. Weird.. /v What the hell was he up to that made him so concerned about being sick with something?? scary considering he was just in a long term relationship. If he was unsure he was potentially spreading it around to other people. ew! /v I always wondered wat happen to that 90s kid singer /v WTF?! I thought this had to be clickbait. Is someone finding out if they have a potentially terminal disease 'entertainment'?... /v Aids test negative. Looks like he has aids  positive. /v He looks like he has SOMETHING or is DEFINITELY on something. Damn. /v This going be Justin Bieber in the future /v This guy looks like the poster child for don't smoke crack! you see in police departments  /v What the hell.... I live under a rock..... Had no idea. In my skull this kid was still a kid. /v So much for doctor-patient confidentiality.... /v Seriously what happened to Aaron carter, I mean damn /v Nigga has a pair of yeezys on /v Aaron oh Aaron what are we going to do with you? /v how old is he 49 /v It's sad that he expected to be positive with some kind of std. Tells you a lot about him. /v Who tf is Aaron Carter? /v Woah this is crazy, this dude was like the shit when i was a kid then he disappeared. Good to see him healthy but we gotta get this man some gains. /v Sad the way Satan drags men to such low states, he want to destroy what God created, that's way he send JESUS to this world, just call on Him He will listen and respond, try and see. With all your heart, trust Him. /v Good for you dummy /v I'm 31 and he loooooks waaaay older than me ... /v They should have brought along a drug addiction specialist because they are trained to deal and see beyond this fake, lying bullshit that Aaron is spreading on air that drug addicts are inherently known to do, but then again I don't think the cable station has enough slot time nor would they want him to run off and overdose on skid row because what was being said was too difficult to hear. Addicts either want help or they want to get sober enough to get back to do one more hit that will eventually kill them because their bodies weren't as strong as they were before getting sober. /v He can't believe it. /v Now he needs to eat /v He's such a nasty looking heroin addict /v omg....he looks bad:((...I pray he stays on the right path...before he ends Dead.  Amen....you can do it bro.  fight it!!!!! /v isnt this the dude that sung the liberty kids theme song /v He looks like if Lil peep didn't have any tattoos /v Wow, he looks so fragile......He is wayyy too talented to be on a TV show, revealing to the world whether or not he's HIV positive. Not that it's a bad thing for him to be tested but he should get as much help as he needs in private. They're exploiting him while he's in a vulnerable state and I don't like it. /v BOOM! I PUT IT IN THE HOOP LIKE SLAM!!! /v My god he looks so sick.  /v Heroin transforms people and brings out their dark side. /v And that's how I beat craq /v His reaction was like a father finding out the child isn't his lol /v Why am I NOT buying this hmmm..... /v I still remember when this dipshit was as big as a bieber. God times change! /v who would fuck him he look sick as hell hiv looks like the least of his problems /v Chase that money they would always say. They never told you about all the fucked up things you could come across.  how much it realy cost and the price you pay for the fame. \nchase thay money says the pimp to his hoes. thats how the real story of life goes. /v God damn! He needs to get himself together /v Did he just have sex with bins of used needles? /v stay in school, or you'll get the aids. From doing drugs, unsafe sex, making horrible music. /v Dude something is causing your leukopenia. May not be HIV that kills you, but you look like shit and I think they were trying to tell you your count was super low... /v LOL This guys life is a fucking disaster and people are taking advantage of him. /v As a human I just hate to see him like this after seeing him on TV the same age as me back in the day /v ... and that's how I beat Shaq /v myth of contagion/AIDS/HIV\nno such thing as communicable infectious disease\n(disclaimer: not a Dr. not medical advice) /v He might have an Ulcer, they can cause dramatic weight lose, and they can come about from abusing Alcohol and Drugs. /v Wish he didn't come off so Dis genuine. It's very acting like his reactions /v Is this the guy from backstreet boys, or his brother? /v Why is this on trending!? /v A tragic young man who has an air of looming mortality. He's got the look of meth addiction or liver disease which is why I won't be shocked to hear if his life ends early. /v No meds in 3 days...!? BULLSHIT!! As an ex pill addict (benzos and opiates/opioids) I call total bullshit on that! He'd be so fucking unbareably ill- withdrawals from either, causes SEVERE sickness. He'd be shaking, sweating, puking, crying and NOT talkative, at all! Never trust a junkie! I hope for his sake he cleans up- it's a sad, lonely and degrading life. /v Seems as if his brain is fried... /v Looks like a junkie to me /v Who's Aaron carter? /v Is this the same Arron Carter who sang Looking Through My Own Eyes. The theam song the Liberty's Kids. /v The little brother of the backstreet one. /v HIV is not a death sentence any more.  There are worse things.  People are living healthy on treatment... /v God bless you Aaron Carter. Don't give up. Stop caring so much what people think of you. Blogs, magazines, even YouTube comments...it can mean nothing to you you as soon as you stop reading or watching. Don't fill your head with negativity, you won't be able to fit anything else in there if you do. /v Who cares about celebrities /v Thats how i beat Shaq /v Poor guy /v Aaron Carter, you are HIV Aladeen. /v Well tbtat was bizarre /v His teeth white af tho /v Holy 2000's BATMAN! /v Thought that dude was bye bye bye /v YOU ARE HIV ALADEAN /v Hilary Duff should've never rejected him /v Damn he looks likes skeletor /v intravenous drug use? /v What a queef tard /v wasting /v This ugly ass nigga bruh /v I'm sexy!  /v Who is she? /v This dude a full blown junkie now. /v Who tf /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q54gIP6LK4 LIKE IT /v Tommy Lee banged him, suprised he doesn't have AIDS, Asshole infected dick sucker /v BET YOUR RAGGEDY ASS COULDN'T BEAT SHAQ NOW /v Bieber in 10 years /v Wtf happened to him!! Skinny asf /v Stop having butt sex /v He still has 90s hair /v Damn... was he expecting to have HIV?  /v I'm obviously an idiot. Who tf is Aaron Carter. I've been hearing a lot about him and I've heard the name before but it's just not ringing a bell /v hes a gay boy. stupid fags /v There's more than one way to get hiv people. He was probably sharing needles, looks like a heroin addict to me. /v Improve immunity with Vit D3 supplementation. At least 5,000 IU per day.

Its just a phone, wtf. /v This is y you dont give a white bitch money. /v I'm moving back to Apple with the iPhone X. My last iPhone was the 4S anyways Apple have done a great job of refining the features and design and as always making an amazing camera.  Also will be a reason to pick the series watch 3 after. \n\nGreat hands on video!  /v I love the apple fanatic in you... /v Yasss! operation was successful finally can get my hands on the Iphone 6s #ishit /v im getting iphone 10 when it comes out instead of iphone 8 /v Justine do you know if the iphone 8 has quick charging. I didnt catch it during the keynote. /v Then when the next iPhone comes out for even more!! She'll say WORTH IT Again looooooooool so sad. /v I'm just gonna sit in my iPhone SE corner. /v Well, I have no words, honestly. This is amazing. But it would be hard to choose one of them. They both have new features and upgrades. I think that the iphone x came too early. /v She's appreciating everything.... Someone got paiddddd /v Samsung Galaxy S3 screen resolution which came out in 2012: 1280 X 720p\niPhone 8 (2017) resolution: 1334 X 750 p\nIn 2012 I imagined we would have holographic displays by 2017 and apple can't even put a full HD display in a $700 phone. Wtf /v Still too much edge on the edges and the top bezel or bezeless part is so ugly /v this bitch still not married and obsessed with apple hahahaha /v Bruh my sister barely got the I phone 7 plus last week now she's getting the X I'm like tf wrong with her?? /v I think you are overacting /v Pixel XL 2 or V30 would be a better buy /v So the iPhone X is basically an Android but an apple version of an Android.. /v honestly, the iphone X sounds pointless. i mean yeah its an iphone and shit but i mean.. almost 1k? sorry but no. /v Are ya gonna do an unboxing of all the stuff you got at the store? XD /v Yeah, still here with the iPhone 5 /v I'll stick with my 7 /v Have fun with your new apple. /v I just don't  understand what you mean by Worth it. Let's break it down. It is an overpriced product, like most of everything that Apple sells. It doesn't have any true innovation. The cut out at the top is a complete utter blasphemy for anyone who has a keen eye for design and knows what functionality is and how it works. Without losing any screen real estate, are you for real? With the cut out you loose part of the real estate in mostly anything you do on the phone and you can save the but you can make it smaller so that you don't loose anything on it NO! It's not ideal and it's not functional, so why make the customer do it  when  you could've done it in the design? Augmented reality? That's been done by Microsoft, Nokia, Sony, Google, may I keep going? Microsoft has a whole department on it. Face ID? It's a really risky and bad move from Apple. It isn't even that reliable, can they better it? Yeah, but why get rid of a clearly secure way to secure your phone for something you haven't even perfected? And don't come at me with it was sacrificed for the screen and put more features on it. WRONG! Samsung's Note 8 and S8/+ have the bezeless effect and have Iris scanner, facial recognition, a headphone Jack, a fingerprint scanner on the back and it's IP68, hence on the 68, all on one phone. The LG V30 also has all of that with a quality DAC  on board. So please, do people a favor and actually present products with an honest and not biased opinion. The phone is not worth $999 or up. It's recycled technology, cramped on a shell that has people thinking is a luxury and exclusive brand. It has fast charging on board but you have to pay for it? That's like an $90 charge, extra from the $999 for the base model. The phone doesn't get bright with only like 625 nits on it, the note 8 goes for 1200 nits, Double that!!!!! Is the note 8 worth $950? Yes, but it has way more features, good quality headphones out of the box, better design, functional as well, you don't need to pay for the features. And I could go on... pleaseeeeee do humanity a favor and inform with the truth and don't over hype a product that is not worth the money. You might be able to buy it or probably be able to get it from Apple if they pay you off for a good review, but don't sell a dream for people who don't have the money to bug something overpriced and completely not worth it. /v Silver X can't come soon enough. This 5s needs to retire. /v I can guarantee you she doesn't get this excited about a penis /v Apple wants you to buy their iPhone Xpensive /v Once again, Inadequate technical knowledge , compensated by preety face and expressions. Wanna be nerds ! huh /v they should make a green or blue iphone x /v This is embarrassing. Miniscule update. No phone manufacturer has introduced anything new this year /v It looks like shit, they just added new features.. that could be added in future updates for all other phones. /v i'm gonna draw a face on my penis and no one will ever be able to unlock my phone. /v The thing is...the iPhone X is going to be old next year. /v *You are so beautiful than iphone 10* /v Hi iJustine! Great wrap up of the event and the products! I have the 7 Plus now and when I watched the keynote I became obsessed with the iPhone X! Definitely would not get the 8 Plus considering I don't see the major difference between it and my beloved 7 Plus other than the portrait photos and wireless charging. I thought I would splurge and get the X but now after I've calmed down (lol) I think I am getting the Apple Watch Series 3 instead and waiting for the iPhone XI (?) next year. Just my two pennies. :) /v Did they remove the home button? /v i have an iPhone 6s plus and upgrading to an 8 plus! so excited /v Hey guys, texting you from the future, it's september 2017 now.\nApple still hasn't updated the design, the iPhone 8 looks like an iPhone 7 and even 6 (The borders and case fricking same, just added a dual camera). And they made expensive model just by removing the home button. And making camera vertical, sounds crazy right? But its true, trust me.\n\n\nBtw! Please make a video of IOS 10 on 7 Plus speed performance with a stopwatch, and then update to 11, and see how Apple does make our phones slower, to force us to buy a new model every year! PLEASE- DO iT! /v This was legitimately an awesome overview! Excellent video thank you so much  /v The relationship Apple users like iJustine has with Apple sometimes reminds me of Sheldon and Amy's early start in their relationship. Amy would always wait for Sheldon no matter not getting what she wanted when she wanted it while others around her of a different ilk got what they wanted in a reasonable time frame. She then makes up a convoluted compromise out of hope. Apple users deserve better. They really seem like they're being mistreated and mislead and being given less than what they deserve. Am I wrong? /v I love how we completely skipped iPhone 9 /v Ever since Steve jobs passed away. The only innovation and revolutionary thing apple had been offering on their keynotes is  speech. They sure know how to make an old tech that's been there sounds new . Face recognition, touchID been there . Could've just add those to the 8th or simply bring the X as it represent the 10th anniversary of iPhone . /v aint heard from this bitch since her she wolf parody LMAOOOO /v What if I'm sleep and someone gets my iPhone X and unlock my phone while I'm sleep /v Holy shit... I want it /v I'm watching this video on a iPhone 4 /v i currently have an iPhone 6 plus and i want to get the iPhone X /v Thanks to you. I am sure I love the new iPhone X. I won't get it. Not in my budget. My family comes first. My iPhone 7+, rose gold, will have to hold out for the next model... iPhone xi. LOL.  Thanks for the info. /v What job will Ijustine take if YouTube died?  /v I have the 7 plus jet black should i get the iphone x black also or the white ? /v 999$ for 64 gig no expandable mem and she said worth it? then what you have to sign up momthly to lease 50 gig or more lol /v Sooooo is there not going to be an  9 now lol /v Why is this on trending its just your typical white girl obsessed with every new expensive piece of technology /v They copied samsung so much in so many ways /v No headphone jack??? I'll just stick to my 6s plus /v Well what if you want to use your phone while it's charging? Well you plug it in LMAO BYE JUSTINE /v Imma wait for shane dawsons  conspiracy theory of this shit /v Wait why do all these Youtubers keep their $100000000 phone for like 1 year?? Like seriously y'all are dumb and rich as the kings. My sister has had the same phone for like 3 or so years and hasn't complained. And guess what? It's a 5! Nothing wrong with a 5! Y'all are just spoiled people who obsess over brands. I bet y'all would buy dirt if it was called Apple dirt. And you do realize this has almost alllllll been invented, right? Being able to unlock your phone with your face, rounded screen, no home button, excellent camera, etc. No big does when it was Samsung, but it's a HUGE deal with Apple! This video is for rich and dumb people. /v Who else is watching this and doesn't have a phone and hoping that there mom and dad is watching this to buy it for them, and they never buy it for you. Instead they buy it for themselves! /v Who already has iOS 11 for your iPhone 7 /v It's like she's reviewing the phone without telling the specifications because her audience or not nerds.  .Bunch of blondes that want to know more about the iPhone X but in English  /v For face recognition, Im wondering how are people who get cosmetic or plastic surgery done to their face unlock their phones? /v Nice video/information., I'm certainly thinking about it; using now a iPhone 7+ 256 GB with plenty room left. The wife p/u an S8 and that display is awesome! I'm tempted by the Note 8 since I did have that infamous Note 7 and Samsung's money offer to past Note users. So, still pondering lol!  /v You sold me on this Justine  /v i hate the apple new phone but i love the video of u but not the new iphone /v you are so pretty how old are you and also which one to buy iphone 7 plus or 8 plus please feedback /v I dont trust in faceID, what happen if my girlfriend want use my phone without knowing it and while im sleeping puts the phone in front of my face, could she acces to my phone??? uhmmmm /v How do u take a screenshot on the 10? DFU/recovery mode?????? /v whatever iphone can dO ..\nbut can't satisfie me..\ngoing tO buY galaxy nOte 8 /v Am I the only one that thinks it's way too complicated for an everyday use phone??? /v I LOVE IPHONES SO MUCH BUT DHEY BE TOO XPENSIVE!

Trump is really a racist, and have a lot of racist friends and supporter's. If you support him you may be a racist or a racist sympathizer. /v Never actually confirmed or denied anything,,,, I wonder why ..... /v Sarah Sanders is one classy woman. If I were in her shoes, I'd tear these propagandist a new one, ever single day. I'd come to the podium with stats against their reporting, their networks, their failing railings, their full politi-fact write up, and a record of their continual obsession with false narratives.\n\nEvery sensible person out there who opposed the former president probably wishes they were more vocal about their distain, when they chose to remain respectfully silent (many for the fear of being labeled a racist).\n\nHowever, this past election sounded off to the effect of a nuclear bomb, and somehow, these morons stand around in embarrassment, pretending like they never heard it. That's ok, keep it up! Please, do continue to double down on this failing propaganda tactic...I mean, wonderfully true and reasonable line of logic; I'm sure everyone around the globe agrees.

I thought it was only liberals hurt by offensive remarks?  I thought conservatives hate PC culture?\n\nApparently the right is just a bunch of babies who are happy to point out when the left overreacts, but also hate when people point out that they overreact.\n\nI'm sick of all the hypocrisy /v Jemele Hill is an influential African American figure\n\nYEAH A GRANDIOSE WAY OF SAYING SHE IS A REPORTER,\n\nshe could be a janitor and you could still use those words influential African American figure yes a great janitor figure one of the best! /v This is America world, please read the comments, hypocrisy at its best.

Imgine if Jamele had falsely claimed Trump was not born in the U.S!!! /v a question that hasn't come out yet.  When did racism or being racist ever become solely and diversely linked to only African American ridicule?  Isn't racism everywhere or better yet, isn't racism conveyed both ways?

I find her frankly annoying. But asking someone to get fired because of a statement is just stupid. /v media instigating a race war again /v The Huckabee gene is STRONG!

Blacks want everything given to them and get upset when they aren't treated like kangz. Whites need to have each others back and get over any differences they may have. Whites need to stop worrying about being called a racist as it's a hollow attack. Whites need to forget about white guilt - whites built this nation and have given more to minorities than any other race. These people don't want peace, they want everything and they want whites to suffer. Organize. Share the truth and fight back! Be proud of who you are.

Identity politics at it's finest /v The Russians now he is a white supremacist soon it will be he is a reincarnated hitler robot alien \nLol wtf /v One mental weakness conservatives have is that they believe there is a giant invisible man in the sky. /v No offense, but was she born a man? /v I wonder how bad spicer would have fumbled that, she did pretty bad already. /v Sarah are you a white supremacist? /v oh the irony that you saying that this is a fireable offense is in fact a fireable offense /v Knowi that Trump being a white supremacist is a matter of not being asleep for the last 70 years. /v She's hard to look at. /v Influential African American figures?  Influential?  Nobody working for ESPN is influential anymore.  Nobody. /v Who is Jemima Hill? Does she make pancakes at the plantation kitchen, or just another braindead ape. /v They ESPN needs to bring back Curt Schilling #doublestandards /v Demon-Rats have been controlling minorities for 100 years but when Republican Abe Lincoln defeated them they Adapted from Physical Enslavement to Mental & Fake News CNN & Company is helping them Remember LBJ : I'll have those N*****s Voting Democrat for the next 200 years. /v Pretty soon they're going to start calling M&Ms racist /v Why does the news  reporter in the crowd keep saying influential ? /v Why is this on trending no one cares /v Whaittt powaaaa!!! /v Black Privilege /v she just told that dumbass /v subcribe to my channel /v Sarah Huckabee should be fired. /v This admin sucks ass /v What a dumb bitch /v Trump is a white supremecist /v White Trash Cunt House. /v dump her like spicer. shes a fucking cunt /v SNOWFLAKE. LOL! Triggered ugly bitch. /v Liberals Snowflakes  are TRIGGERED. /v Fuck this dumb Bitch and trump /v Jemele hill is trash /v Jemele Hill is a racist /v Sarah owned this stupid MSM fool! /v Jamele is a black supremacist /v Who the f*ck is Jemele whatever?  Trump making another person famous. She sounds like a black racist. /v Some of you are acting sick. This is a human being you're calling names and demeaning. You can disagree with her, disagree with the people she represents, but at the end of the day, we're all human beings with unique thoughts and opinions. And how long is it gonna take before we understand that again? /v I don't watch ESPN anymore because since when is a sports network political TALK ABOUT SPORTS THATS WHAT YOUR THERE FOR like how stupid is ESPN they recently fired a guy for having the last name lee and it was apparently bad bc there was a confederate Robert E lee who was white and the lee on ESPN who was fired was Asian like he should sue ESPN for discrimination over a fucking last name he had no power in picking this is why America is so apart it's bc the liberals purposely do it and then blame us educated people and trump which btw isn't a racist all people who think he is need to get their heads out of there ass bc everything that the liberals use saying he is a racist is so out of context and misleading /v Say what you will but shes an excellent press secretary /v Jamel hill is a racist no talent hack. /v ONLY TROLLS, BELOW, ARE ON  THIS COMMENT PAGE. /v I wish she would have just said how about espn sucks our fucking dicks, they are lying scum. /v I love how he said the ESPN sportscaster was respected lmao. She was given her latest position because of race and to try to be overly diverse instead of hiring upon talent. She's a low life scum just like the other liberal cry baby's /v Is it any wonder why ESPN's ratings are failing? FOX and NBC sports channels are quickly closing the gap. /v Search donald trump jesse jackson to see what a racist white supremacist he is. /v How does anyone think Trump is competent? /v All these snowflakes are triggered by a black woman speaking the truth. Do you all need a safe space? I thought you guys hated PC culture, she's not being PC here. \n\nAlso what she says is facts. I don't necessarily think that Trump is a white supremacist, but the ignorant idiot did in fact surround himself with white supremacist;  Bannon, Gorka, Miller. Being a white nationalist is just a synonym for white supremacist. Wake up and smell the coffee, snowflakes. /v Fuck you, youtube! /v https://www.gofundme.com/4esiwu8 /v Espn is disgusting /v Look at her lipstick on her lips obvious lmao /v *YOU'RE FIRED* /v Boycott ESPN /v Trump and trump supporters are offended. Fuckinng SNOWFLAKES /v TRUMP 2017 MURICAAAA /v   P A Y  W I T H  Y O U R  F A C E /v No thanks. I will be getting the note 8. /v Gimmicks. One after another. Smart phones have hit a wall. /v was it me or the unlocking feature failed when it was used ( second time ) /v APPLE, stop coming out with a new damn IPHONE /v Legends say the poor gentlemen is still smiling 1:11 /v Chillin with my 6. Sure there are people happy even with a 5 or 5c. First no jack and now no charging port or even a home button? Just keep it simple the way people want it. /v Its just a Galaxy S8 cop out for way more money /v I'd beg on the streets for money to buy this phone, it is just that good. /v The display is manufactured by samsung. Proud with my note 8 /v I'm not going to spend a grand on this shiny potato. /v I never used iphone until now /v But can you throw it at the wall without breaking it? /v Someone grabs your phone\nYou close your eyes\nThey run away /v Cal it the i onlyrichpeoplecanbuythis /v I Thought they learned thier lesson about having a glass back. Honestly apple just skipped over 9 to get here, so im calling this the     I phone 9. /v lol iphone 10? we're still at the 7 bruh /v This is garbage. Never buying Apple again. /v THIS POOR GENTLEMAN FROM APPLE /v imo the innovation on this phone is not worth $1000 /v I'm down for the nicer screen with Dolby Vision and HDR but man....just imagining myself having to pick up the phone off the table every single time to look directly at it when I want to glance over at stocks and e-mail at least 30 times a day.  And let's bring some attention to the notch where the camera and sensors are.  That will block part of your video content. And while Netflix and Amazon Video requires a 4K display to give HDR content, the X not being a 4K display negates its Dolby Vision and HDR10 on this phone. /v Glass back, damn better buy their case, glass no scratch screen protector and warranty and that's over about $1200.00 spent in a day. /v Yah I think I'll stick to my iPhone 6 /v I was thinking why I don't know about this, check because all the videos were only 2 days ago ...oh /v Ok sorry this is so dumb /v Take that android. This iPhone is so much more legit than anything they could make /v Alright tell us how much they paid you /v It's very beautiful, it's insane how far technology has gone /v What the hell happened to 8 and 9?? This is bullsh*t /v So this is real wow /v Note 8 has all this with a bigger screen, stylus and expandable memory. Wtf apple??? You used to be innovative... /v Haha!  The Face unlock didn't work once during this video.  Complete fail. /v If the iphone X gets robbed all the person has to do to unlock it is to get the owner to say CHEESE! lol /v wow   what a great iphone . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n ok ,i choose samsung . /v hopefully they release a iphone 9 with all the same stuff as the X but with a headphone jack and a home button /v everyone i find it stupid of you and you lose all credibility when you speak about the bad things and the bad things only. NO, this is not an s8 with lower resolution display, NO this is not the start of apple removing every port, NO this is not the ishit 8, NO this is not the iphone Xpensive. do your research and complain about actual things like that the new aspect ratio is still very limited in terms of support from developers, the weird banner creates issues s does the fact that its a new design and it has no touch id and unproven face id. please just do some research before you make more people think you're idiots, all your doing is damaging yourself when you do that. thank you have a nice day. /v Apple is killing us with these phones /v can u unlock it with your face in the dark? /v *someone takes your phone and points it at you to unlock it* so what do you do? Close your eyes? But now while you're eyes are closed they can just leave with your phone. Great job Apple /v Would it still be able to scan my face if I am in the dark? /v How much battery it will be? /v Im watching this on my s8 XD just saying /v im sorry but this is so stupid. are they gonna take away the screen next /v So where's Siri then?????? /v Like the Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. Hmm  nothing new /v Good point. That's a huge security problem - someone just needs to point your phone to your face to unlock it. And Face ID looks to take a bit too long anyway to register your face. I prefer Touch ID. I don't want to have to position my phone in front of my face and wait in order for it to unlock. The quick read on my fingerprint is more than enough and safe. /v I took out my samsung s8 and said to my friend that I got new iphone x.... he believed me. Either Iphone x sucks or I need to get new friends... or both /v honestly iPhones are looking more and more like androids... /v iPhone 20:\n\n no home button\n no headphone jack\n no camera\n no battery\n no apple logo\n 4k screen\n more pointless updates\n built in pop socket\n $1000\n\n /v lol I'm balling out with the x. Getting a 256g, a bunch of cases. Wireless dock when it comes out and a bunch more. But my wallet is going to cry /v How do I go about selling my kidney /v What ever happened to progress... 12 megapixel caneras still! How cute /v I literally just upgraded from a cracked iPhone 5 to a iPhone 7 and now there's an Iphone 10......... /v iPhone 8\niPhone X\niPhone XI\niPhone 1100\niPhone 2x-5=21\niPhone sqrt(12.25*16)\niPhone X + 1/2(iPhone X)\niPhone $16k price tag\niPhone 7th prime number\niPhone product of the numbers we skipped\niPhone Footlong\niPhone whoops we made it too big it's just an iPad now /v 6k poor communists dislike this. Communists with money love an iPhone. /v What if you look like a totally different person without makeup on /v Ohh looks like is time to sell my other kidney. /v I kinda just prefer the iPhone to be more simple ya know with the regular head phones slot, the finger print scanner, or just manually putting in the password for a lower price /v I'm not paying $999 dollars for something i'll break after I drop it 2 feet from the ground once /v I Wish I had money /v not much to be hipped up about it from what i see . My 6 plus is just fine /v Apple is history.  There will be no more innovation.  Only people abusing the remains of a business structure for wealth.  Probably partying it up. /v i like my home button  /v Jesus Christ 1000$ are they insane? /v Would you rather get 1 billion dollars or get a free iPhone X? /v why this guy keep saying super beautiful? Something wrong with his eye?  it is ugly design, too bulky, the borderless is not borderless, there is thick line on side of screen. /v Then face unlock has been around for years. I have an old galaxy from a few years ago that does the same thing......How original...... /v So that's the phone that costs more than a 1000. I don't see anything special about it making it worth the price. /v Who put the apple on that Samsung galaxy 6. /v Hey guys I just thought of a really funny joke on my own: iPhone Xpensive. Get it???  /v iPhones are for simple people. /v Introducing the new iPhone 20 with 6 cameras and new x-ray vision \nOh you liked the lock button to bad now you have to swipe from the right side \nYou liked the volume buttons to bad now you have to swipe to the left\n\nLadies and gentlemen I present you the future for iPhones /v While Apple is happy to make use of free software to construct its operating system, almost all of the software distributed with its devices is proprietary.

You know. The face ID. /v I already broke it just by looking at it. Glass galore. /v What if someone in your school steals it and goes to your Instagram or Facebook or even on Snapchat with a picture of your face can they unlock the phone like that? /v *what* *happened* *to* *iphone* 9?? /v R.i.p Steve jobs vision /v my 6s slays this /v Visita mi canal :3 /v More Apple trash. . .  /v 2:10  /v These phones get uglier and uglier /v Hahahahahahaha apple is a joke. /v Its shiney /v Iphone Xpensive /v IPhoneXvideos /v Damn $1000 bucks /v https://www.gofundme.com/4esiwu8 /v I hate iphone i love samsung /v It looks terrible /v 9? /v so is the iPhone 9 gunna be nonexistent ? /v samsung is way better /v BRUHHH NOW THE HOME BUTTON /v IPhone x means iPhone xpensive /v I still have iPhone 5s ... /v BUT IS IT ONELESS /v I guess you could say it's....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPENSIVE BUAHAHAHAHA. I'll just leave now /v plagiarism samsung! /v Anyone else have something in their eye? /v I can't remember if I found her on NPR's tiny desk concert or Audiotree. My favorite version of Rejoice is on Audiotree. /v Think we're up to Sad Song #42 /v I still don't remember how or when I discovered Julien Baker but I do remember that it was at a time when I needed to. I can't imagine not knowing her music exists......I'm glad it found me. /v She's so beautiful!!!! /v Pleasantly reassuring to see that the new album will pick right up where Sprained Ankle left off. If it were possible, I would have worn out my digital copy of Sprained Ankle, I listened to it so much. /v I watched this video 10 times already and I still can't get enough /v I love this more than anything /v This is a godsend. There's no other explanation. /v Julien Bakers music has me in perpetual emotional nothingness /v Please marry me Julien! /v I thought just the song was heartbreaking, this puts it on a new level :( /v I felt wet through my shirt, before I knew I was crying.  It just won't stop. /v This is the best Hyundai commercial ever!!! /v Is she trans? She has a male build and male facial features. /v Did whoever make the video, get inspired by tricky? /v I thought this song was called Apartments on Spotify lol /v Cool! Subscribe to my page just songs I recorded on my iPhone nothing serious my listen I just posted some I did today  :)) /v How does a vid with 10,000 views become 28 on trending? /v Help my channel and subscribe   /v I love you Julien. Write me gychka.a@gmail.com /v Yassss a video! I've been jamming on Spotify for a month now /v This is such a beautiful song, and I love the video. I really think Julien's going to hit it big with this new album. /v Music for the meek. /v I am not joking when I say that I broke down in tears. This was absolutely beautiful. /v thank you for being who you are /v god she's so beautiful. this is beautiful. /v WOW. Literally had this song playing on spotify close the the final act where the tension is building before the song got really emotional and she starts raising her volume just as I scroll down in trending of youtube to see this new video! BTW I'm glad this kind of music is still valued and posted on front page of youtube :) /v Tearing up from the song and looking at the comments and realizing that the same thing happened to others. You guys rule. /v oh. this. is. so. so. so. so. so. so. spectacular. /v let me know when d song starts.. brb going to get a drink /v Seeing this on the trending page is making me so happy! An artist like Julien deserves unfathomable recognition! Much love Julien! /v me: i'm going to mind my own business \n\nalso me: 2:53 - 3:06 /v WELL... I guess I'm going to cry myself to sleep tonight. /v I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying! /v First time I heard her and I knew she had it in her! /v Is anyone else getting an under water effect on the video or is that my tears /v I swear I get the chills every single time I hear her voice. I'm in love with Julien's soul. /v Hey Julien, thanks for being part of the best album of 2016; Touch Amor's Stage Four is the goat. /v You've done it again. Brilliant. /v i'm staying in tonight...\n\n\nyou know what to do ;) /v She was in my recommendations and i was like why mot and i think im in love /v Absolutely beautiful, no other words for it /v So beautiful and serene! Almost like post-rock, in a way. I feel like her 11/29 show is gonna be nothing short of that :) /v it seems to me that this video is about the beauty and grace (dancers) that we see in the world all the time, but is hard to feel or react to in most situations. even when we do feel it, in places where we feel most comfortable (bed) or where the beauty is most encompassing (beach or some other natural wonder), its touch is fleeting. but the fact that it is present and tangible at all provides enough of a reason to keep moving.\nregardless of meaning thank you julien for continuing to share your vision with us :) /v Goodness... I cant decide is I want to lay down and cry or go give her a hug... /v A song that touches you as a person. Amazing stuff.\nOdd that last night I was laying down on the ground on a blanket, wrapping myself up as well.\n\nThank you Julien. /v Trending /v Right in the feels. /v I needed this <3 /v KILLING THE GAME!!! /v omg. beauty... /v Nice sound /v So authentic /v Amazing /v Beautiful /v 4:00 really hits /v Damn Onions  /v Im,earlier then usual /v love u /v  /v Love you Julien  /v mood. /v she so hot /v wow. goosebumps. Thanks for this. /v oh julien.. /v Metaphors man!! /v Eveytime I hear her voice I get misty eyed ugh /v I'm listening to this while my boyfriend is telling me he's done with me, he's sick of my mental health issues... what a coincident  amazing song though, I can't wait to see you in November. I'll probably cry during the entire set  /v I like your watch. /v Wow so raw and hauntingly beautiful! I love it! This is what music is all about! Thank you!!!!  /v YES! I'm so happy for her. been waiting for this for ages! /v You are the best  /v It's true..the ghosts follow you everywhere you go /v So good! Come to south Florida Julien! /v what's up with autumn 2017 and all the amazing new music releases? thank you, talented musicians! You are saving my life with every one of these <3 /v That line, maybe the emptiness is just a lesson in canvases just echoes in my head often. I suppose that I take it as always being able to start over because you can always paint over your work on a canvas, change something to make it new, look at it from a different perspective. Or how from rock bottom, you can only go upwards. With a clean canvas, you can decide to paint the same thing again or something different and that freedom is the line between accepting as things are or trying to change. Idk, but Julien you're brilliant. Keep up the amazing work /v Julien! I love your music. Sometimes my friends make fun of me for listening to female singers, but in all honesty I don't care. Beauty is blind. Thank you so much. /v always amazed by your talent and your way to bring emotions to the surface. /v Don't mind me, just wanna leave a comment to make sure that I was here before the hype broke out. You are amazing Julien! /v Julien is the feel in person /v I love this woman /v I really love JB, I would like to see'er perform live, but it's kinda hard since I don't think she would come to Mexico... /v oh sick, i've been goin thru the shit depicted in this video in loops, although no one dances in my case and i rarely look up, but yeah pretty accurate /v  /v I'm shaken! /v wow... just wow /v Beautiful /v True artist /v Oh geez. My . /v Holy...  \n\nAbsolutely stunning. /v MY EARS BLEEED (and how is this trending with only around 18k views) /v This makes all you cry?..... you guys are PUSSY'S, how the fuck did I get here?, if you played this in ''the hood, you more than likely gonna catch some lead /v subscide to me for 1 million dollars /v Well this sucked. /v Julien Baker music in BoJack Horseman will be something else; would leave just about everyone broken and weeping. /v Amazing voice\nWhich I can play it again and again /v Pure beauty and creativity  /v this voice <3\ngoosebumps all night at berlin with you /v I hate it when you fall in love with an artist and it makes you want to hurt the dickhead fuelling the pain for these wonderful heartfelt songs /v PLEASE chris. Do a spoiler review. This thing deserves to be talked about in extent. /v 0:17 DAMN RIGHT STUCKMANN!!! /v Wow, Mother is a great film /v Not a horror movie. So much religious imagery and wording, literally every event parallels with something biblical or comments on the folly of humans. I couldn't figure out the bleeding hole tho, and didn't realize her role in relation to Javier God until watching this /v Saw the film before hearing stuckmann's interpretation. It was cool to come to the same conclusion as him. There were some very specifics analogous representations and actions that enforced the film's central concept that leave a lot to dissect /v I watched this with a friend tonight. We were talking about it after, and we both had come to the same realization about halfway through, which is that we both wanted the movie to end. It made me really uncomfortable, I don't know why. /v Can you do a spoiler review? /v Ed I have not hairis? /v I saw this movie, when it was called 'ROSEMARY'S BABY!' /v Chris Stuckmann sure does give a lot of A's...sometime I think he is becoming way too lenient. He can't even express the reasons why he gave this movie an A- other than it will make people talk. /v l,awrence is the most overrated actor right now. She needs to complain more about trump causing hurricanes and then we will know what she is really like xD... an idiot /v This Movie Is The Film Of 2017. Bar Fucking None. /v Embarrassing storytime:  Just saw Mother! this evening. In the final minutes of the film, I found myself so nauseous that I had to get  up and leave to go to the bathroom. When I got to the bathroom, I couldn't even unbutton my pants, the room was literally spinning. I peed all over the bathroom floor. The nausea in the film carried over to me. I had a breakdown in the bathroom asking people for help (No one helped me, I looked like a nut job). I could not even drive and was sobbing in the park lot for a queasy ten minutes. A film has NEVER done that to me. I have NEVER been shaken up like that. From an outside perspective, I kept asking myself why was I so upset? I'm into horror movies and the goth and the macabre. The investment and the camera work I think was what pulled me in too deep and thus triggered my very first panic attack. I've never even really believed in panic attacks because I have never had one. Until now. Despite some overkill and high and mighty horses the direction was off the charts and the acting swallowed me up.\nI am not a sensitive person to religion or gore per say but I am still jarred by the way I responded to this movie. Damn you, Arronofsky. /v This movie was a complete disaster. Incoherent and rambling from start to finish. /v Man, I'm gonna go see this tomorrow. This review is hyping me up so friggin well lol /v I just saw the movie.. SOMEONE EXPLAIN IT TO ME IM SO CONFUSED /v Wrong! God does NOT ignore the Earth!! He created it, He would never ignore it!! /v No! barden is ego driven man who thinks hes god. but i loved the film, and i decided to see the film halfway through the first time i watched this review. im back right after seeing it, and watched the rest of your review. its a great movie. thanks for the impetus to see it immediately. its aranovskys best. hes at the top of my list now. i guess he takes andersons place after the inherent vice misfire /v I saw this movie before your review and I thought it might represent the cycle of fame as well. When it restarts at the end it could mean the start of a new star's career. This is probably gonna be on my personal best of the year list. /v Can you post those press notes somewhere? please! /v You convinced me to go watch this alone. Can't wait! /v Jennifer Lawrence is very unlikable. She seems so arrogant and covers it with a veneer of being down-to-earth /v Mother looks like the ultimate mind smash which says a lot because It Comes At Night had me confused/angry/inspired for days. /v I've noticed lately that Chris seems to be becoming more and more well spoken. The last several minutes of this review were all from one take, which is not only impressive from a language point of view, but really refreshing amongst a sea of jump cut laden videos. Chris is articulate and confident enough in his speech that his videos always seem super well put together and relaxed at the same time. /v Let's keep it simple and end the confusion. This movie is an adaptation of the Book of Genesis. I wish the director would just say that because it is not like a lot of people know the bible. I think people would have less of a problem with the film if they understood the crazy source material, the bible. /v SPOILERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhenever Chris said that JLaw's character's name is Mother and Javier Bardem's character's name is Him, I instantly knew that Mother represented Earth & Him represented God. No joke /v Nothing more artistic than breaking an infants neck while it urinates in fear suspended over a mob that proceeds to butcher the babies body and eat it.  Pure art.  How about just another soulless liberal Hollywood fucktard filming ISIS inspired snuff films. /v Please do a reaction/review of the new disaster artist trailer!! /v Chris, with your appreciation for creative narrative structure and story telling, I highly recommend checking out and reviewing The Wailing, a film by Na Hong-Jin. It is definitely something you would enjoy. I love your reviews and analysis, thank you for doing great work! /v Are you going to review Tulip Fever? /v I was so fucking confused but intrigued by this movie. Lawrence and Bardem nailed their performances though. /v Why some people felt offended by this movie?? Is it against catholics or something like that? /v I think Lawrence is representing God and Bardem is the devil. He's a guy that falls from grace and she gives birth to a savior who is torn away by the world. /v I grew up with a mother. /v  *Mother! 2017 Movie Is a remake of Rosemarys Baby, Can it be? *REVEAL HERE: ***http://bit.ly/2xocb24* /v My mind was fucked so hard after watching this movie /v Spoiler, although the film touched on many complex themes, it was simply obvious that every thing that entered their house expoilted it in some fashion. That's all that that needs to be understood. /v So apparently after making Noah, Darren Aronofsky starting to write a children's movie but he gave up and wrote this movie in just 5 days..... Okay. /v Chris, I genuinely hope you read this comment. The whole movie is a biblical allegory. Literally everything that happens in this film happens in the bible, but Aronofsky tells it from an outsiders perspective, with us following God and his endless search for love and understanding from those who cannot love or understand. His study represents the Garden of Eden, his crystal represents the fruit that Adam and Eve (Michele Pfieffer and Ed Harris) destroy. Then he shuts everyone out of the Garden. Plus he gets into a very interesting criticism of God himself, almost making him seem as an arrogant, ignorant fool ... I hope you read this and it made some degree of sense. I'm putting up an in-depth review on my channel soon, I'd love it if you checked it out /v Great review, Chris!! Just saw the movie, and yeah....This movie is basically a really effed up adult version of 'Moana' /v I just left the theater and imo this is the dumbest movie i have ever seen, i understand the movie but its just soooo dumbbbbb. lol im sorry /v ok I dont wanna be that guy but he did use like the same fucking poster I can see the plagiarism right there. /v I love weird and thought provoking movies... I know that some movies are weird for the sake of being weird but I like submerging myself  into a weird meticulously crafted world /v Ok here is what I know. This movie is bat-shit crazy. I mean all over the place, tense, but also has a lot of meaning, but on the surface you are like WTF IS GOING ON. The previews really have nothing to do with the movie. I would venture to say that most people will hate this movie. And just a prediction...but I will say this is going to bomb at the box office. I need to process this movie. /v Chris, you hit the nail on the head! After leaving the movie, I was thinking very deeply about what Aronofsky was trying to get across with this movie, and I couldn't decide whether it was about religion or about mother earth. However, I saw themes reflecting both. Maybe it's a battle between religion and the harsh truth that we are abusing mother earth, sometimes in the name of religion. /v I'll gladly take those screening notes from you. I just got out of a screening of the movie and I'm not sure if I entirely liked it or not. When the film ended I turned to my friend and said  the folks on the interwebs are going to have a fun time solving this puzzle /v So we're all still pretending that Jennifer Lawrence can act? Okay, just wanted to make sure. /v Chris I love your reviews but I'm baffled you gave this an A-. I love Aranofsky films but this was just so on the nose. It lacked a plot. It has no score. The acting made me LOL several times especially Harris/Pfeiffer. When it was all over I literally wanted to run as far away from this. I'll never go to the cinemas to watch another DA film. I've lost all trust in him as a filmmaker. Requiem, Black Swan and The Wrestler all have arcs, plots, and characters you fall in love with. This film is just an art house mess masquerading as religious allegory. \n\nRegards :) /v I can't stad Jlaw. I think she's overrated. I'll skip this one. /v About 4 mins into the video---good review so far.... right now...all I can think of is something like Mulholland Drive. /v I think we should just be friends.......Mother! /v I REVIEW ON MY CHANNEL! IT'S AWWWESOME /v Man, I really do not like Jennifer Lawrence. Just watch RLM talk about her. They get it. /v For the first time i stopped watching a movie review once you said .. come back after you see it.  I'm very curious to see it now. Will come back to listen to your view of it. /v Thanks for that review! I was on the fence about seeing it, but now plan on going tomorrow. Also looking forward to The Disaster Artist. Hope you get to that one as well! /v I'm sure Jennifer Lawrence is a nice person, but she is way overrated as an actress. /v First video of his I've watch on a scale of 1-10 how accurate is he /v Watching Requiem for a dream, I always just sit at the end I don't move, Arnofsky  has a way of doing that /v Is it illegal to have sex with your neighbours dog? /v breaking news Jennifer Lawrence gets hated by because of all the disrespectful comments on trump !\n\nme: *watches so many dank memes of Donald trump* grab her by the pussy? Wow he must hate cats XDDDD /v Do a mother! explained video, or at least a spoiler review /v Lawrence is from Kentucky where i am in fact louisville ky /v wow this sounds like this will deffineely be up for picture /v 6:33 Chris, that's an Evangelion reference not Rosemary's. /v Esoteric. Jay's Analysis would be a good place to follow up on the esoteric meaning behind this film and others. I am not shilling. Not the guy's friend or anything. Just passing on a good lead to follow. Peace. /v picked up on that in the trailer. and im pretty spot on from what I have been told xD /v Sooooo... Basically it's a crappy movie that has no real point. Got it. -_- /v I read an article explaining the meaning of the movie that made it seem really simple.  Here's the link, but bellow is a TLDR. https://www.bustle.com/p/the-meaning-of-mother-will-make-perfect-sense-to-anyone-whos-read-a-certain-famous-text-2336644  Spoilers, obviously.\n\nThe movie is a straight literal allegory for history as portrayed by Christianity.  Him is God,  mother is Mother Nature and later Mary, the house is the world, the first guest is Adam, the second guest is Eve, the sons are Cain and Abel, the baby is Jesus, the cannibalization of the baby is the communion.  Various other characters are allegories for other bible stories.  The ending is an allegory for apocalypse, and this is where it finally breaks from the straight allegory and basically says that instead of God bringing his faithful to heaven he'll just let them die and start a new world. /v Am I the only one who thought this movie was utter trash? /v It's a metaphor for how Hollywood creates sub par crap that everyone goes to see, that it crushes any indie movie /v You can see it as God, Mother Nature. But to me I also see it more simply as fame/Hollywood as Bardem and Lawrence is the embodiment of actors themselves. People in this comment section further prove the point of the film, where people adore the art of the artist but neglect the human behind the art. People take the artists creation and tear it apart to satisfy themselves. There's even a couple scenes representative of any given comment section where people are in battle. Then once they've taken all they can, a new actor comes along to replace them. I think it covers my view and your view in a weirdly effective way. I could not think of a better time for JLaw to have taken this role, oh the irony of reading these comments after seeing this film, I would hope it gives people some new perspective on fame and celebrities. It tackles a lot of themes and ideas that would be more clear on a second viewing. Interesting to see how mainstream audiences react to it, it's a doozy for sure. /v its the oppisite of rosemarys baby its jesus and mother marry and god and the people represent flawed humans that we must love unconditionally anyway and the whole idea of Christianity is a game i feel like god is in love with being loved and creating and recreating the movie was fucking incredible /v i waited to see your interpretation after & its verbatim how i saw it. incredible movie. very slow at times but so deeply symbolically rewarding /v I came to the same conclusion you did as I drove home after the film.  I forgot the brothers but I completely agree.  Such a great film.  Great review by the way! /v I liked this movie. It's very unconventional and actually wants to be thought provoking, as opposed to being mindless entertainment that you can just enjoy and move on from. There were a lot of things explored, some that were obviously religious and political but others I'm still trying to figure out. \n\nI also like how divisive this movie is being. Some are loving it, while others are calling it pretentious or even garbage. /v Aronofsky knows how to amp up tension through out a film to the point where you feel like your heart is going to explode. Requiem did that, and so does this film. /v I just watched mother! Chris, and I agree with everything you said about the film. I guarantee that not everyone will like this film. Some might call it ambitious, while some might call it pretentious. After watching mother! in theaters, I'm more on the spectrum of people praising the movie. While I do find the message to be obvious, the way Darren Aronofsky directed it was insane. I was left in shock after it ended. I'm surprised that it took Aronofsky 5 days to write the script. Like I said, a lot of people won't like this movie, and I respect your opinion. But to me, I found mother! to be unique. /v Today's society is so weak - they get offended by everything. Idiots. /v Didn't the director say explicitly that it's based on Rosemary's Baby? I don't think he's trying to plagiarize, I think he's paying homage. /v Honestly I would have liked it better if they didn't advertise it as a horror movie. but overall it was good /v *THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING THINGS I  HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE * AN ABSOLUTE MUST WATCH.\nIF THIS MOVIE AND JL DOES NOT GET AN OSCAR - I AM SUING ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE GOING AUDIENCE COMMUNITY /v I appreciate you admitted you were affected and at times confused by Mother!, Chris.  Too many critics act as though they are the smartest guys in the room and everybody else is a moron.   I also appreciate you avoided any spoilers.  Have you seen  Aranowsky's  Requiem For A Dream?  It's great, but I have to let years pass before I can watch it again. /v Mother!  was shit /v Great review, Chris! /v Can we get a tattoo review? cuz whaaattt.....? /v Sweet /v 27th on Trending!

Double standards much??? /v Not cool!!! Talking down to a security guard, who is ensuring your safety, as if he's a kid!! Boooo Bella! Booo! /v Grabs him forcefully, please don't touch her! /v Queen Bella doth protest her minions. Security guard is in the right /v How about the scumbucket media and papanazi back TF off? These people are professional photographers, they know when they are too close. How about some personal responsibility, get out of the way or get roughed up. It's her own fault fml /v What a fucking CUNT! Why is she famous? You all are pathetic humans if u like her. /v So these security guards can push people but if cops do it or secret service does it its brutality and abuse. /v I don't get it, he was doing his job. /v So many offended men in the comments omg /v Every time that stupid TMZ song comes on at the end I click any video to immediately stop it. /v For all the men getting pissy in the comments about the difference in treatment between men and women. We know. Unfortunately life's not fair. /v I don't see why this got so many men's gears going , like can one of y'all explain /v I wish we had a better angle of what happened. The biggest difference I could see was that the female was knocked off the curb and wasn't physically blocking her path. /v But if that photographer had bumped into her or injured her, she would have had her security guard fired.\nBitch, do you want your security to do their job or not?? /v This what happens when you idiots praise these these hoes. They feel like they're above others /v This dumbass sees hundreds of dudes getting roughed up and only says something when a woman is in the exact situation... can these celebrities get bent already? /v Really? They did the same to everyone but as soon as he pushed a girl oh no what a bad man bitch stfu /v Male security/body guards should refuse to work with Bella Hadid.  Use all female body guards and see how that goes, bitch. /v So does tmz not have anything but phone cameras? /v Cool! Subscribe to my page just songs I recorded on my iPhone nothing serious my listen I just posted some I did today  :)) /v Really?  Fuck you.  This is why I can't get down with this super feminazi movement /v Oh look at me everybody! I'm so edgy and like totally standing up for women's rights and stuff  /v All you little damn feminist don't get it. The security was doing their job. It don't matter if you're male or female. If you're in the way of the person you're suppose to be guarding and you've been told multiple times to move, expect to get pushed. All of you are getting pissed just because she's a girl but she barely got pushed. Don't be a little bitch because a girl was trying to get up close to take pictures of a celebrity when they know they can't get close. End of the damn story. /v good for you bella. just good. the lack of basic humanity in these comments is unreal. /v She would get knocked tf out by that security guard then his life would be ruined even if she was the one that first hit /v Who the fuck is bella hadid? /v Who the fuck is she? /v Well now there's gonna be only female photographers, clearly they can get as close as they want /v Did she just assume her gender??!! /v I have no clue who Bella Hadid is but I doubt this was a noble act it was more then likely her trying to keep from getting sued. /v Who the fuck is Bella hadid? /v I'm not a feminist or care about the politics it's involved in.  Some feminist are annoying but I rarely see them make videos or post on videos that have nothing to do with feminist.  So I find it funny and ironic that the most annoying people are the ones who criticize feminist and the anti feminist, PC, SJW crowd.  Seriously, most you guys do is bitch and moan about feminist on videos that have NOTHING to do with feminist.  Pick a random YouTube video and there's a 85% chance there's losers bitching and moaning about feminist, PC or SJW.  It's pathetic and annoying as f*ck.  \n\nCan someone answer a question?  Why do you guys care so much?  Is this going to effect your or the life of your family and friends?  I just see SO MANY videos by anti feminist, PC and SJW guys.  And they comment (bitching and moaning)  EVERYWHERE!  Look at the comments here.  Just guys crying more then the feminist do.  And over the smallest little shit.  Some of you have to admit that it's getting out of hand.  Just bitching to much. /v Yall niggas is butt hurt like yall were pushed or something. A man shouldnt put his hands on a female thats why she said something tf DUHHH /v I mean, the men can handle pushing, but YOU NEVER HANDLE A WOMEN LIKE THAT. Where are your morals? /v Okay y'all need to chill. We all know physically men are stronger they guard was built the guy he pushed wasn't a small guy. The female was a smaller and he shouldn't use that much force with a woman. /v What a dumb bitch, you hired him as security and now you publicly embarrassed him, you feminist whore bucket /v Seeing all the bitchy MRAs in the comment section shows why no one takes male victims seriously. /v She's sweet though lol /v Take a shit on those shits. /v You can barely see what's going on...maybe if you didn't film this in portrait mode /v lol, this girl will be crying one day when she needs security /v Female tribalism doesn't seem to me to be about equality. I didn't see what the security guard did but it seems that the security guards push everyone blocking their path out of the way and some of them are females. There doesn't seem to be an easy way around that, maybe security agencies should reject contracts with clients who are tribalistic. /v the joke is this girl with no education and zero talent is surrounded by five bodyguard !\ni mean beyonce the superstar but i always see her with that bodyguard of hers who even was in the elevator\nbritney had that big black one \nso why in the hell is a mere instagram posing chick surrounded by five as if she was a huge deal smh\nplus he was screaming and pushing males and she liked it then pretended to be a feminist and defend the woman smh /v So she shames the security guard for doing his damn job and putting his life on the line for your bitch entitled ass ....Sick and tired of these females feeling so entitled these days try grabbing me like that why don't you.... /v Oh I wish I wish i was the security guy being manhandled by Bella.As soon as Bella shoves me, i would have punched her really really hard and scream -I QUIT YOU LOSER-No girl can shove me like that in public and scream obscenities /v He's doing his job, no? /v Can y'all shut up? Fucking people who have no hearts. She just didn't want that women to be pushed as hard as the men are. Probably because it would hurt more. So shut up. /v So a video of a random celebrity getting slightly mad over a petty thing is consider news? Perfect. /v Guards push males\n*bella sleeps*\n\nGuard push female\n*BELLA MORE WOKE THAN JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF* /v That was NOT a rough up. /v Who the fuck is this hooker bitch? /v should keep quiet and not tell the person  protecting you how to protect you,  especially when hes equally roughing up people and if its because men are use to it /v When is TMZ going to get rid of the stupid black bar scratch filter on the sides of it's videos. Do they not realize YouTube has a feature to make vertical recordings full screen and those scartched up black bars fucks that up? /v This would have been avoided if the paparazzi female was not in the path of the celeb and,  her escort staff  for about  , the whole minute. /v what sjws don't know is that by them doing this shit they are creating  more sexist people /v Way to go for publicly putting down your security. /v I swear if paparazzi's followed me around I would be so pissed. /v Pushes several men *I sleep*\n\nDoes the same to one female *WOKE* /v Learn to record horizontaly you collection of fucking cucks calling themselves a news site. /v Here, I fixed the title for you:\n*useless shit* /v Fuck Bella Hadid and the paparazzi and you thirsty celebrity worshippers;) Get a life and live it to the fullest. Stop worrying about this stupid shit;) /v She's tougher than her security guards /v I smell an extremest of feminism /v Hehehe. She said, Please don't touch her, while she was doing her own touching. Looks like she wants it both ways. /v Lol she doesn't mind him pushing the males though. Turns out, women and men are different, but I mean, did anyone believe they were the same? Except for stupid feminists idiots. /v MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! /v stupid humans /v Who is she ? /v Mm, rough. /v Someones gonna get fiiireeeed /v  /v That's it? /v Equal rights my ass /v Fucking feminist /v Trump snowflakes are offended by the mistreatment of the asshat dude, such crybabies. /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q54gIP6LK4 LIKE IT /v I'm living /v The cringe /v Misleading title /v This is crazy. /v bella heedeed is def gon get shot indeed /v Equal rights right fucking cunt /v I feel sus watching this, *dislike* /v SMH /v What an unintelligent cunt. (Bella) /v Aggressive much ! /v Fake news /v This staged /v TMZ roughing up YouTube with this click bates /v Fuck bella and fuck that bitch /v The guy touched the female photographer in the top part, so the breast. I am pretty sure that if the security guy was touching the photog guys down there ( in the big cojones) she would also step in.  So all you whiny Male 4 Male knights of the PC culture just move forward. She did a kind thing, don't be jealous. /v I love how she bounced back quickly after her best friend stole her man.. Now she continues to win. I wonder that chick is at now? /v People kill me like what they see on the gram actually represents real life  /v Her last album was really good very underrated. /v Who finds Laura stylez boring as an interviewer, plus her laugh   so annoying /v Shout out to big areolas /v Body talk, workout and diet starts 12:50 /v Her genetics!!!!! Ugh I hate her.   /v Tey stopped by hot 97 to talk about what's relevant......Her body /v New york folk are always funny to me. The accents, the mannerisms, it never ceases to make me laugh.\n\nHearing her hard core demeanor talk about her breastfeeding woes was hilarious. /v TEYANA IS BOMB AF. LOVE HER PERSONALITY! AND SHE BIRTHED HER OWN BABY! YAS #UNASSISTEDBIRTH IS EVERYTHING! MAGICAL! /v Sooooo nobody could've been a real one and gave the time of when she started talking about her boobs?  /v what the fuck is going on here? /v https://youtu.be/3Tead1j2fHs\n\nIn This Week's Episode We Get Into My Great D.

The doctor that fixed her facial features did a great job. /v 41 in Euro size is a 7 1/2 or  8 in US men's, because 42.5 in Euro in size 9 in US men's /v BRING YEEZY BACK...

Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc. /v son I can't stop seeing junie when I look at her lol /v Rosenberg face when she said she had double Es  /v I love teyana she's been hustling ever since sweet sixteen and she's super cool in person /v I just need the number to her trainer. .

She makes one appearance, gets the media talking..then boom, that's it.Until the next appearance. Where's the consistency? All you do is give a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, all over the place.You sing, but where is your music?...where is your album?At this point, i feel like you just do stuff to get attention. I see you here, i see you there...but what's you're main focus?When you're scattered all over the place, doing this, doing that, it means you're simply lost and don't know what you wanna do.Multi talented is just silly, do one thing, at a time.

If your skin is like 'this', you will love this. I'm tired of beauty gurus who hate on shit because they don't like something, like their opinion is the ONLY thing that matters. Ugggh!

Or any good blotting paper? /v Change that lip color omg..\nCan you please shift to some darker shades bc they suit you more. /v Youre so gorgeous!! Sweetest ever!! Cant wait for Dominique Cosmetics  so excited /v The YSL foundation is beautiful however if you look at the 3rd ingredient de-natured alcohol. This is a horrible ingredient for skin as it breakdowns your skin and muscle tissue. This is what paint stripper is made of. To be the 3rd ingredient in this foundation is crazy. For anyone who doesn't know how ingredient lables work on make-up: They list them by the amount used to make product i.e. product contains largest amount of #1, 2nd most used ingredient #2, so on. Ingredients #1-#5 make up 80- 90% of product base with remaining being additives such as preservatives, mixers, fragrance, color. /v I can honestly not wait to just spend all my money on your make up line!! /v Can you please tell us what backdrops you use? PLEASE /v So exited for you makeup line!!! you are so beautiful and I loved every your videos!!!! /v queen  slay  all  day !!! IF U PUT ME ON UR SNAP I WILL CRY  /v What's a good matte foundation for dry skin /v I loved this bc you still made it a tutorial! other makeup YouTubers just put it on their face and not say what to do. don't change anything from your videos bc they're perfect & very helpful !!!! Love all your videos  /v when you hear christen listening to russ .. and then you hear her announce her new cosmetic line  she da best  /v Thank you for the message at the end of the video. I am going back to college in a few weeks, after taking a short leave of absence because of my anxiety. When it comes to school, I am so so so hard on myself and my anxiety tends to control me. After working so hard on taking control of my anxiety, I'm finally able to go back to school. I am still nervous, but I'm also excited. /v Can't wait totry outyour make up line. /v Me: I'm going to wear that look on my wedding!\nChristen: This is something I can wear everyday! /v I love how ur so chill and soft spoken. I relax when I watch ur videos n love how u do ur makeup Beautiful. Stay humble and chilled as u rPS don't let no one or anything change u... /v Can you tell us how you did your hair? /v Those brows are what dreams are made of. Blessed girl /v You should have made separate reviews /v You're to beautiful  /v I think she looks prettier without makeup. /v I'm so excited for your new makeup!!! I love this look so much /v I cant wait for Dominique cosmetics, your honesty amazing, Can I be on your snap plzzzzzz  /v Well this is a surprise! I'm not mad though...This is pretty cool! /v Great. Now everybody wants to be HAIM. /v Disappointed... I personally don't like the song but I'm still very glad they are making music again and I look forward to hearing more. /v I AM SO SHOOOK RIGHT NOW /v Just recently I was thinking that Aly and AJ must be vampires since they haven't aged in over a decade, then they drop this video. Alright  /v I love it. The song is great to vibe to. /v The auto tune my god /v They are back?!?! Hope they stick around for awhile. /v *They were my childhood* /v Omg I miss you guys! I loved Chemicals React and Potential Break up Song when I was a kid!  /v Kind of confused by the music video to be honest. /v Extremely well executed and directed. A lot of mediocrity surfacing the music scene and music videos nowadays. Stellar sound and visual combination. Very excited to see what comes next from these two. /v Yes!! My love for Ally and AJ remains true /v Oh shit, the girl from Silicon Valley is in this. /v Odd video but I like it! I wish aj  had more parts in the song and video though...but seriously great song! /v They never aged?? And I did? No fair lol /v Im just glad they didnt came back with the same tecno crap every singer is putting out these days. Great song /v Is the other girl in the video at 2:42 the chick from Silicon Valley? /v Come through Ally & AJ! Giving me 80's vibes. I'm totally here for it /v This was so unexpected and awesome! /v YESSSSSSSSSSS! I LOVE the arrangement and the throw back style! /v Hit likes if anyone remember their movie Cow Belles!! \n\nGood old times /v I love this so much!!! /v This is fantastic. Favorite song/video rn /v So no one is going to mention Tiffany?? /v What year is it? /v Holy crap, this is not the Aly&AJ that I grew up listening to! I'm living for this video!! Love the song!! So happy they're back!!! /v This time, please stay and don't make us wait 10 years for new music. /v make a move and make it now! /v I love how they. Didn't age /v love the 80s look and sound! So creative :) /v This is so 1997!! I love it! /v I love the 90's vibes I'm getting from this video. /v I am totally slain right now. This gave me too much life that it killed me and brought me back to life and then gave me life insurance. Keep. It. Up. Ladies. /v Okay, so I'm going to describe exactly what is happening here. Two friends are doing the whole Let's pretend we're doing a music video! at a sleepover party. Also there were dead bodies there. Not a thing that's usually at a girl's sleepover party but everyone's different. /v Aly & AJ are doing whatever they want, and it's weird because it's different, but wow. They took me out and just like that...my chemicals reacted. I don't know. It's cool. /v yes im so happy they're back, they're so slept on /v i forgot yall were alive /v I love them that much more for doing this :) /v I like this song- /v Where have u guys been? /v Don't get me wrong I like this song but I miss the old rocker vibe /v This brings me back to Disney /v Loving the new mature sound and they're still gorgeous af!!!! I will always be in love with Aly /v I almost passed out when I saw this. They're back ya'll. /v Dear lord I didn't know these people still made music /v Short video of this crazy good song  https://www.instagram.com/p/BYCRXqkh4Kq/?taken-by=reneeariel /v I won't mind getting bit by them /v  who else misses music like this? /v Yes! I love it /v So Phil of the future is returning too? /v I've been waiting for another alum for a decade. I love you both so much! I wish you much happiness as your continue your career!  /v they look the same as they did back when I was like 6 and they were on cow belles /v set my quality to 144p to experience the real effect of the video and song  /v Cool! Subscribe to my page just songs I recorded on my iPhone nothing serious my listen I just posted some I did today  :)) follow me on instagram @pauly.riley. /v The buffy vibes are strong in this one /v Wait, they're still around? Wow, completely forgot about these two. Brings back memories of terrible Disney channel live action movies...but decent enough music tracks. /v The vibe is just so nice /v the queer vibes of this video have me LIVING. Yay more Aly & AJ!!  /v Damn last time I saw them was late 2000's  Potential break up song & Like woah /v potential break up song is shaking /v So happy they're back! This song sounds great too! /v The song and the video wow /v I love the 80's Vampire influence, kinda reminds me of 'The Hunger'.... /v How much did they pay to be on trending /v this has been one of my favourite songs of 2017; i love the 80s synth vibe this song & video has!! so excited for ur guys comeback :) /v Duuuude LOVE the retro look to the video and the whole aesthetic of the vampire/80s horror vibe I'm getting! The song is catchy and I'm just loving it! Couldn't believe my eyes why I saw you two came out with a new song! :0 /v It's just like it was yesterday when *potential breakup song* came out. Loving this *Vibe* Barvo Chicas.  /v The ladies and gays thank you /v Poor Issa is gonna die after watching this  /v Can't believe they're back! I love these 80's influences/tones in the music and the video is so creative and fits stylistically with the song! \n\nOnly criticism, I wish there was more AJ in this! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Aly but I wish her voice was a little more prevalent in the song! /v Can definitely expect to hear this playing in the background of a H&M or Forever 21 /v WHERES MY WIG /v Excelent concept, bad edition. /v So no more iZombie?  /v This is good /v YES. YES YESSSSS /v 2:40 Charlie St Cloud girl?????? /v  /v no:/ /v  /v WTF they still produce tracks? /v Kys /v Dumblonde is better /v Obsessed. /v Volvieron /v Lets do this. /v I LUV THISSSS /v OMG I CANT BELIVE THEYRE BACK!!!! /v Wait what /v Wtf is the SATANIC BULLSHIT!@@@!!!!!@! /v I dig it /v Yasss \nYassss\nI love this /v this is Iconic /v This vibe this music WELCOMEBACKSISTAAAS! /v 2007 called, they said no takebacks. /v Omg the nostalgia  /v Aly and AJ? 2017? Not complaining /v Aly and AJ. Hahahha. Well, at least they tried. Go back to mediocrity. /v Man potential break up was amazing tho /v No white person 'accidentally' says nigger, especially when it's not a part of their everyday vocabulary. He used it as an insult, which is very clear, and it was meant to be offensive. Please stop making excuses for him. /v It's all good Felix. Most of us dont care that much. Steer clear of tumblr for a while though, lots of white 15 year olds are gonna be angry for about 2 weeks. Love you  /v Its just a word damn only matters if you actually mean it /v This has been blown way out of proportion. Its just a word, stop giving power to it. Just because it has history doesn't mean you can't use it. The word kill has been used to kill people in the past. Does that mean no one can say kill? /v S A K A L L A N D I N /v The period I started to swear alot made me say N***** out of nowhere, not even a little bit my intention. I get Felix. He did nothing really wrong. /v BOOHOO MR YOUTUBER SAY A DA N WORD I SO ANGRY I GO JOIN BLACL LIVES MATTER ANF HANG WHITE CHILDREN NOW /v I do not understand why everyone is freaking out. He clearly didn't want to offend anyone. The more people have to think about the words they cannot say the bigger the chance is that the word will sometimes slip out.  People that use social media constantly have to tkink about what are they going to say so they don't offend anyone, but no matter what someone will always get offended. I do not completely understand the meaning of N word, and thats because I live in a country where there wasn't slavery and we only have a few black people here, and the same thing is with Sweeden. That doesn't mean we are racist, I see black people equal to white, and I think they sould be proud to be black. In countrys where black people arent common people tend to say N word not to offend someone but because they hear it on the media and they do not understand the real meaning of it. People nowdays are just looking for another reason to ruin PewDiePie, because he has come a long way, he became huge and I am so proud of him, but a lot of people are just jelaous. Leave him alone. He made a mistake. We are all just flesh and bones. /v I respect you, I always do, I've done for years and I always forgive you. You're amazing, people make mistakes. lskar dig /v It's all good bro. You got NY Respect you admitted you were wrong for what you said. Your good I'm my book /v Can't we all just get along... /v not a big deal whatsoever, don't give me the Slavery? Are you serious? Do you not want to take that seriously? - calm the fuck down. alot of people in this world say n*gg*r because of how common it is during this generation, or even words close to it. not that it should give him an excuse don't get me wrong, but he's apologized for his actions and all  it's pretty bullshit how many people are against him even though 75% of the people are complete hypocrites while having a record of saying it a few times in their life time. along with the other percentage being kids not knowing who the fuck to believe. get over it lmao, it's popped up all over the internet in just a few days because of how popular pewdiepie is, he even apologized for his action(s) - and i do believe that it has more attention because *just like the WallStreet Journal Incident* - they want attention and money to gain out of this situation.\nin conclusion, MILK IT TILL IT'S DRY 'BOIS /v Wow he saids the n-word one time people freak out than he aplogizes.  But when his says offending things about God like in all of his vids no one said anything,typical. \nJust pointing that out. /v reasons why pewdiepie's gaming content ran down :0 /v Mate.\nWtf.\nIt's a word. If people are offended by it then they need to man up. /v Say it all you want, man. Don't take sh*t from snowflakes that are professionally offended by everything. /v my niggah haha :) you can hang wit da k pop homies anytime. oh,samuel l jacksons been trying to ring you  for a role in the sequel to The Hitmans Bodyguard AND Snakes On A Plane haha. My. . . .neighbor :) /v Much respect to you Felix! \nAdmitting your mistakes & apologizing for it is a big deal. \n\np.s\neverythings offensive to everybody :)\n#IStandForPewdiepie /v Why is it all white people freaking out /v He actually acknowledged what he said was wrong unlike other youtubers who make excuses for themselves. \n\nRespect <3 /v Can people stop hating on him at least he do good videos and hate is not going to do anything he said sorry and you should too.Everyone think its easy being pewdiepie what if you were him and get all the hate how do you feel you hate fans may think he's rude at the outside even when actually he is nice in both ways. /v PewDiePie, In america a lot Black people say things so much worse against Whites, Hispanics, Asians and other races.  And when a black person says it I don't see all the hypocritical black people coming out and criticizing them.  What you said was out of you not knowing its an offensive word for blacks, you apologized, now we should move on.  But some black people in America have said words knowing its bad against other races and laugh about it, offer no apology and say something ignorant like if the shoe fits, wear it, than laugh it off saying it was only a joke.  The hypocrisy of black folks in America these days is getting out of control.  Anyways, people should know. /v Pew dont bend over to those lefties! You are one great streamer, one word wont change that, especially THAT word (wont use it here to dont give anyone an excuse to delete that comment) cuz IT IS NOT a bad word I mean all N. are using it... \nTake care brother in games. /v Y'all gotta understand. I bet you that all of you have said a slur that is intensely offensive in your life. Further more there are SO MANY GOD DAMN YOUTUBERS who have said this shit that are white and no one cares. They only Care with Pewds BECAUSE he's insanely popular and had such a following. /v Not that big of a deal. People will find fault and take offense to anything /v What he said on live stream? /v Hey Pewds good job taking responsibility for what you did. I'm not offended at all and I don't think very many should. Good job sister fister /v i'm more offended by the beard /v Ugh pews I forgive u man I been watching u for a long time u one of my favorite YouTubers as a black male that kinda pissed me off because I actually looked up to u just like u said man but u apologize so I'm not tripping about it no more it just kinda surprised me at first but it's whatever your not a bad guy so I ain't tripping /v Everyone has said something racist out loud or to themselves quietly. Even I have but I still have other friends and family of other ethnicity that I love and would be there for them like family.\nCertain words racist words are just like the F word! People just say it without thinking. Whatever. /v He is owning up to what he did and has admitted he was in the wrong why can't people who are being mean and stating that he is still in the wrong see that? Like others have said he at least apologized and has owned up to what he said. Give it a rest and leave him be plus there are worse people out there to hate and everyone's slipped up on a lot of things so quit throwing your hate at him before looking in a mirror. I myself am happy and proud he owned up to it. Good for you PewDiePie :) still a fan of your channel and love your videos! =^w^= \n\nP.S.   anyone who comments being mean to my comment please hold your tongue because I won't even respond to ignorant people who can't get over something someone has apologized and has literally made it public too....that is all bye bye :3 /v White people get so mad for others. Lmfaooo /v If he was a nobody people wouldn't be overreacting to all this.  /v Guys there is a big difference between using a swear word and a racially derogatory term. If you can't see the difference then there is no point trying to explain. /v This proves that he is honest and sorry. I hope that everyone who was affected by the word is fine now and I hope that you can forgive Felix. It was an honest mistake. Stay awesome bro army, brofist! /v Hadn't seen Pewds in a while. What a beautiful beard! /v Why would you make an apology vid? Please don't be a cuck /v Most comments I've ever seen on a YouTube video /v You don't need to apologize. \n\n1.) If we treat this word like it's the most evil scary taboo in the world, all that does is gives that word power to the people who do want to be assholes and use it maliciously. \n\nAlso, I think we can all agree the word has evolved since the 1940's. It's used so much on tv, in movies, in songs etc. It's a completely different slang pop-culture reference than what it originated as.\n\n2.) An apology will get you nowhere. People who may be offended will never be satisfied with an apology. They will not stop until they take you down because you are a big voice they cannot control. Cultural Marxists control everything we see on TV, and it kills them that everyday ordinary people can broadcast their message directly to the masses. They're threatened by you big time. Fuck them! We know better. /v I feel so bad for you, having to deal with almost a quarter of the media attacking you for your slightest       slip up, I don't know how you deal with it, you practically control youtube, you slip up ad revenue goes down, but sometimes you make it go for the better like with the comments moderator. Honestly it would be so hard bearing all that weight on your shoulders and still making videos and smiling while also enjoying yourself l. That's why I look up to you /v At least he didn't do a tmartn /v just sad we're in this pit again /v I would not say sorry for just saying it...if he said damn white guy...would there be this much attention or focus on the subject? I think not...but that's just me...Now if your calling someone that with a act of hate then that is just mean and wrong...yet humans do that kinda thing..I wonder in 1000 years from now if racism and racist slang will still be around or become outdated and nonexistent with the blending of humanity and races /v Everybody said the n word dont act like you never said it in your lifetime lesson learn is that dont say it /v WTF is he a SLW gender fluid who fucking cares what he says, i guess this means he lost to the SLWS /v my channel is better, and ill say what he said if i get 50 subs /v Family friendly Felix is real :( /v Why are black people so good at basketball? Because they can run, shoot, and steal! /v @PewDiePie I know you probably not see it but this is my professor https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/student-professor-dog-hurricane-irma-7.jpg I think he is your lost brother:) /v I was hoping you would not be a weak man Pewds. You know you did nothing wrong, now you're being a coward. /v You have no reason to apology. Why give yourself into the angry unreasonable crowd? See how Cyanide in ZF Clan does it. You don't need to be a perfect person to be a youtuber. /v No surprise..... he has proven already in the past to be a racist and a phobe in so many areas, his followers are just as bad, just read the comments below... ~sigh~ /v I'm so disappointed in you I can't believe this just look at your comments there's some people who are glad you said it and support you more because of it is this really the kind of supporters you want /v I'm an ignorant human but why black people can use the n word and not people of other racial ? /v Congrats. Made it on the trending list /v *saying a word doesn't make you a racist, it wasn't right to say it and Felix is apologizing to everyone for what he said. But how you treat people of the opposite skin color badly or you think you're worth more then them, that makes you a racist. That's all I want to say* /v people in the comments are grouping themselves into racial categories and act like they're talking on behalf of their race or whatever... it pisses me off because we're all fucking human neither one of us is actually different from the other. Stop grouping eachother on skin colour bruh /v It's just a word though! - sure you shouldn't say it to people! But so many Youtubers say it, poor Pewds only gets attacked because he's the biggest youtuber! /v People make mistakes. It's inevitable, but we constantly make these mistakes in our daily lives, and this condition is called being human. However, many commenters are contradicting themselves. If I made a bet with everyone in this comment section and claimed that you all did something in the past that you regret,  I would be rich. But when celebrities and YouTubers accidentally slip a word too vulgar, suddenly, everyone believes that they are fake and deserve the animosity. This is very hypocritical, and unless you stubbornly refuse that you never made a mistake in your whole life, then you are not in the right to call Felix out for this. People recover from their mistakes and learn to avoid doing them again, and Felix is delivering this in the form of an apology. You all need to learn on how to forgive and forget. /v It's not even your fault pewdiepie  /v wHAT'S Up Pewds. Long time fan here, but I support you broh. I understand how shit goes down when you game and get pissed AF. I personally forgive you, just stop being a dummy, dummy. lol. /v He apologized an admitted he was wrong many other YouTubers an streamers have said that word an just made excuses an never owned up to there mistake everyone needs to have respect for that /v Well I accept your apology Mr PewDiePie. It just slipped out. You are still a good YouTuber /v It's not all that serious  /v Tarantino, also a white dude, employed the n-word 38 times in his Jackie Brown screenplay. I think we can let you off this one time pewdy. /v I love Pewdiepie /v <3 /v idubbbztv saying the n word : lmao thats cool!\npewdiepie saying the n word\n: realshit ? /v NIGGER /v pimppi /v  /v NIGGER! /v Huge respect <3 /v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w /v Fucking nigger. jkjk /v I still LAVE YOU /v Stop cucking out Pew. /v I love you Pewds. Brofist /v Subraddict /v Nope, not sincere. /v Shit happens /v nigger nigger nigger nigger /v I forgive you /v Nigger /v pewdiepie is god /v cuck cuck cuck cuck cuck cuck /v  /v *grabs popcorn* /v Amazing how many racists this pewdiepie situation is outing /v  /v Drink bleach and burn in hell, thanks pew. /v  /v iDubbbz says it, its fine\nPewdiepie says it, unacceptable /v Tf did he say?? /v Pewds still cool /v I'm not mad I'm just disappointed  /v Like if agree /v What happened?? What did he say and what was the situation that was going on??? /v Not a problem mr.pewd  /v Pewds says the N word and the end of the world is coming all the sudden. /v why do white liberals hate white people so much? /v Aren't us white people terrible? Good thing we have Hollywood to tell us. /v Yes...always a white person's fault. This racism is horrible. The Caucssion race has done more for this planet than any other race (including my own) and I'm quite frankly tired of seeing Caucasians constantly blamed for another person or group's problems. Hawaii was conquered and brought into the fold because they were weak. That's it. /v Also the royal Hawaiian palace had electricity before the White House did. True story. /v give us your money and go home /v The story of Hawaiian statehood is a very painful thing for many native Hawaiians even now. And the many, many misconceptions people have about Hawaii doesn't end there, either. So much of what I see in media about Hawaii paints a false picture of what it's like here. It's good to see the truth here, even in such a short video.  /v So the Queen couldn't just arrest them? She had no soldiers? wow /v Definitely over simplified, but glad the information is getting out there somehow. My people are a strong people and we live aloha, but the misconceptions and pure arrogance/ignorance can become rather heartbreaking. It's an interesting and terrible story, but reading/researching if you're interesdted is definitely recommended. Queen Liliuokalani did her best and it was unfortunately not as simple as There is nothing I can do! Here! You win!! /v Nobody knows the truth in the states , 98% of Hawaiians were killed off!!! /v Oh I can't thank Adam enough to get this open... /v And Hawaiians were way darker back then than they're now. /v There is actually only one Polynesian nation that remained an independent, the archipelago nation of Tonga. /v the people that are new to this channel, the 30 min TV shows are put into a small segment (like a Free sample) so you can buy the actual episode /v Yeah, you can usually find all kind of shady stuff relating to the history of any given country/land area. Id like to know how good the government was before it became a state cause honestly power changing hands doesn't really upset me unless the previous holder was much better and would have been in the long run. /v Tnis video was over simplified, It was taken over by the US goverment for military strategic purposes. At the time, Americans were anxious about the growing Japanese empire so they wanted Naval ports near it. /v That's more a condensed version. But nevertheless, kudos for bringing this issue up! /v Lmao we actually learned this in history class for school /v Actually he didn't mention that the were native Hawaiians that we're against the queen monarchy and fought with the white people. /v Those poor savages never stood a chance against a private army. /v Oh, here we go. Never even considered any of this... /v And a bunch of them were high ranking freemasons too... No joke. /v Um... I already knew this. /v Bruh I've been to Hawaii several islands and idgaf how it became a state /v Can you do an episode about how communism can actually work? /v I knew that. I could have sworn I learned it from school...did I learn it from a book?!?!  /v Moana is shook\n\nYes I know she's Polinesion but whatever /v Wish you went more in-depth. This was disappointing /v The full story of Hawaii is much much larger than this, Hawaii had been taken many times before the Americans took it over. /v Well, after the overthrow the Provisional Government of, and later the Republic of Hawaii were formed by the Hawaiian Rifles and the Hawaiian League. James Garfield resisted annexation which the Provisional Government was in favor of and sadly, President McKinley finalized the annexation, just in time to secure naval interests in Pearl Harbor for the upcoming Spanish-American War. Congress sent their own investigations into Hawaii, both from the pro- and anti- annexation leagues in Congress. In the end, McKinley was able to annex the islands, and in 1902 the Hawaiian Flag was lowered for the last time as a national flag, being replaced with the U.S. flag over the 'Iolani Palace. The leader of both the Provisional Government and the Republic was James Dole. To this day, we have a successionist movement calling for the restoration of the Kingdom, similar to Texas' successionist movement. It's funny because we have a high school named after McKinley and we have the Dole Plantation as a tourist attraction. /v Anyone else watching this with a Jason Voorhees mask on? /v I'm Native Hawaiian, and I approve of this. /v 1:58\nI like how she said Havaii not Hawaii.\n(native pronunciation) /v This show has a liberal bent. /v Need MORE! This is a story everyone must hear. What a powerful show. /v The British and Japanese were both vying for control of Hawaii, that's the real reason the US took it, even despite many Americans' disapproval. /v THANK YOU ADAM! Opening the eyes of the tourists. /v And that's how it became better /v Wait, with all the quality acting and facts, isn't this a Disney Jr show? /v I'm born and raised Big Island and... Oh man.... this is such a touchy subject. I want to see this. /v I already knew this because my cousin is Hawaiian but it's good to see that this information gets around. /v Everytime I hear the song it kills me... /v So what part was racist? /v Wait you said almost no one knows about this but I've heard about it in two of my social studies classes /v Your forgetting the UK colonized them peacefully. /v There really was a coup though, and the USS Boston was involved. Look deeper. /v This wasn't Anti White at all /v There's way more to it than that.... way more, way worse.... like they those rich planters were some heinous dudes.... look it up. In the 17th, 18th and 19th century rich planters were the destroyer of worlds in the New World. I was an adult before I learned how the US really annexed Hawaii. Flabbergasted.  It should really be taught cause it's interesting as heck. /v All I knew about Hawaii was a happy time and Hawaii five-0 /v Hawaii became a state because we wanted their resources, I learned that in us history & geography /v Thank you for putting this on trending. It's obviously satire and the story is WAY more complicated and detailed but this sheds some light on us. /v Nothing I didn't know before. Next. /v Well...as usual...Adam isn't quite right on the...dare I say it?...MONEY...but he's close enough. Except for horseshoes and hand-grenades. Now stand right there for a minute. /v Who didn't know this? /v Then some bananas happened, and they took Hawaii /v I suppose no one will fact check this either. /v GOD DAMN WHITE PEOPLE! how dare i take over hawaii. /v About time someone told the truth /v Possibly looks like another episode I will skip. I mean it is good to know the truth on stuff and such but knowing the truth about circumcision and other things is more important. I kinda get the feeling that this will be like the Hollywood episode. With the take away being if you enjoy it enjoy it but just know that is a lie and such. /v You forgot to mention that as part of the Queen's deal, all buildings had to be a shade of her favorite color, pink. So all business buildings are a shade of pink, even if they don't look it at first (some look tan but aren't) /v Okay I went to a Hawaiian private school and I had a US history class and a Hawaiian History class. In the US history textbook, a standard textbook used throughout the nation, it only mentioned how Hawai'i was overthrown in ONE SINGLE PARAGRAPH. Of course, I learned a lot more from my Hawaiian classes and was able to find out more of the truth. Thank you for making this video Adam, but I think that the American education system needs to step up because America needs to learn a lot more about Hawai'i especially since it is so adamant about keeping Hawai'i as a part of their country. /v These guy must be a politically correct liberal turd /v So adam will u ever going to talk about how white people were slaves of course not /v The white could of easily killed everyone on the Island, but they didn't. I guess they weren't all that racist. /v I had to do a school project for this /v Americans: It's so awful how China annexed Tibet and then crushed out the native culture! We would never do that!\n\nHawaii: Oh hun. /v THANK YOU NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS /v Yes, let's all hate white people  /v 1:34 Wait a minute. I thought missionaries were supposed to be celibate monks. How did they end up having children? /v That's all great, but you never explained how it became a state. You just explained how it changed rules. You didn't even explain how the US got it as a territory, much less a state. /v Growing up in Hawai'i, I know for a fact some locals are not fond of tourists. Though the cultural appropriation is disturbing, the tourist industry is a big part of our economy. /v Well what did you think would happened? It's pretty obvious that a neighbouring strong country would take over a weaker country that has a lot of resources and strategic locations. /v Why don't you do an Adam Ruins Everything about how the 442nd 100th Battalion came home to the white people not letting them get their land, homes, and business back. Or saying they are not welcome even though they just fought for their country. /v These videos also ruin the time they cover from the show when I watch it on DVR /v In all fairness, if it wasn't for white men giving Kamehameha firearms he wouldn't have united the islands into a single sovereign nation....but no one talks about that for some reason.... /v I actually learned this in high school, no I didn't go to a private high school /v I was expecting a longer video. /v yeah, the the U.S. Navy pretty just much annexed Queen Liliuokalani form her territory. T'was not any kind of agreement, or treaty. Nah, Merica' just took it from her. /v Remember Peal Harbor!....right? /v I got BLUEBALLED from KNOWLEDGE!!! /v Violent coup seems redundant. /v So Adam is  superhero? /v 37 on trending! /v Lol well that sucks /v Apush /v No Splashing everyone! /v This makes me sad /v from waikiki beach shack. Dayuum setting the record Strait :) /v Kamaina /v Free Hawaii /v Fat ass titties /v Meh...America made Hawaii better /v FeelsAdamMan /v http://www.history.com/news/hawaiis-monarchy-overthrown-with-u-s-support-120-years-ago /v Oh no. We took land under Manifest Destiny. /v So let me guess, this is another example from the left of how America sucks, ALL white people are bad, and the world would be better off if white people didn't exist. /v ITS NOT COMPLETE /v I never wouldve guessed that white people would take over land and claim it as theirs. /v Adams ruins everything might as well be renamed Adam Is a Self hating white cuckold. /v My only disappointment with this video is that it claimed most people don't know the truth yet they covered so little detail. I want more info! /v Who needs Adams Ruins Everything when white people do it far better? /v Why not showcase the wing bats on the left, that would be edgy and unique. /v Bro where can i buy an impeach hillary shirt? /v Bill Clinton is a rapist. Seattle mayor is a pedophile /v New level of trolling I admire lol /v I heard a rumor. Not sure if it's true.\nDoesn't matter. Just spew it.\n\n /v what the hell happen to key & peele /v This guy may be the greatest troll in troll history  /v this is modern art /v To initiate proceedings so we can oust Hillary from public office. Yes Sir! - Definition of Trumptardism, these guys are mindless LOL /v This was beautiful. Genius /v You can vote against your own interest that's the American way. /v I love how this is supposed to be against Trump supporters but I fond it awesome.  TRUMP 2020 /v Sure they're too stupid to know she doesn't hold an office, but she still doesn't have a job because of them. /v The whole impeach Hilary thing.. she could be holding some form of other public office and people didn't know because she fell out of the lime light. Devil's advocate I know /v >1k comments on a 600k video\n>Obviously fake\n>Copyright claim anyone who does response videos /v Wow, this guy gets paid by comedy central? I guess him being a joke as whole is a thing?? Serious ill go watch rick & morty fuck this douche /v Oh look, another daily show reject got his own leftist cuck show. How surprising. Cant wait to hear you devote 98% of your show to trump bashing. Like all the other daily show cucks. /v Just realized that we have a lot of dumb citizen.... /v At least I can say these people care about America, I can't often say that about the left. /v The troll is strong with this one. /v I like this guy, he's funny /v Jordan: I already got 8 signatures to impeach Hillary Clinton. Take that!\n\nLady:  . . . \n\nThis is what is wrong with America. /v Oh Christ not here\n\nBoth sides have no idea what they are doing /v This is a shame . Alex Jones is destroying these cowards. Can't even throw a solid punch back at this point . Boycott comedy centralized /v Voting against your own interests, it's the American way\n*nods head* It's the American way /v Well we where trying to stop you from killing yourselves but foolishly you keep trying. Don't come crying when the devil comes to collect what you've given him. /v No! No! No! Come on!!! If you're gonna support or trash something at least be consistent. /v The media is a business, their job is not to tell you the truth, their job is to tell you what you want to hear so that you keep coming back and watching, like an entertainer, it's how they make money.  This guy is just another entertainer. /v So no one is gonna address the Chuck Ponytail? /v Lol /v 666 K views o.o /v Comedy central everyone. /v Reverse psychology huh, you dodgy liberals. /v Impeach Hillary Clinton /v Finally comedy central gives the white man back his own show that actually might be funny. /v Whatever liberals need to keep them sane,  I just hope this and the daily show are enough. /v Check this laxative Prank out on girlfriend she exploded https://youtu.be/UTWTqeNK2eU /v Liberals are still easier to troll. /v Haha funny, they interviewed me. After exposing them, they never put me on.. weird. /v If you think these people are dumb, you have never seen a mark dice video making fun of liberals. Next level stupidity. /v He is a liberal Mark Dice. /v Dude I'm on TV lol, I'm they guy in the red cowboy hat haha, and I'm not even a trump supporter, I'm not even a Republican   my ass made TV haha /v This is sooo stupid...its lame ass comedy central so what would you expect...main stream tryin to be infowars...nice try trash..this will be garbage..weak attempt to be relavent...hollywood is failing....haha /v way to pick out the handful of wackos to make the rest of us look retarded, and before you call me a racists or white supremacist, I don't have a drop of white in me, I don't see color or where you're from, I see policy, I have an eye for bullshit and I will call you out for it, this show just like the rest of them pick and choose the handful of people that fit their racial/retarded narative of the right wing, Hilary Clinton was prone to epilepsy, she had handlers with epi-pens at the ready at every rally, she was seizing at the 9/11 memorial last year, memorial. you seriously wanted someone with lists of health problems in office? I'm not against a woman for being president, but she wasn't the right one, she would have put this country into the ground. /v Ouch ... they didn't get it at all.   I don't know if I should laugh or cry /v It's a dry hate.  /v these guys are just stupid /v This man makes me laugh so hard! So witty  /v ..so his as told that young black man to stay on the plantation with the democrats neither party has the people at heart and for him to tell a young black man these things is racist and horribly bigoted /v Didn't Flynn state that at the RNC convention the very same point, if he committed a 1/10th of what Hilary did he would be in jail. Well is he?\nWould Trumps support locking up Hilary if that also meant locking up Flynn & Don Jr? Or would they pull the Joe pardon Arpaio routine, that he was just doing an illegal job really well. /v Cuck Central....I'm way funnier than this   Clown! He is the Resistance disguised as wannabe comedy! How's those ratings  /v   /v It's not nice to make fun of the mentally disabled, man. Not cool. /v Oh man. Dis gun be gd /v This is Klepping hilarious /v um....why is h\nthis trending??? /v dumb republicans impeach hillary from where? /v Ignoramuses, on many sides. Well, specifically 2 sides. Damn, this country is fucked. /v Trump 2020. I understand that the liberals need a safe space so this video is ok /v The scary thing is there will still be the 10% who watch because they feel like he is fighting the good fight for Savior Trump /v you can vote against your own interests its the american way yea exactly ...... /v I voted Trump. Hillary is irrelevant now that she lost. I'm pretty sure the black kid thought he was signing something to prevent her from taking public office. Fact is, Hillary Clinton is not a good person, but it doesn't matter. She's finished. There's retards on both sides, but the things shown in this preview really aren't that funny or ridiculous at all honestly and I'm pretty objective. /v How stupid can they be /v Now I know of 2 Jordan Kleppers.  What are the odds? /v Wtf did I just watch the line between satire and racism was so non existent here is he an actual asswipe or was he just trying to fit in with the those idiots /v Thank you. Because the daily show is trash now. We need this. /v Either these people are too stupid to know they're getting clowned or they trolled a troll \n(proof the american people are sorta dumb). /v China isnt real? Then you wont get iphone X /v Taking shots at YouTube's like Lauren southern and owen from info wars? /v Usually you would see a bunch of Trumptards bitching about liberals.. but they don't want anything to do with this comment section. Especially a video proving how dumb down and fucking stupid a lot of Trump supporters are. /v How can you put this climate change denying white supremicist on Cartoon network. Trump supportors don't represent the majority of the population. They barely represent 10 - 15% of America. This is propaganda designed to increase support for the White Nationalist. Comedy Central, you should be ashamed spreading this guys right wing propaganda. He never stated any facts about his claims. Just humor & Clinton. & I despise the Clinton's. /v Thai is gonna b fun /v Fuck us all /v lol they are so fucking stupid /v This is some Borat level shit right here. /v This looks really stupid /v Impeach Hilary T-shirts /v Hillary For Prison /v fake tripod. LOL /v The mainstream media is in bed with the Barack Obama administration. Conservatives always have the best crazy shit to say. /v You won't see this cuck interviewing radicals in Berkeley, hmmmm......... /v lol @ hollywood elitists pretending to be the resistance. #fakecomedy /v This man has more tolerance than an alcoholic to light beer. Brave soldier. /v Stand strong kekistan Brothers and Sisters, they will never oppress us! Heil Kekistan. /v Is this supposed to be funny? You can easily troll both sides, cut the footage to push your agenda, but only if you're a liberal will it make YouTube trending. /v Vote against your own interest should be the slogan of the Republican Party lol /v Impeach Hillary! Ha ha ha!  /v Fucking Americans ... Jesus /v *Leftist now imitating far right journalist who verbally destroy leftist idiots in the streets how cute- LOW UNORIGINAL ENERGY GARBAGE* /v LOLOLOL this is CLASSIC /v Impeach  Hillary? LOL THEY WERE ALL ECSTATIC /v Damn Comedy Central, you seem to enjoy having the arm of the hard-left shoulder deep in you, working that voice box /v You can vote against your own interest it's the american life.\nYeah it's the american life!\n\nLMAO /v As a European, I don't understand this kind of humor at all. The extremely well-paid clown goes out and makes fun of hard working Americans, most of whom are poor and uneducated, simply because of their political beliefs? And then he tries to makes it seem like THEY are the ones who are messed up in the head? I mean, not everybody can have daddy pay their way through college and for study abroad trips in Europe like Jordan Klepper had growing up. Some people had to quit high school at 16 and work the family business, scraping by only to have their entire world crumble because their insurance went up 60% from Obamacare. \n\nBut that's okay. Rich little clown boy can just go on making fun of everyday Americans. Enjoy another 4 years of Trump in 2020, morons. Keep mocking the blue collar people and make all your rich socialite friends giggle. The rest of the country will keep on rejecting you. Seriously, what utter rubbish this is. Go make fun of celebrities in Hollywood, or somebody who actually deserves to be mocked, like the Prime Minister of Canada or Trevor Noah. /v 0:41 shit who tf is that /v Klepper is such a doushe /v This is why education is so important. Great video. /v Notice all of the people *not* throwing bottles of urine and *not* beating people with sticks. /v typical left wing garbage tv. In other news cord cutting is increasing exponentially, ESPN is collapsing and soon other networks will follow like comedy central. /v You guys used to be funny. /v She went all Jason on that cowboy /v that's how she won the Hunger games /v uno, as the french say it\n\nDEAD /v Jennifer moaning in this video was just beyond words /v And that's why women don't go to war /v she hates losing ..i think she's really mad she lost /v Anyone out there old enough to remember Ed Ames' notorious throw on the Tonight Show? /v Mother nature is responsible for earthquakes but FATHER nature is responsible for the hurricanes, give credit where credit is due. /v jennifer lawrence is an IDIOT!!!! /v The problem is that she's too hott. She should have only used one arm on the throw. /v The only reason Jennifer lost was her throwing technique. You use a single hand in a flick-of-the-wrist type of motion when throwing a hatchet. /v The original version of this with Johnny Carson was much funnier. /v Who else comes here for the forced fake laughs? /v Obviously she can't throw an axe. She's from District 12, not District 7! Somewhere in the world Johanna Mason is cackling. /v I'm in Louisville, gonna check out that bar /v I really don't think Jimmy hit the hat or the pants... He might have hit pants but the hat I'm sure missed instead he hit the head.... Top one, not bottom.. well depends on the amount of wood there:) /v Big time Carson Rip off. And not nearly as funny. /v Jimmy Fallon was my speaker at universal studios he waved to me and my brother /v she's so intoxicated it's not even funny /v It wrong that Jennifer with an ax remind me of a bad date I had in the past? /v Oh look, the one who blames the weather on Trump. I heard about her /v On behalf of johnny carson, I would like to file a class action lawsuit....sign up below. /v An axe? That tiny thing is a HATCHET, my dude /v I give up on Youtube /v This is a terribly dangerous idea. /v I didn't know Jimmy was jewish until he went 4 his foreskin on the second try. /v 1:10 if that cowboy was modeled after me he'd be in serious trouble /v what the clip doesn't show is the interview minutes earlier. Jennifer Lawrence sporting he Satanism.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Lto_2FI8FQA /v that groin throw was straight out of the Carson days. It had to have been planned. /v History repeats itself...johnny carson had the same bit and the same thing happened lol /v Thank goodness she's taking time out to seek psychiatric assistance for her mental illness. /v To protect themselves from flying axes .... Glasses. Glasses. /v That ending is me when my brothers win anything against me. /v Disliked just because of how stupid Jennifer Lawrence is. /v She keeps making sex noises. It's nice. /v Jimmy a killer and an over killer /v This bit was a modern take on the same segment from Carson. /v She doesn't like to lose....and armed with an axe /v I don't but it feels more like a feminist game to me /v What even is this challenge haha /v Wish they would have said who had done that skit before. A very cool Native American has been a part of that skit. /v At least he didn't let her win and showed his male privilege /v Huh!!! Katniss Everdeen ain't got skills anymore lol /v That fake persononality cringes me /v fun clip, downvoted for suck music. /v Reform value roughly stroke inside obviously. /v Mother nature's... rage. /v White male silohuette?\nMore Joo race baiting. /v Fuck jennifer lawrence /v jimmys thirstyass.. can I get a hug ass.. /v Awe jimmy gave him a woodie /v More like dumbass lawrence /v Uno is Spanish... /v For you youngsters. https://youtu.be/0L5QC9ZJkM8 /v Call up jason mamoa /v Srsly, she survived the hunger games? /v Uno isn't French right? /v Hahah /v A throwback event https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L5QC9ZJkM8 /v tv shows.... how quaint... /v Where is katniss? /v Uneducated white people getting money for nonsense sows... /v what have we learned\n\ndont go near jimmy if he has an axe /v Yoo broo and littoo /v What a couple of leftist morons. /v They should do a bow and arrow contest  get it? She was Katniss. Ill kms now /v You need to come to Jersey and throw axes at Stumpy's Hatchet House in Eatontown, NJ BYOB and tons of fun!! /v Wow jimmy got both of the heads that's impressive /v I love Jennifer's outfit /v He chopped off the heads off of that one XD /v This reminded me of the scene in hunger games with the apple /v 0:59 i was like DONT drop it backwords!! /v What's the roots song that plays after Jennifer throws last axe??? /v I swear they're giving out free cocaine in the dressing rooms, all the guest's seem unstable... /v It was President Trumps fault she sucks at it /v anybody else worried that jimmy is so good at that?.. /v I don't really watch/keep up with any late night shows, but this one is the one I watch if I am surfing regular t.v. that late. Not only is he funny but he is very fun. /v Very funny, said the 1960s /v The exact same thing happened with Johnny Carson and I think he handled it better. https://youtu.be/0L5QC9ZJkM8 /v In the words of Johnny Carson, Welcome to 'Frontier Bris!'. /v Just go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You're going to get the only free secret tool fully FREE for this game. /v I don't care how dumb this is, all I know Jennifer Lawrence. /v Note to self.

Go back to blaming the president for the hurricane, sister. /v What would of been much cooler to see would of been to have that DUMB ASS LIBERAL LUNATIC JIMMY STAND UP THERE WHILE JEN THREW THE AXES!!! /v This brain dead hollywood zombie actually blamed hurricane Irma and Harvey on Donald Trump lol. /v Who would give this mentally Disturbed woman and axe? /v Isn't this the chick that said Trump is the reason for Irma? /v Katshit Everstink in The Blunder Games /v Hurricane Irma wanted Hillary to win, right Jennifer? /v lol jenefier lowernce has no talents besides acting /v I believe the most important part of any meal, is the company we eat it with. /v I haven't eaten in two days because I've been so depressed, but I'm here anyway. /v People eat too much because they choose to. The reasons why they choose to vary. The cause of obesity has nothing to do with food? Really? I'm pretty sure someone who has a healthy social life and is psychologically healthy isn't impervious to becoming obese from constantly overeating. I do agree that modern living is conducive to depression, isolation, stress, and anxiety, and that this in turn leads to people constantly eating as a means of coping. However, those are not the only reasons for overeating. I'm pretty sure that childhood obesity doesn't have much to do with emotional nourishment but more to do with poor parenting and just plain unhealthy eating habits. Take a place like Samoa for instance. The reason for obesity there has almost everything to do with the food they are eating. /v Because the human farm has everything in abundance except for love. /v Oh look, more armchair psychology from the world's most pretentious and least logical YouTuber. /v When I read the title I had the feeling they made the video specifically for me. /v What? Nah, I'm pretty sure I just like food. /v Please, I love school of life but this is a bit ridiculous, Food is so much more than this.. I like food because it's more than traumas, it's culture, beauty, creativity, history and so much more.... also, did I mencione it's delicious??? /v comfort food and stress eating are not the only reason, but very serious shit. /v The very definition of comfort eating. /v I just saw a guy on youtube eat 4 big macs, 4 large fry, and 4 large vanilla milkshakes in 5 minutes....so he probably needs a hug? /v i have not eaten in over 2 weeks and 5 days /v A remnant of our evolutionary traits of eating high fat, high calorie foods when they are presented.... People back in the day stuffed their faces with food whenever there was fatty foods... People do the same now, just that they are at every turn. /v Because I'm high and I'm a fat ass /v I don't fit the narrative as I don't overeat but have an obsessive relationship with food. Dieting is a means of control, punishment, reward etc all these things that affect and are affected by emotion. However, I think turning to food starts with environmental factors. \n\nWe have access to an abundance and while convenient, it's overwhelming. In addition to choice we have nutritional science which is often used to back up trendy diets or clean eating that leads to restriction which reflects the unworthiness we feel. \n\nBut food tastes good, it makes us feel good, it's good, a state we strive to be. We're surrounded by normal people who think we're weird for caring about food so much. So we try to be normal _whatever that is_ reminding ourselves it's okay to eat as much as we want, it's normal yeah? \n\nBut then we hate ourselves and there is no way out of this careful tiptoe relationship with food. Sometimes eating too much is an attempt to make amends with outer normality and inner self-acceptance, both of which are alien at this point. /v I'm having a major epiphany right now /v Not true for me. I eat a lot because it fucking tastes good and nothing else. I'm not really thinking of anything else. /v This is deep but... I eat lots because i'm always hungry /v occasionally, this channel releases complete bullshit, with all agenda and no science. this video, for example /v But I really do just enjoy the taste of junk food. We evolved to be that way. I'm happy and fat. /v Very interesting. No doubt that eating can be a substitute for emotional emptiness. In my case, though, when stressed, anxious, and so on I tend to withdraw from food. I feel too nauseous to eat. So no comfort from eating for me. /v And then when you remember why you have no friends you watch the video the real reason your alone. Which then points you too? Friends don't fix you! you've got to love yourself! But I get the idea behind this and It gets us thinking so kudos. /v This is absolute nonsense.\nDietary quantity has as much to do with a lack of emotional support growing up; as my motives for waking up in the morning so i can feed my libido. This is some next level Freud garbage. /v why was there a postmates ad right before this dammit /v I feel like a glutton after watching this. /v Cliche!\n\nFood tastes good and is nice to eat delicious food. /v I'm sorry but I don't buy this one. I eat a lot if the food is tasty and good. I don't think it's  to be so complicated. /v cause we Americans that's why /v We crave love. And if we don't find it in people we search it in food. /v Because I rather cry about my weight rather then cry about being rejected /v What is your source for the information presented as facts? I just watched a video (https://el2.convertkit-mail.com/c/27uz0wqe2soh83kz6/e5uph7/aHR0cHM6Ly9ycTI2My5pc3JlZmVyLmNvbS9nby9mZjE3cXVpei93ZWxsbmVzc21hbWEv) from a PhD doctor who studies psychology & science, I guess she begs to differ with your solution. I would have to agree with her & not you all evidence is to the contrary never before has there ever been such an epidemic of obesity /v I just had the worst Charlie Horse of fucking life /v Breatarian's don't need to eat. /v I do not agree with this video in the least. Overeating is an addiction hidden by willful ignorance. Saying you over eat because you parents didn't love is an excuse to eat more. Food is a drug. /v I'm fat cause I eat too much.... I eat too much because I'm fat :/ /v Now I'm depressed... /v Why is this so true  /v All this did was make me hungry /v One of your greatest videos, thank you very much. /v Eh... Not their best video. Partially a misinterpretation (or over-interpretation)of psychoanalytic theory. /v Please Alain, this is heartbreaking, I always have troubles with my weight and anxiety... you're the philosopher, but this is an issue for me :'( /v You could eat most of the day if you know how to cook with knowledge of nutrition. Steering clear of sugar and over eating on carbs/fats. knowing what you intake. Heck, some days i bake protein low carb chocolate donuts  or cookies and eat that all day. Not gaining any weight. /v if i stop eating for one minute i will die. /v School of Life should be renamed to School of Projection /v this does explain why when left to my own devices i'll rarely need more than a meal a day...   with a loving girlfriend and hours upon hours to play video games, record, make videos and connnect with a community, i've gone days without eating XD then i had to order a large meal cause i was hungry af afterwads /v i wish i ate too much\ni feel nauseous constantly because of medical issues so i don't eat enough and i am pretty underweight\ni'd much rather be a little overweight than have to deal with the side effects of not getting enough nutrition /v First check your other primal urges, make sure you sleep enough, drink enough, have sex enough...if you still are eating too much than yes you probably have other issues ) /v Or I'm just hungry... /v This just destroyed my life in a good way /v simple, humans today are born with pre existing restaurants and common cooking methods.   basicly, we're SPOILED /v The problem is it becomes a cycle. I'm fat because I'm lonely and I'm lonely because I'm fat. I'm 296 pounds and 5'8. I used to be 140 pounds /v you can't eat happiness , but you can eat an Argentinian Stake wich is almost the same /v Sorry fam, I'm just really craving a slice of pizza /v i've already eaten all of my friends, what do I do now? /v The Reason Why We Eat Too Much is Because of Beelzebub The Devil of Gluttony /v this video got too real real quick /v Why does he keep saying restraws instead of restaurants? /v Because we evolved from Pigs, not Apes.. /v dear god the sound! the SOUND! when will you guys get your levels correct?? /v Holy fuck...what a sick episode /v No mention of the evolutionary drive to consume high calorie foods? /v So it's true what I've always heard; we eat to feed our neglected emotional needs, at least in some cases. \n\nThat sure explains why, with all the terrible food I eat and my poor diet, I never gain a pound. At least I know it's going somewhere. /v Tell this to a teenager male /v because i remain unfulfilled by life so i fill my stomach. /v Wow he literally makes every video about psychological distress caused by one's parents lol /v i rly don't think that's the reason /v This channel always tells me what I need in life but not how to get it. /v This was insightful, I would really appreciate and think it would help others if you could present us with a brief guide of what to do next in this case.\n\nHaving discovered the underlying reason for our hunger, is there some sort of a spiritual diet or program that can cleanse and detoxify our bad behaviours and habits? Destressing us from worrying about our weight/fitness and help us to satisfy our true cravings. /v Man shall not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. /v Do you consider 100 grams per day much? /v How come you didn't centre the shelves at the end? Can't even! /v Well. Turns out I don't want this sandwich... /v I LOVE THIS GUYS VOICE /v I am 8 stones. I don't need this video /v What a great point.. as any pleasures of life, when se are fucked emotionally we abuse them   :( /v Because it tastes good as fuck my dude. /v Every meal doesn't need to be a feast. If you live in the United States, you won't starve to death. Cut back or even eliminate meals. I eat two or three snacks during the day and then have a small vegetarian or chicken dinner. If you can't grow it in your yard don't eat it. If something needs chemicals to stay edible on a shelf don't eat it. /v Apple soup? /v Really beautiful and calming video. /v Because im high af /v Just what my belly ordered. /v You're FAT! /v Daaaamn...got deep. /v anti christ /v Lol what is this shite /v Aguante la Carne Argentina!!! /v Self-control is tough business. /v It tastes amazing.... /v Makes so much sense /v Norepinephrine /v I'm vegan but okay lol /v Because I smoke weed. Just eating Doritos here while my ramen noodles cook. /v Ahhh pseudo-intellectualism.... /v AAAAAAA THIS PAGE JUST WONT STOP SAYING BULLSHIIIIIT /v Bullshit /v Tf? /v Because we are hungry /v *watching this while eating* /v Por que soy de Venezuela, mientras menos coma mas hambre me da :v /v Pass me that drink menu, I heard pussy's on the happy hour special and this nia is thirsty /v 1K Butthurt iPhone lovers /v iEmoji /v iM LAUGHING SO HARD OML /v iphone x undifined /v Introducing, the iPhone XXXTentacion /v This good /v Hahaha /v WHY IS THIS TRENDING?! /v Lmao  /v Question anyone else notice the Poop Emoji in the thumbnail /v What happened to iPhone 9? /v Emoji Move 2: Very Emjoinal Teaser /v *why* /v So no group facetime /v already? /v XD /v 0:39 HAHAHAH /v Congrats for #9 on trending! /v ITS TRENDING /v Hilarious /v iPhone X-terminate all your fucking money /v It's TRENDING AGAIN! /v Awesome /v Still trending /v  /v whats the difference between the iphone 7 amd the 8? Ahhhhh ahhh you see the madafukin ahhhh..... /v Why so soft poop /v best iphone parody yet /v Hey everyone check out my reaction to this video on my channel!!! :) Thanks and jack you are the shit my dude /v I just love these so much... Yaaasssss John never stop! /v It's my bday can you guys sub to me and I will sub back before 24 hours /v I got the new iphone add before this.. /v you forgot the new glas front and back. because that's something we've never seen on an iPhone. /v The big question here is\nWhat happened to the iPhone 9 and iPhone W? /v You're all still gonna buy it anyway you animals /v its funny how Apple forgot to mention that their FaceID technology isn't safe for extended use.\nyou see, basically FaceID works on lighting your face up with infrared and then using a sensor to register the information on distances and such.\nthey forgot to mention that just because you are not blinded by the IR light does not mean that you are not actually blinded by it...\nso with extended use of FaceID (such as with the iPhone X, which you basically have no other option but to rely on it with these new and exciting features -cough- emojis -cough-)\nyou are basically going to slowly lose your eyesight, your vision will become blurry until before you realize it, you will need eyeglasses.\n\n\n\n\n\nso big kudos for apple, for creating a 1000$ emoji machine that will cause you to lose your eyesight :D (i bet they made a deal with glasses manufacturers) /v I would love to have a 1 for free /v HOLY SHI THAT WAS FUNNY! /v They played this on a fucking radio station this morning /v Bwahahahaha Im a huge Apple fanboy and this is legit  /v I had an android ad /v I fucking love this  /v Ummm, I'm NOT paying $1000 for any phone without a headphone jack. Sorry Not Sorry  /v So they skipped the iphone 9? X means 10 in Roman Numerals /v So Apple from iPhone 7, to iPhone 8, to iPhone X. X is the Roman Numeral for 10. Come on, Apple... That's Microsoft's thing! Fucking thieves. /v These normally suck. This one is very funny. If only I had an animated emoji to express how I feel about it. Words are hard. /v This video is YouTube bot heaven /v Well what are they going to get rid of next I would say the phone just the glass /v So I can watch porn on a bigger screen??? /v I'm still calling the iphone 8 the 7S. I don't give a fuck about what anyone else says, it's the 7S, and no one will change my opinion. /v this was on a radio station today bc a guy was saying it was funny and accurate, and i yelled at my father bc i knew who you were /v Is a parody?  Is it really? /v 1k this better fly me to Hawaii when I book a vacation there /v FUCK THIS...\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to get some VR /v i legit watched this at 5 am and i didnt want to wake anybody up so i sealed my mouth /v Awh man I feel so sorry for Steve Jobs, they fucked his company so bad.. He is making 360s in his grave right now fr.. /v this shit cracked me up badly.. good one /v For the face id what if you have a twin that looks like u /v That Chicken sound gets me every time watching this. /v All we asked for was a charger that actually works, but we ended up getting the headphone jack removed /v Friendly reminder that an HTC Vive costs less than this /v this was pure gold. Like the iPhone 8 plus though. its the one I will be able to afford /v please make a fill in blank,and make it, no _ for Walter. /v Those face track emoji things have always been cancer. Its a damn phone and they are marketing the shit like a kids toy. /v I seriously cracked up alone watching this /v This is so true about of iphone x lmao /v Goes from a 7 to an 8 to a ten... Wonder how many beers it took /v Also waiting for the college humour parody lol /v I need it omg best investment /v Jack are you excited for the Sherlock Gnomes movie /v or you could just get snap-chat.....for free /v every spoiled 12 year olds dream... oh I forgot one thing people that are rich think its 1 dollar so they buy 10 of them /v I phone x looks like an android phone. /v I should just switch to android. Because Apple have became nothing but sellouts. /v if steve jobs was real he'd love this /v why does it look so much like the Samsung galaxy s8? I dont feel special anymore. /v its pronounced iPhone 10, the x is a roman number. /v I got an iphone ad before this video lmao /v Now when I watch porn I won't have annoying boxes! Full screen bitch! /v Now that googles new phone trailer has been released this should be called the iPhone Ex /v 1990: By 2017 we'll have found the cure of Cancer and have Flying Cars!\n\n2017: ... Y'ALL can now look like a poop emoji JUST FOR A KIDNEY- I mean a Thousand dollars! /v I'll buy it for 1 :> /v When I saw it I thought it was a joke /v This video was shown on Morning Announcements at my school. /v Team Samsung!!! /v Fucking 30 second non skippable ad /v Spot on /v Please checkout the iPhone X  Parody  PPAP Version on my channel. /v Honest question.\nI miss the headphone jack so I plan on buying a cheap iPhone 5 or 5s or 6s (whatever it is).\nIs there any downside to that? Will the IOS no longer work well? /v This is all just a big marketing scheme for The Emoji Movie: 2 /v Shot by a Samsung /v U still gonna get one anyway /// /v Very innovative Apple,next iPhone will you remove the camera and charger? /v Funny, but spot on, Apple are a fucking joke, dirty hungry scumbags. I'm definitely switching to Samsung, should have done it years ago!!! /v Steve didn't want this /v My dad wants one and mum screamed at him saying:\nI WANT A HOLIDAY, SCREW THE IPHONE X /v Love this video. He is right about iPhone. I never liked it and I will never buy it because I love my Samsung it's way friking better /v Your killing me slowly \n\n\n\n\nI never used emojis ever since the Emoji Movie /v the is their best idea since vine!!!! oh wait... /v Now I can steal memes with 3d emojis now. /v I've tried to be loyal to Apple, but this is the last straw. Note 8, here I come. /v Apple made iPhone 8 & 8 plus obsolete in 10 minutes /v Wow cant wait to get my hands on this! /v I'm gonna have to buy it  1000 and all /v The iPhone ten... don't you DARE say iPhone X... One minute later so the iPhone X... /v Good News  Boys \n\nGirls won't unlock this iphone after they take off their make up lol  /v If it has wireless charging now will they get rid of the charge port in an updated model and make it completely waterproof? /v someone should take a picture of someones face, print it and shape it like a face and try to unlock the phone /v There's not really much about the phone every year they just add a lil more but nothing outta different world I rather get Samsung anytime.. /v IS IT WATER RESISTANT? /v Can you please make video about review of iPhone 8 and 8+ ??? /v Ha ha you apple fan boys suck ha all the I phone x got came from android 1st so u paying 1000 dollars for leftovers these stuff crazy everybody was waiting years to upgrade there phones and apple didn't do anything special so they 10th anniversary was trash I gotta I phone after watching they keynote back to android we'll I don't gotta wait for things cause android comes with it 1st apple isn't 1st at nothing Tim Cook isn't doing a good job well google pixel 2 here I come /v Apple copied windows because they skipped 9 and went from 8 straight to 10 /v Not sure why apple is trying so hard to copy samsung?! Maybe because Samsung's note 8 is just too beautiful. /v People- where's 9?\nEllen- 7 8 9 :B /v The reason they skipped iPhone 9 is because the retards over at Apple think it's a good idea to jump ahead of the Galaxy S series. /v So with adblocker, where will the VPN logo show now? Lmfao!! /v Galaxy S8 & S8+ does all of this, has a better resolution, doesnt have an ugly notch, AND is now way cheaper. \n\nApple sucks. /v How does typing feel now that the bezels are gone? Does it feel like the keyboard is a lot lower? Does it feel a tad unnatural? Thanks :) P.S. Great video and appreciate your input. /v Its funny how here on YouTube, Twitter and 9GAG everyone is hating Apple and in reality I see every 2nd person with an iPhone /v Can you unlock someone's phone with a picture of them? /v Being a avid iPhone user it seems cool and I think I like it, but I'm not sure  /v What happens if u get hit by a bus , how are you gonna unlock your phone again /v Apple just took our understanding of iPhone depreciation to a whole new level, I think the iPhone 8&8+ only held their value for 5 minutes. /v If Steve could see iPhone x he'd turn over in his grave. /v HI!! do you still have the air drop on the X? thank you for your channel. it is really awesome. /v The camera guy at 6.55 expresses my feeling for apple products. /v Definitely not a worthy phone. \nCons : 1)Awkward display design at upper end.. it irritates a lot after looking long at it\n             2)OLED is still inferior in this device when compared to samsung..u can check on the web or a youtube video\n             3) Wireless charging is a basic feature since lumia phones so apple need not hike its price\n             4}Steel frame is a scratch magnet..U can check iphone 3 used phones on the web\n             5)Glass body is gone with iphone 5..so the phone is again vulnerable to damage..U need to save lot of repair money for \n               the future\n            6)No significant new feature compared to present market..battery and performance improvements they mentioned are \n                negligible for an upgrade.\n            7)Facial recognition to unlock is a two step process and it irritates to unlock after few days. Also facial recognition to unlock phone will have high failure rate and time taking though it may be few seconds but time taking with high failure rate.\n            8)Cost of s8 with all the oled, wireless charging, ram, performance is too less when compared to iphone 10\n            9)Lack of home button is not an invention its a big drawback. Home button makes a phone iphone. so atleast they \n                should come up with a virtual home button without facial recognition.\n         10)Unlocking sleeping persons phone without touching them is now made so easy with facial /v MKBHD, just waiting for the next Google Pixel to launch and your review on it.... /v Nobody talking about iPhone 8 means that they only launched iPhone X with 1000$ price tag.\n1000$ seriously!!! Man it's better to invest those money on GTX 1080ti. /v It's a Samsung Galaxy S8 running iOS with a couple Note features. /v A thousand bucks for a phone. Sorry, ain't doing it!! /v lol all that needs to be said /v *He talks very good english for a black person and he has good grammer even.*\n*But I'm not sure if hes being instructed off camera how to use gadgets because he might not know how. It is a fact.* /v I'm kinda glad I got a s8+. I swear iPhones are for kids now. I had one since 3gs. Just made the switch and I probably won't go back. Smh. What happen to productivity? Not everything is about selfies and emojis. Lol /v This new iPhone is incredibly Islamophobic. How are empowered muslim women supposed to unlock this phone?? /v People who get the iPhone 8 are dumb asf /v Haha, who knew that a phone was used for calling and texting that's it  /v Glorifying 5 year old technology and acting like it's new. Hate to be that guy, but getting a modern day Android is an objectively better option. /v Nice phone but its not a revolution that deserves the pricetag.. Apple/Jony Ives are a year behind everyone else /v First they get rid of the head phone jack, now the buttons all together... Samsung is not doing to hot eather with bixbie dedicated button. I think the new phone of the future will be Google /v Removing touch I'd is not practical. Hello car accidents and people walking into traffic while trying to unlock their iPhone. /v so how do we screenshot or hard restart /v Apple's becoming a joke as the time goes by /v It is iPhone x as well as 10 /v Practically magic how they come up touch to wake, an wireless charging so many years later an call it new technology, every iPhone is always late, how they manage to fool the masses is practically the real magic  /v The white iPhone X reminds me of a iPhone 4/4s. Nostalgic af feeling. /v How do you turn it off? /v These crap overpriced Chinese sweatshop devices are for trendy idiots with way too much money. /v that thing on the top of the screen is gonna bother me /v 7 questions I asked myself about iPhone X?\n\n1. Do I need FaceID? No. I do fine with finger scan to unlock without having to look at the phone and swipe.\n\n2. Do I need wireless charging, plus pay extra for the accessory? No. I do fine with USB-C fast charge.\n\n3. Do I prefer  5.8 inches screen in iPhone X without notification icons or my current 5.5 inches with notification icons? I prefer the latter.\n\n4. Do I really want to spend over $1k for a better camera phone? Not really.\n\n5. Do I care about animojis? No.\n\n6. Do I still want a phone with headphones jack? Yes.  I just like the convenience of plug and listen. No worry about charging, and connection.\n\n7. Will I be happy to own iPhone X? Yes. I think Apple products sell to me to some extent the happiness, branding and lifestyle factor. /v My iPhone 6+ works fantastic. I'm rockin this bitch till it breaks or completely goes kaput. /v As a left handed person I sort of hope that you can choose which side of the notch that control center can open with. /v Why is the camera still rocking a 2 to 3 inch bezel when you're taking pics?? They haven't figured out how to remove that...? /v They couldn't just add those features to the 8 or simply come out with the 10th iPhone that represents the 10th anniversary of iPhone . No iPhone 9 . \nI'll stick to my 6s . /v a complete copy of Samsung...and for $1000. GTFOH. I'll just buy a MacBook instead /v I wonder if apple have ever heard of a phone called a Samsung s8? Wireless charging? Edge to edge screen? Loss of a home button? Wake the display by touching it? Unlocking the phone without your fingerprint/code? . Well done, you managed to review this phone without mentioning s8... Or s7... Or S6 in fact. Making the iPhone seem original.  /v Apple has infuriated me with their phones. The 8 is a 7S... But y'all still gonna sell yo organs for it. Smh... /v The x look like a galaxy just change the background lol /v That screen is gorgeous and seems like the color accuracy is better than the s8. /v Bruhhh Samsung has almost no corners and ios Are stealing features from Android... /v How long into 2018 you guys think the X will be on back order ? USA /v Don't you dare call it iPhone X. It's iPhone 10.\nMe: iPhone EX. /v I'm happy with my 6s+ /v Please do not buy this phone. Apple are evil. /v Honestly these phones may make me switch. Gotta watch that vid on the Essential Phone again. /v Wow do not like the iPhone X. Definitely like iPhone 8 but X  /v can iPhone X be unlocked by a photograph.. some pic with a close shot of your face ?? /v Why is the price point so high? It is the price of a car. /v It's too SMALL /v No finger print scanner? Come on... /v I can see people getting robbed carrying around the iPhone x. /v If you hold the power button longer does it give the option to turn the phone off? /v If you hold the unlock button down for Siri then...how do you switch off your iPhone X ? /v Its a Samsung galaxy 6 with an apple on the back /v So where is the back gesture??? /v so the iphone is catching up to samsung? /v Your channel is great . /v My Samsung s7 edge is way better than this..smh /v iphone Xpensive /v Am gonna have 8 /v i predicted bezzeless displays in2014 /v Ho hum booooooring..... /v Atleast it won't explode /v reminds me with blackberry os 10 OS gesture /v It's iPhone X /v nothing good  /v Dear Steve Jobs please comeback....... /v Calls it iPhone x =P /v Junk TBH /v Mimicking the Samsung S8. /v Android, here I come! /v Ugliest phone Apple has ever made /v Very useful details. /v Straight rip off of oneplus phones.

Hope some homeless person finds it! /v So funny who thinks Matt would be good as the girl /v Von \nWhy do you not follow me on Instagram /v i think nobody understood the reference in the final...  How much wood can a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck looked like you its the beggining of a diss track from KSI  called  Earthquake. Just so you know! /v Before 100 commentzz /v 35th on trending /v Ksi reference at end /v They're trending!!!!!! Finally  /v #35 on trending!!! /v 900th comment! /v H /v GOOOOOOOOOO CANADA!!!!!!\nPLASTIC CASH!!! /v That was great. Though sometimes I wonder if you ever read the comments. #mormonthatlovesstudioc /v Didn't Vox do kind of a similar video about the Mona Lisa, and how it only really became famous after it was stolen? Or am I thinking of another channel? /v I would give this format a chance.\nSecond look at things is a guilty pleasure. Revisionist History by M Gladwell taught me that. /v How about The Illiad by Homer? /v It is a great book go to hell vox \nI read it in school and I wasn't even in the  /v You forgot to mention that Harper Lee was the personal secretary of Truman Capote of _Cold Blood_ fame. /v Vox is the real Fake News!! /v you have to do one on elvis he is overrated af /v I was just reading this book /v Never read To Kill a Mockingbird, and Im already a freshman in college. /v I wouldn't care what you think. /v This video really resonates with #MalcolmGladwell 's research in Outliers.  Timing is a critical factor to success.  A great story was able to become well known, because it was published at a time when cheap manufacturing and mass distribution were possible. /v The extent to which it became famous may not be impressive, but does that underrate the book if it's still a masterpiece? /v To kill a mockingbird was misleading.\n\n\n\n\nI bought it wanting to learn how to actually kill a mockingbird bird! /v You have read this book 6 times, you haven't read those other books ever...so...zero times.  That means To Kill a Mockingbird is  infinite % better, not 600% better than those other books. /v 6 (times you read this book) is not 600% greater than 0 (times you read the other 8 books)... it is infinitely greater /v Tf you read it 6 times for wouldn't you basically have it down by the 3-4 time ? /v I can just make a book that talks about how I shoot mocking birds. Should become famous yea? /v Because it is a genuinely good book, there you didn't have to make a full video to say that. /v To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book of all time. One of my most memorable teaching moments was being able to read and discuss this book with my 10th and 11th grade English classes. My students for the most part enjoyed it and learned valuable lessons from it. The film is also in my top 5 of favorite films. /v Im in 7th grade and I've never read the book /v This book is boring as I don't know what... I read it in 9th grade Honors English... I do believe it was the teacher teaching the subject... but I'd fall asleep when we start reading... I wasn't much into it... in fact I'm not into any language class... /v I grabbed my copy when I saw the video! /v More than anything this book taught me how to build a negro snowman. For that, I am beyond grateful. /v Thank you Ms. Kim the best teacher I ever had!!!!!! /v I killed one cause it called me a smelly bum bum head /v I have never heard of or read the book before /v I think you read it to much that's why you think it's overrated /v I read that purple copy a thousand times in school and that book was in every library at school? /v Am I the only college bound student who hasn't read it? /v What if I told you To Kill A Mockingbird was overrated? You'd be wrong. /v Vox:  Im 14 and this is deep.     Really?  A whole new show dedicated to hipster pop culture is overrated  ?   LOL /v Awesome book. Not as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn imo, but let me explain why I compare them;\nObviously Lee's first draft was Go Set a Watchman, but that didn't have the flare, potential, and raw development of pure child innocence. In TKAM, she really expressed how our eyes and minds evolve and though we remain in the same environment with the same people, we are seeing different things, or the same things with an inverted view. In ATGIB, Betty Smith does the same, but it's a longer book and I personally think more sophisticated. I think it's *meant* for an adult to walk in the shoes of the child they are reading about and the one they once were. It's longer, covers a longer time period, and in that sense, covers a greater range of development. Also, I liked Francie better than Scout. Francie was very self aware and paved her own path by being the oldest, opposed to Jem being Scout's senior. I greatly recommend everyone reads both *at least* once but I liked Betty Smith better. /v yet some new paperback books cost like 20+ $????? /v I'm reading this for school. Annotating it ruined the goodness of it\nWe're reading it to learn about justice and whatever because of mock trial /v Do Of Mice and Men next please /v To understand why _____ you need to understand ________ every single Vox video ever /v Ford made quality cars affordable for everyone. Does that mean cars are overrated because most people have one now? Maybe the car was just an awesome invention that Ford made accessable to everyone and Mockingbird was an awesome book that paperbacks made accessable to everyone including students /v He should have practiced his pronuncation of el dorado, but great video! /v I hated this book when I had to read it in high school /v I'm new to teaching middle school/ high school English. To Kill a Mockingbird is actually going out of fashion. It used to be thought as the only book in the literary cannon that dealt with race (that and Huck Finn). Slowly teachers are learning that there are other, better books that students can connect with. /v Do Catcher in the Rye please. I read it in college on my own time, and it was the worst book I have ever read. I don't get why it's a classic. /v To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book /v I suspect it's popular because the government school system pushed it on kids as propaganda to shape their morals . /v can you do the lord of the flies? /v It's not overrated, but it is over assigned as homework. /v I never had to read this in school /v (5:07) Do I sense a hint of an exodus to Facebook? (shudder) /v Pretty sure this book isn't in the Australian curriculum, but it was popular and well known enough that I sought it out to read when in about year 8....I enjoyed it, although I didn't understand a lot of it!! /v To kill a mocking bird and the hatchet were basically the only two books I read in school /v I think you moved six times and read the book in different curriculums. /v My life is a lie /v Its famous because mindless, bureaucratic high-school teachers are told that the book is iconic, so they conform to their script by telling students to adore it. Therefore, your average sheep in society claims that they love To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1984, Le Mis, Mozart, Shakespeare, black-and-white cinema, traditional print and etc. Why do many individuals adamantly defend the quality of all these particular items, as they know little to nothing about these said topics? It is because, once something is old enough, no one can ever question its greatness. If you want to try to come across as intelligent, when youre really not, become a sycophant; then, you can recite all the traditional works of art your teachers spoon-feed you; thus, allowing you to come across as a blind buffoon acting as intelligent. Why bother actually looking into traditional media, having actual exposure while developing an understanding, when one can simply say they respect it by reciting what their told in school? Also, dismiss any modern artists/material, pretending to have respect for the classical titles that you have never devoted the time or energy to see, hear or read -- opt out of seeing Dunkirk or Logan Lucky, chose to see the latest Happy Madison production, laugh at all the jokes while claiming the film was awesome, but claim to have deep respect for Alfred Hitchcock films they have never scene; furthermore, being some cad millennial who reads garbage like Twilight and listening to trash like Beiber. When I was younger we had more less anti-social video games as opposed to the online garbage that these VEGAN, HIPSTER, PC, SJW, TREND STARTING, INTERNET ABUSING, RALLY ATTENDING, TABLET USING, SOCIAL MEDIA LOVING, EMOJI SUBMITTING, SELFIE TAKING, SAFE-SPACE INHABITING, NON FAT-SHAMING, PRO CHOICING, GLUTEN FREE CONSUMING, CONFORMING TO NONCONFORMING, CUCKTARIANS LIKE TO SHOVE DOWN OUR THROATS!!! \n\n\n\nP.S. life sucks and I hate people >:(\n\n\n\nP.P.S  I wish you would just shut the heck and get out of my life, god...\n\n\n\nP.P.P.S I need aspirin. /v It's still a GREAT book /v so its famous because it was good, was released in the early 60s, and was featured in the New York Times? uh...cant those things be said for just about EVERY good book released in the early 60s? yet most of them fell into obscurity. your logic is not logical...its famous because its a great book, lol. /v Never read it. I've heard of it, but NEVER read it. /v I have had to read this book 2 times for school so far and I'm glad someone else feels this way about it. /v I got sum ideas for the series: JFK, El Che, Gandhi, Reagan, the Catholic church, etc /v It's a good book but it also caught the politics of the times. It had a liberal heart, and people who buy literature are overwhelmingly liberal. if it had had the same literary qualities but had a pro-segregationist bias it would never have made it into print. /v I'm not convinced by this. Sure, TKAMB may have been in the right place at the right time to take advantage of mass production, but that says nothing about its merit at a literary work. Not to mention, the video is silent on the matter of the book's actual content and why it is so iconic.\nThe premise that just because one person read this book 6 times and then equating that to it being 600% better than other books is not only anecdotal, but pretty rediculous.\nI'm all for reevaluation, but Vox needs to come up with better reasons as to something being overrated other than, I had to read it a lot and there are so many copies. /v Never read it but it seems like a book made for English class /v To Kill A Mockingbird is AWEFUL /v I should actually be reading this book right now for English .... /v Vox is overated /v Next: Vox is overrated. /v Disney / marvel movies are overrated /v Clear right propaganda /v Vox the sjw channel /v Fake news /v They made Atticus say Calpurina's dialog?  /v can beyonce be next? /v let me explain /v It's a Wonderful Life has an interesting story on how it became  a Christmas classic. Not because it was well received but because it went into the public domain, giving networks a free movie to air. Obviously, there's more to the story,  but that's the basic idea. /v I am sorry I didn't even knew this book existed haha... what is is about? /v I bought it a few weeks ago, I don't think it's overrated at all. Was a great book. /v Wanna talk overrated? The Great Gatsby is pure trash, yet somehow all the schools love it... /v I stopped at overrated and instantly downvoted this. This is one of the best books written in (semi)modern times. To even pretend otherwise is moronic. Between the hillary pandering and moronic titles like this video i have zero respect for anything vox says. /v That's like saying JFK wasn't a good president. It's just that T.V. became a thing. Uh no it's a good book It's Harper lee that sux. /v I ordered a box of fishing weights from Amazon and I received To Kill A Mockingbird paperback instead O.o /v I might the the only person not to read that book in school or ever. /v In high school my classes didnt cover any classics except for To Kill a Mockingbird and Shakespearean plays. I took it upon myself and ended up reading Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the flies, 1984, of Mice and Men, and my least favorite Heart of Darkness in my free time. \n\nPersonally I think most of them were overated and hyped up except Animal Farm and 1984. The meanings in them were nice but most of them just bored me out of my mind. Kids today also dont even read, im pretty sure most students just read summaries on snopes and sparknotes nowadays so :/ its a lost art to anaylyze readings unless you really want too. /v This book made no sense /v What if I told you that to kill a mockingbird is overrated?\nWe beeeeennnnn knewwww bro /v I read it once for fun in 4th grade. - bulllllllshhhhhhiiiiiiiiitttttttt /v I have the read this book for school, and it makes absolutely no sense.. /v The schools I've been in never had us read To Kill a Mockingbird. /v In Belgium (Flanders) the book everybody reads in elementary school is Koning van Katoren. /v And Godfather is overrated as well. /v I do think To Kill a Mockingbird is an important book, but it's not that good in terms of writing /v The way you brought up the Pulitzer Prize, I thought you were gonna say it was a fluke year like the book was actually garbage and is acclaimed for no reason /v This book was so boring to read as a kid coz we were being forced to read it in school curriculum. /v How? I mean white people are so racist and black people are allergic to books, HOW?????? /v Read the whole book, but wasn't all that great. The child called it by David Pezler is s good book and the whole series. /v Please do one on shawshank redemption /v My school never required this book, we read The Diary of a Young Girl (Anne Frank) /v Do Harry Potter next /v PLEASE DO KIM KARDSASHIAN /v Its studied in schools all around the world. I'm from UK and did it in secondary school. I think the themes of injustice, prejudice, loss of childhood innocence makes it good to do in school /v I don't follow the logic: To Kill A Mocking Bird is overrated because it was a paperback? Because it was published at a time when paperbacks were making its way into schools? What's the logical connection? Penguin has been publishing literary classics like the Odyssey since 1946. Why is 1961 so significant a year? TKAMB's status as a great piece of literature has nothing to do with its first being published as a paperback. It's initial sales number may have, but not its status today. /v Way overrated. /v Vox is overrated /v This entire song is an experience and i can not Wait for the video /v I love it , Toni know how to work her vocals. /v Such a good song!!!  /v i really love this song.

My Tamia point they put her last good as fuck album out and just dropped it they gave it no type of support don't do another vocal slay like that, I can't take them doing talent like that not again! /v THE L E G E N D A R Y  \nT O N I BRAXTON!!! \nTOP 3 EVER!

RIP my friend. /v Grant is gone :'( /v as good as it get's /v Rest in Peace /v RIP Grant /v RIP Grant Hart /v RIP Grant. /v RIP Grant Hart :( /v R.I.P Grant /v Godspeed Grant... /v :( /v RIP Grant Hart. March 18, 1961  September 14, 2017 /v R.I.P. Grant :'(\nThanks for everything! /v One hundred to one say Husker Du good. /v This is a great and a sad song...\nHardcore in love. /v This song brings me such sadness and joy at the same time. It was Hsker D's swan song in a way, after the sad and hurtful break up of the genius collaboration that was Grant Hart and Bob Mould. It's funny, because *_Candy Apple Grey_* was arguably their best album - certainly their most commercially accessible. It will go down as one of my favorites of all time. /v The Du!!!\n#HuskerDu /v Good track !! /v Grant Hart wrote many great songs for Husker Du as he did with his solo career afterwards and with Nova Mob but this song is the one I hold closest to my heart. Damn heart wrenching and I'm not sorry somehow!!! /v kless! /v Maybe best Grant song...  Ok. /v Pop punk almost ten years before Green Day and with more integrity. /v I'm 15 again. /v The best song Grant ever wrote. /v I love this song and grant hart /v Yup, maybe their best.  Many great ones to choose... /v i love this band /v Grant Hart and his excessive drumming are indeed awesome,  but Bob Mould and his emotion fueled, sizable, and never unrecognizable voice is nothing to sneeze at. /v A total fucking masterpiece. Listened to it over and over last year after my marriage of 18 years ended. A catharsis. /v the song that got me into them! waaaay back in the day :) /v Before war started(1991)we heard and had a great time in our old Yugoslavia.Remember that land and time of lots emotions..Serbia today is other planet comparing with Yugoslavia.... /v I love you, Grant Hart! /v performing this song :D /v how is posible live not knowning the best music? /v Sorry somehow... =] /v Candy Apple Grey... /v live several shoorts trhought your heart /v <3 /v You want me to beg forgiveness, tender an apology It's not my fault and you're not getting one from me /v 3:37 well if we're gonna start calling out stuttering now where was Seth when Obama was around  /v Everyone on this video sounds really jealous. Lol haters /v That guy will never operate on me....DNR!! /v But it is, a gathering of sheep. /v wait, was that an actual ad? /v Carson has one thing in common with Trump: they're both narcissists. /v COMING TO THE THIS!!! Hahahahahah /v HUD should change their name to Help Us Department. Maybe that'll get their attention. /v ben carson is one of the most fascinating people on the planet. I have never heard of someone who is simultaneously a renowned genius and an egregious idiot. His accomplishments in science far outweigh 90 percent of the population, but if I met him at a bar I'd assume he lost his job as a janitor for putting windex in the soap dispensers. /v MSM: he's black and conservative  so he is a Uncle Tom and incompetent. But we're not racist. We're just saying.... /v Don't nobody care about Ben, he going to get put out soon his acting career over... /v 2017 where we make fun and mock neurosurgeons and praise comedians... are we in the twilight zone? /v SNL is so politically left it isn't even funny /v Seth Meyers can't stand the fact that a black man is more intelligent than him. /v It's like - He he, let the black guy take the fall. /v I don't want Mr Carson operating on my brain. No thank you.  /v For those who believe climate change is man-made guess again:\nhttps://newswars.com/solar-physicist-explains-how-the-sun-controls-climate-not-man\nhttps://newswars.com/scientist-debunks-outsells-al-gores-propaganda /v My dear americans, how did this half asleep guy, get to manage housing?\nDid he bribe donald with free sleeping pills. /v GODDAMNIT trump is DISMANTLING THE UNITED STATES ONE AGENCY AT A TIME.\n\nWHY ISN'T THIS A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY. GET THE WHISTLEBLOWERS. /v Weird /v Ben Carson is one creepy guy. /v What a smart idiot! /v Motherfucking sociopath. Creepiest dude ever /v Ok, I'm sure Dr. Ben Carson isn't qualified, but to say Leadership skills aren't transferable. it's an ignorant statement. /v So who could foresee the Hurricanes .  It seems you forgot we are trying to get out of debt( you know, the one Obama got us in), and in order to do that some programs were cut and some scaled back. While you were busy making fun of Dr. Ben Carson he discovered Huds cooked books.  Oh, I forgot....he wasn't qualified for his job!,!!!! /v The way Carson was describing what he could do sounds exactly what a serial killer say to his victim. /v That Ben Carson Ad like hurt me...im thinking of taking legal action /v Go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You will get the only real free secret tool fully FREE for the game. /v Why isn't the news media covering this issue? It takes our comedians to spotlight the flaws in this administration! /v At minute 4 I was silently saying please don't say anything else creepy,  please don't say anything creepy....and then MAGIC TIIIIIIIIMMMMMMEEEEEEEE! Loosely translated: Ever since I was little I've loved the smell of alcohol while I drill into an old person's head.  :D /v So that's why he titled it The check in. /v cant you say it americans its not climate change more than karma will punish you for yoye sins raiding destroing countries with no reason  droning kids the great yet to com jaaast wait /v Just another reason why I don't watch your show. /v 3:00 that's not exactly what he said, there's to it. He's just a slow talker and your nitpicking. Why the Hell would he say in front of everyone /v He's got a fema tent for you ellen. /v What a joke to the American people! /v Funny how you guys are all about diversity and black rights and black voices and blah blah blah.\nBut the moment a black person shows the slightest hint of not being as left as you guys.\n*THAT COON! RACE TRAITOR! GET HIM!*\nits like you guys view them as slaves that can't think for themselves....... /v Federal government has no business in helping fund a state. Texas can take care of itself. Democrats can't help but get us further into debt. /v Easy to figure out why Trump wants to cut funds for gov housing = Real estate moguls like himself will profit indirectly if the only apartments available are built by them. /v Ok, hurricanes are over...Back to some good ol Democrat hatred! /v Why does YouTube force specific videos to trend? Oh yeah, It fits their agenda. /v So depressing that trump puts people he knows won't actually promote what the department is all about /v can you guys compress the audio and boost it up a bit, very quiet really /v Since when is Ghostface the leader of Wu-Tang Clan and not RZA? /v HUD should be canned. Public housing and section 8 should only be for disabled and elderly. Low income people should still pay for housing, just pay for what you can afford. Couchsurf if you need. But no free money, vouchers, grants to people who are able to get a job. /v Fark Me! Education is definitely not a substitute for intelligence... /v Stop being brain wash you people..... they're telling you when to laugh! /v Carson is so weird; God help Texas, Florida, all of the U.S. /v Since when has ghost face been the head member of the clan? /v Back in 2014 I met Ben Carson in person. After hearing him talk I am convinced on site, that he, is NOT, built for politics. Most of the time he doesn't really know what he's saying or what he's supposed to say. /v Ok I'm no Ben Carson fan but he seriously needs to start making ASMR videos the dude has the *VOICE* /v Go watch 'good good,with god' everyone NOW! /v Ben Carson would make a great doorstop or maybe a bookend. Wait! I got it. He would be a great paperweight. /v im Sending 10mil to harvey & 5 to irma right after we have dinner & 2Mil to kenny , so he can get some weed & 1mil to billy & $1000 to gamestop for some cool games /v Putting a brain surgeon as head of Urban Development is like trying to make Rocket Surgery a legitimate career. /v One fox news clip followed by half a dozen CNN clips, could you really not find anything better /v Their just playing with peoples lives, this is all ridiculous /v Another brain dead troll Ben Carson...Not one person trump has appointed is qualified for any position he has given them. Except the Marine Generals. They are the only professionals in the White House...trump has appointed the rest to destroy the government. A very sick administration. /v Dr. Ben Carson is doing a great job at HUD. He has been reducing  government wasteful spending of our tax dollars, making what $ is spent, more effectively done. He is a well-accomplished man who works tirelessly to help other who are in a terrible way get a leg up. Show him the respect he deserves. /v So many libtards making fun of a black guy. Reminds me every day that the Democrats founded the KKK. /v Liberal Political humor from NBC.. wow what a stretch.  I guess COMCAST will fire you if you say anything nice about President Trump. /v High-key all these casters are starting to get the Trump orange glow around them. /v lol, so many misplaced ppl in this administration. /v Is he just like on drugs all the time? /v I see democunts are still bitching about the fact that Trump is still their president lol /v I challenge  all of you, dare you to access this link and see what the truth is: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Pence+is+a+Pedophile and this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LakXx6A72g   This whistle blower is now dead, another hero destroyed:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl3Q2vKiOzE  The is shyt it real, it could happened to you or I and it is a bi-partisan evil, Evidence pence is a pedophile and possible child murderer and flint knows it and has a list. pence latest: a striver for an academy award,  apparently...  > : (   pure evil /v Meyers needs testosterone or something...conversations with girlfriend should be interesting. /v Is it sad that I Can't even watch the stupidity of many of these news clips when Trump or his people speak. It's too embarrassing. /v I just laughed my Butt off when his Azz got stuck in that elevator /v This guy is not funny. /v Set-up to fail! Blame it on the black dude! Sound familiar?!  /v My fiance and I, entered a contest to win a wedding at Avalon in Alpharetta. Please like our video so we can win a free wedding! You can 'like' our video once a day, and we would love it if you shared our link on your wall, so your friends can vote too. Thank you! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q54gIP6LK4 /v Ben Carson is on sedatives of some sort.Drug addict!! /v Hap! /v Just plain stupid. /v Demon-Rats have controlled minorities for 100 years but when they were defeated by Republican Abe Lincoln in Civil War they Adapted from Physical Enslavement to Mental with help from Fake Comedians like Seth & Fake News like CNN & NBC plus Remember Quote by LBJ : I'll have those N*****s Voting Democrat for the next 200 years. Pure Evil. /v (On CNN Clip) Ben Carson has never run a major organization. \n\nAre you kidding me? One of so many lies said about him that CNN will let slide because they're liberal. Just laughable. /v That clip is my favorite too  /v That rap was so bad the mic dropped him!! /v Must be rough when your boss is threatening to drill into your brain. /v These left wing late night shows are pathetic. Obama president=nothing wrong in the world!!! They lose the election and EVERY FUCKING NIGHT THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP. It is hilarious!!!!!! Keep crying Seth! /v Anyone that thinks that HUD federal tax payer dollars won't end up in trump properties, are either naive or complicit. /v Seth Meyers =  /v My luggage!  /v https://youtu.be/o2aqcM2oczA /v Ooooh nooo myyy lugggaaagggeee /v anyone played nier:automata? /v Glassy eyes may explain his stupor? /v I love Ben Carson /v More obsession.  Oh liberals. /v People watch this trash.\nPretty bad when SNL doesn't even wants you. /v ben is so weird /v Forrest gump /v This video is  hate speech and slander against the world's most outstanding pediatric neurosurgeon by a worthless drunk who has sold out to the groups that want to destroy America. /v Seth Meyers is a racist!   A fucking Racist!   Ben Carson is a Brain Surgeon,  and Cucked Seth Meyers calls him stupid?   Fucking Racist.   Seth Meyers is just angry because when Ben Carson took a X-Ray of Seth Meyers's Brain,  he could not find it! /v Yeah, one of the worlds most respected neurosurgeons must be a real dummy. That's it! Laugh it up people! This should be proof that the media can make anyone look like a drooling half brain. Just because he's a genuine person, who says his mind, instead of a slick willy talk show host, who's playing a part like a puppet on strings. Grow up. I don't mind if you criticize his policies, but when you suggest he's an imbecile, I'm not buying it. /v Hey you know who else didn't have any experience doing anything Barack Obama. Give the man a chance to do his job before you hang him /v A goofy mediocre comedian tries to belittle one of the best brain surgeons of our time. I mean hell, can this guy even tell a joke or be witty without that goofy smile on his face? This is why Bill Murray, L David, etc will always be superior to these late night hosts. Just look at Jimmy Fallon, I swear the dude lacks a chromosome or 2. /v Hateful and racist. Ben Carson is one of the most intelligent people on the planet. Who are you? A comedian? Nope. A propagandist? Yep. /v Ben Carson - highly educated, conservative, world renowned brain surgeon, who grew up in Detroit and was a product of a single parent home and overcame poverty. \n\nSeth Myers - former frat boy turned SNL cast member (and not a good one like Mike Myers or Will Ferrell),  who cracks unfunny jokes (in a smug, condescending and effeminate matter) by a staff of 20 liberal writers on a nightly talk show, that primarily only liberals watch. Has never lived in poverty himself \n\nYeah, I think I''ll stick with Ben on leading US Housing and Urban Development.  If he's smart enough to remove a microscopic tumor and save a life, I think he can help fix houses damaged by storms. /v This looks INCREDIBLE. I've loved Lore since the beginning and to see it brought to life like this is a dream come true. I can't wait! /v Robert the doll? Saw the Travel Channel doc about it, and that face still creeps me out to this day. /v I have been a LORE fan since the start, this just gave me infinite goosebumps!!! /v OMG! Holland Roden!!!! love herrrr /v I will watch Lore for Holland Roden /v The Black Mirror of Amazon :) /v WHO'S HERE FOR HOLLAND??!! /v Is that my boy robert the doll in the thumbnail ? /v This looks like what American Horror Story should be. /v Where is the no sleep podcast show? /v I saw Robert the doll in key west /v Cool!

JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless /v Hah, Cathal 'the GOAT' Pendred! /v I finally understood the Jewish question after watching this. Still have no REAL solutions, though. /v I really enjoy the American Tale and Fievel Goes West. I really like that you did a video on this. /v Possibly unpopular opinion: it has that WEIRD BLUTH ANIMATION that I didn't notice as a child, but it's hard to watch as an adult. (see: Thumbelina. *cringe*) /v Sooo....I'm so for #teamBridget please grace us with her presence more often.  /v Hey, Cracked made an actually good video that wasn't After Hours (which is now awful) or OPCD (which apparently doesn't fact-check basic information) /v Yeah... radio was a pretty fuckin sad movie /v How did she not hit All Dogs go to Heaven?!?! /v Fuck the lot of you Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron /v I am fucking tired of persons (read Cenk) saying that the rightists are moving our culture and society backward.  The Nazis considered themselves progressives tearing down the old order, being opposed by reactionaries along the way, and you know?  They were right.  If America doesn't find a way to deal with our rightist revolutionary problem, we too are going to advance to social arrangements unprecedented in our already sordid history.\n\nA Nazi just called me a filthy Jew in the comment section of a Nazi music video that I stumbled upon, and if _An American Tail_ helps the rest of society to understand just a tiny fraction the Jewish experience, I think I feel that infinitesimal fraction in that I feel a general national anxiety about the future and what it may bring.  It is so important to celebrate our victories.  For all her faults, the way in which Russia has covered them up is a gift to the world.  Victory celebrations can sometimes be the only reassurance that these life circumstances of ours are indeed worth living in.  If we're just waiting around for the Nazis to reassert themselves, how does anyone avoid spiritual nihilism? /v Our new podcast Sequel Rights kicked off talking about American Tail and the 3 SEQUELS.  So many sequels...check it out!! https://sequelrights.fireside.fm/ep-1-an-american-tail /v I watched Fieval Goes West a lot more than the first and saw them out of order I think. the sequel has a dear place in my heart /v Awe. I almost didn't watch this video, writing it off as another snarky and cynical cracked video but I'm glad I ignored my pre-judgedness. Thanks, Bridgette! /v This movie was my shit growing up! I wasn't a huge Disney fan, but the company that made American tail, the rescuers, the great mouse detective, all dogs go to heaven, and many others was like my Disney. /v Which tribe (of Judaism)? /v It didn't even occur to me, when I was a kid watching the movie, that the Mousekowitzes were Jewish.  Hell, I didn't even know what Jews were.  I knew what Hebrews were, because I read the Old Testament in Sunday School (I was precocious), but anything Jewish after about AD 90, I didn't know too much. /v Also, this movie is fidler on the roof after they live Russia. /v when she said her name was Greenberg, I would have assumed she was German or something. cool that she's actually Jewish, but how is it that a lot of news have Germanic last names? (honest question) is it just from all the refugees of world war 2 or what? for example: when most Jewish people speak (i think it was) Yiddish, I can understand most of what they're saying, because I speak German. does anyone have info on this because I'd like to look it up. I've never met any Israeli with a ...berg, ...burg, or ...stein in their names. /v Not going to search ALL the comments but, has anyone brought up the Maus Books? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus\n\nkind of surprised that it was not mentioned in this video. /v Wasn't there a part of this move that was like Karl Marx /v I thought Miley Cyrus was American tail? /v This was my childhood. I watched this every time I went to my grandmother's house /v I literally just rewatched this movie two days ago (the 11th) after not having seen it in at least 10 years /v I also loved how it showed that (through the character of tiger) that sometimes racists are not irredeemable, but mearly a product of there environment. And when faced with logic and reasoning can realize just how wrong they were and change for the better /v Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. /v Hey, I'm Jewish too! What a coincidence. Also, if you wanna be sad, go watch Grave of the Fireflies. Ugh. /v I like her, she's cool /v I've been talking about the pogroms since I was 7 and saw the movie /v The Jews were also blamed for the black death by many European states at the time; how long until the next mass Jewish persecution takes place somewhere on planet Earth? /v Topical since we now have people marching in the streets with tiki torches chanting anti jew slogans and running people over. I'll start the count down till someone punches some pathetic simpering deflection or conspiracy theory into their keyboard at me. 4.... 3... 2.... /v I love Bridgett and I'm glad she's getting segments! /v If you follow the metaphor, when she says its communities banding together to fight to make America a place where we all belong that would mean everyone except those Cassocks, who as cats were driven off American soil. /v Oooooh nice ! Now maybe do All Dogs Go To Heaven and gambling?? lol /v When I watched this I don't remember it being about Jews lol /v Between Maus and American Tail can we say that the mouse is the spirit animal of the east European Jew? /v I seriously need to watch this movie because I think I have only seen parts of it /v We need to talk about it because of furries. /v Okay, this was an amazing movie to watch as a kid. FYI, it's on Netflix right now along with Fivel Goes West(sequel). /v Great video! I love  this film! Crying? No, I'm ok really, I just have something in my eye! /v I thought the kids movie was called An American TALE and the porn parody was called An American Tail. /v Awesome video! Love this video love that movie love all you cracked people! /v Why didn't I know this???? /v As a young, Jewish kid, I loved the Rugrat Chanukah and Passover episodes and An American Tale. /v Called it a Tribe insensitive as fuck. /v Saddest film of all time? That's easy: The Fox and the Hound. /v Always love to see Bridgette. /v I'd like to see more of her in other videos. Just sayin /v I still have both an american tail and fivel goes west on vhs. /v OHHH! AW! this was my favorite movie as a kid & the sequel.  Ugh. /v I don't think it was spelled Tail in the title. /v OK I'm confused is Judaism a race or a religion?    I'm honestly asking /v I love this movie. Absolutely amazing /v I loved this movie as a kid, had no idea it an allegory. I should probably watch it again. /v HOLY SHIT IVE been thinking about this movie and couldn't remember the name!! /v I only watched it as a kid and I had no idea it had anything to do with Jews or history in general. It was kinda weird and confusing. Now I wanna rewatch it and look into the history so I actually get it /v I think we all watched this and can now appreciate your re review nostalgia (unless you were born after the 80s, then you might not know what the heck this is.)\nIf you haven't watched it, don't watch it, no cgi, next you'll be watching the rats of nym... \nI've said too much... /v The saddest mouse movie? The Secret of Nimh would like to have a word with you. /v So the Mousekawitz family met the legal international standard for refugee status. I'm impressed.\nA shame the DREAMers dont. /v What a coincidence. My brother and I just watched this movie on Netflix a week ago. Interesting video! And no, a 21 and 22 year old  did NOT cry at the part where Fievel reunited with his father.... /v I loved this movie as a kid. Actually found this video informative and learned several things I never realized about the film. Makes me want to go back and watch it again. which is shocking for a video from Cracked /v Art Spiegelman's Maus was made before. /v American tail memories are tough for me. One kid said I looked like fievel back in highschool. And it stuck :/ /v Zionists /v I'm a high school social studies teacher and I show this every year. It's excellent for teaching the history of the time, push vs. pull factors in immigration, political corruption, etc. /v Sorry... Saddest movie list with Bridge to Terabithia not getting a mention? Really?!? /v I've never seen this. Should I make myself cry at this movie for the first time at the age of 30? /v Love this movie! /v Very good video!!! /v This video was TOO SHORT, moar plz!!! /v Fival would get deported in Trumps AmeriKKKa. /v Oy vey /v American tail is speciesist, felinophobic. /v More Bridgett, please! /v American Tail Fievel Goes West!!!!! /v The last 15 seconds lol /v Somewhere out there.... /v Fuck trump ! He hates immigrants! /v Happy upcoming Rosh HaShanah everyone! /v She's cute /v dis wahman :B /v Sorry but jews deserved everything /v Don't you know Jews are bad luck? jk /v I loved the movie. This girl is an unfunny SJW hack. Loser. Anyone who says that there is something racist in this comment is a fascist, leftist pedophile. /v You know, i don't really have any problems with jewish people... but when someone goes out of their way to tell me;  i feel like i should be worried. What am i supposed to be worried about, jewish people? /v Make America Alt Right Again!!!! /v This is one of the most Zionistic propaganda videos I've ever seen. /v I will admit, though you asked me not to, that I'm a bit racist against elves. Damned knife eared bastards /v (((This movies' not for you goyim.))) /v A part of me says that I love her in the weird internet guy ways. She seems so cool. /v I dislike this video not because it is a bad video but because it's not necessarily a very good video.\n\nThis does nothing to illustrate why American tail is so great universally,  and instead it feels too much like a take of  i really love this movie and this is why I love this movie for me\n\nI am hearing too much about the Greenbergs and not enough about the mousekewitz. /v Please Cracked dont let her narrate anymore videos i cant stand hearing and seeing her speak /v Nice. A tale of new migrants coming through the front door where the integrate, learn the language, and die if they don't work because there is no welfare system so they can't be a burden on everyone else. Also they have a habit of minding their own business and don't kill in the name of their god. /v I was really looking forward to this video because I love An American Tale. From the very beginning I was disappointed to find that instead of talking about this film you had to turn this video into yet another israli propaganda video. Truly a great disservice to the film is to make it out to be a jewsish film. Why israel is still playing the sympathy card almost a century later is beyond me. Stop making racist content and focus on true film history. /v Let me guess. Its some how racist. /v think about Gal Godot aren't Jewish women supposed to be hot /v So, this person is an israely citizen illegally being in the USA as oppressed slave/imperialist-like-ghaza who should be deported for being an illegal immigrant and a national threat.\nNuff Said.\nThat's true we need to learn history: and the leston is, jews are illegal anywhere outside Israel, and a national threat.\nOR they should learn history, and GIVE UP BEING A NAZI. /v American Tail? Sounds like a porno where European dudes come here and bang American chicks. /v *furiously typing extreme anti-Semitic messages and slurs pointed at a fake cartoon mouse* for you Bridget, just for the end piece /v That very last bit about try not to be anti-semitic in the comments was that supposed to be funny?  Is there a joke there or do you guys really think telling some assholes or trolls not to do something is a definite way of dissuading them? /v YouTube trending seems to be extra Jewy today /v go back to Israel KIKES /v thanks again to Quidd for sponsoring me so i could make a bomb ass music video that i cant WAIT for you guys to see!! download it to get my gabbiemojis and support people who support me <3 http://bit.ly/2imAAPB /v You go, Gabbie! Just one thing though... is it appropriate to be having a tour in states that have been affected by the hurricanes? Some of your fans might not be able to purchase a ticket/attend due to the destruction caused by the hurricanes. /v No don't ever think you expressing your happiness is braggy! It's so cute and I am so happy for you!!! Keep doing what you love  /v GABBIE! I AGREE WITH YOU DONT LET THE TWO INCHES ADDED ON YOUR MID-SECTION GET TO YOU! but for good reason! JUST BECAUSE YOU ADDED TWO INCHES DOESNT MEAN YOURE GETTING FATTER. ITS OKAY TO GAIN INCHES IN CERTAIN PLACES BECAUSE IT MEANS YOUR BODY IS GETTING TONE IN OTHER PLACES. IM PROUD OF YOU BABES  /v Does anyone know if her tour is just a meet and greet/signing or will there be a show/ will she be reading poems from the book? /v Please get your book to Israel /v Gabbie, you're legit the only youtuber I watch in the daily and I'm not even subscribed to you. You're just so amazing. I am in awe of your honesty and your passion for your work. The way you talk about your dreams--writing a bestseller book, making music, singing live etc. makes my heart flutter. And you're also very funny. I wish you more MORE good things in the future. I hope I could meet you.\n\n\nP.S. I feel like I relate with you a lot because I am a fellow depressed/anxious person with a lot of dreams. /v i wanna see a video of what you eat in a day maybe in a week? also where do you buy your clothes! /v What happened to Andrew?? The weird thing is since we don't see him awesome stuff have happened to her. /v Hey Gabbie, btw eating any type of fruit straight after a full meal is not good.

My life long dream has been to meet you, but unfortunately I nor my parents have the money for me to meet you on your book tour (HOUSTON!!). Thank you for all the you have done. I am so grateful for how much you have changed my life!! You are such an inspiration. I love you SO MUCH!! Thanks you for everything you have done. Again, you're such an amazing person!

I get so happy when people know who he is. If anyone doesn't know who he is, he is a comedian who makes a lot of musical comedy, and pun based jokes.

Dumb ass  fools. /v Trash white supremacists are dying by the thousands...sun, drugs, and stupidity taking their asses out...we're take care of the rest.... /v Jemwle was wrong and should be fired. /v Moors are you guys the idiots who think you don't have to live by our countries laws lol is that why so many of you end up in jail? /v All the media does is play white vs black. VA riots were with paid actors. Rednecks with matching tiki torches?  Dont fall for the divide and conquer strategy. /v should be fired the same guy in which he called obama a racist &claim  that the media was covered from him sources I found out earlier ! /v There will always be racism no matter what, & not only by white people!  Why are people more focused on racism than on ALL those same race killings in Chicago,Baltimore,Detroit..etc? Dont see any activist, celebrities,athletes out their marching & speaking against that. /v Trump has done the same thing Jemele did. Tweeting how u feel. So if she gets fired then trump should be too!!   Trumps a BITCH!!  AND A DUMB ASS!!! /v this whole shits dumb.This is America.She has the right to say whatever she wantsr.I dont like the fact that anyone thinks they can tell what someone else can say.Someone wants to say trumps a nazi.ok.Someone wants to say they dont want a black kid in their neighborhood.ok.Say whatever you want.Its up to everyone to figure out who the idiots are.Its the violence over what people say that bugs me.If someone acts on shit then yeah thats a problem. /v Barack Obama & CNN created racism... trump One of his birth certificate not because he's black.. which I'm FOCKING tired of you black blinded liberals who thinks you're in title of a SilverPlatter fuck you get a job, get off on well fair.. appointed fingers at people do you think they have white privileges.. this is 2017 and you black idiot radio talkshow host has no clue whatsoever.. you liberals have been brainwashed by the media and buy the stupid ideology of racism exist all thanks to Reverend Al Sharpton,  without racism his business will go down.. ..racism is a business for the Democrats and for you liberal idiots ..\n\nfor us conservatives we don't believe in racism because there isn't such thing.. we are all equal we are all the same we bleed the same blood we believe in a God we believe in the same music we love. We share great ideas like families and love and peace. There is no such thing as racism , wake the fuck up /v you speaking the truth my nigga. But you geek AF  /v Tell me something funny .your a comedian right.stop reposting false information and mislead the sheeple.you are only making it worse for us to come together and be at peace. You my brother should be ashamed. /v Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't blacks sell blacks to white people? /v Prove trumps a racist..making false accusations without proof is pure evil and ignorant slander.. /v Time to Cancel ESPN..Save money..Hugely washed out..Dude..More minorities voted for Trump Dumbass..Don't use Mexicans Bro...we working...See you at Home Depot... /v White supremacists are about as interested in killing racism as they are about killing the elitist privileges it affords them. /v D. L knows about racism cause he is a racist believe that /v No Jemele your pal Obama was the most unqualified and racist.  And if Obama were not black he would not have elected President or even Senator.  No DL you are the racist /v IF YOU TELL IT, TELL IT ALL! President Trump's Dad was present at the Parade. He was not arrested. He was detained and discharged. Why was he detained? He was detained for not dispersing when told to do so by police. Why was Fred Trump at the parade? It was a Memorial Day Parade; celebrating the memory of fallen members of the armed forces. Why was the KKK there? The KKK was there to protest Police brutality; the same way Black Lives Matter is doing right now. Roman Catholic Police Officers were assaulting native born Protestant Americans and the KKK had had enough of it. \n\n\nYou are going to believe what you want to believe because you are too stupid to read more than just a headline.

Get it in your system and shut the f#$& up!\n\n\nDL Hughley is a Blood. Yet, he on his radio show wearing blue. What the f#@* kind of stupid a$$ $h!t is that? He said 85 year old white men and racism generally go hand in hand. Well some in America would say young black men and gang bangin generally go hand in hand. Just cause you think it so don't make it so. Just cause you believe it's true don't make it true.\n\n\nLet me ask you this: If I'm friends with a Billionaire, what does that make me? A BILLIONAIRE'S FRIEND STUPID. THINK ABOUT IT. I get the benefit of the lifestyle without any of the headaches. /v Are u high DL ? \nShut the fuc up \nU ass \nAnother mindless celebrity \nGo douche ur self /v White conservatives generally defend their own no matter so what DL says is right. These people could call a black person a nigger and say they are not racist. /v Donald Trump is NOT  a white supremacist. EOD . The same people that call Trump racist follow and adhere to Louis Farrakhan . Who is also a bigot and anti Semite himself . Hypocrisy at its finest /v To see Sarah fuckabee Sanders feign outrage and call for the firing of someone who she KNOWS is telling the truth pretty much confirms it for me that she along with her equally idiotic daddy are pretty much the kind that harbor racist tendencies themselves. Idk why that trick hasn't quit the job herself. Spicer was a clown too but at least he had the common decency to realize that he couldn't keep lying for that racist ass bozo of a president we have. Jemele spoke the truth and if folks can't take it or don't like her than CHANGE THE GODDAMN CHANNEL! /v See what ???? This week I seen a girl put in the freezer then the real gee money shot in the head I guess blac on black comes hand to hand dl works for the left sale out if I go to work and tweet about obama I would get fired..espn numbers are down so they need Hail Marys . Once we can prove trump being a racist then we can go from there.. can't even prove anything about Russia the deeper they look at Russia u see the democrats involved with them.. where's obamas my brothers keeper money go???biggest killer to blacks is the democrats planned parenthood look up the state DL tell the blacks the truth /v Donald Trump doesn't stick to politics. I didn't hear ESPN complaining when Trump was speaking about Colin Kaep and why he wasn't hire and how the owners didn't want to get a nasty tweet from him. /v Yeah I SAID IT! /v Lol he said Joe Arpaio ran a Mexican concentration camp. This is beyond fake news. Lol He said equivilate. What an idiot /v I'm not racist or prejudice I have white friends  all jokes aside he is (Trump) who we thought he was and we letting him of the hook . Dems keep ya eyes on the prize /v The problem is people who are racist are calling a lot of other people racist. Both sides claim the moral high ground and both sides are rolling in the gutter. /v Jemel Hill is right everything she said about Trump is true And shame on E S P N for trying to cover this ugly mess up. /v I'm just trying to understand what the rules are. The people have gotten fired for supporting Trump on certain networks. But this woman doesn't have to apologize nor does she get fired.....??????? /v This is like the pot calling the kettle nigga isn't? /v This dude so ass...what has DL done for the black community....not shit...dude aint even funny /v Didn't this idiot Miss Hill say that Trump wouldn't have been elected if he wasn't white? That is the exact definition of racism. DL, you've got to be the worst race baiting retard on the internet. You don't even see how you're handicapping your own people. Mentally enslaving them for the sins of all of our forefathers. Are we all humans or you going to continue separating us based on the color of our skin. Every culture has been oppressed or enslaved by their own kind and by others. Quit your crying and look for solutions moron. Instead of singing this poor me song we've all heard way, way too many times. Power to the people with strong minds. Fuck your group think culture. /v Damn,  trump got decades of racism under his belt. Time for the dickriders  to call it what it is /v I wonder if ESPN would've suspend her if she's not Black/African American. It looks like ESPN played it really safe by not saying or doing anything about it. /v Chill it's her opinion, it's obvious he is a white supremacist doesn't condemn Charlottesville but condemns other rallies like black lives matter or the wall he is saying he would put up /v Trump IS a white supremacist and I love him for it. WHITE POWER HEIL HITLER Fuck all minorities get the fuck out of America /v We should get rid of the confederate flag and symbols, but keep the word nigga in our songs and poetry and in the movies, nobody will ever associate a black person with something bad again. /v every tv or radio  or comedy  special that  comes on tv that may have contreversal remarks put disclaimers before shows /v Who the fuck is Jemele and why should we a give a shit about her opinion. Shes a misinformed shit head. /v Lol. Trump won because i voted for him. Stfu with white supremacy. /v She spoke the truth, but unfortunately commenting on it isn't going to do much. We've seen the true America and a lot of people wanted to believe it isn't that way. /v The issue is. Where is her evidence. /v I hear Jemele man be steppin out wit a white woman. Dats why dat bitch so mad at white people. smdh /v In my opinion, Jemele Hill is the ignorant one. /v White people and people that benefit from white supremacy are the ONLY racist. Blacks are the the most natural human superior beings and that's why they hate us, you don't think they secretly and sometimes openly hate that we are so gifted and talented at natural humanly things? These white devils are inhumane and u should get why they care about dogs more than a real human being. All whites are racist to 50% or to 110% they are just at different levels. And the whites that really believe they are not racist and wanna comment show u how bad they are racist by spinning it back on the most oppressed people in this entire world; in history; God's true people. /v If you use white people as a blanket term.....guess what? That's racist lol /v Shut the hell up hugely ass, you and all your raciest speaking as if it's a proven fact that Trump is a raciest is flat out BS and you spouting misinformation is a biased ass speaking out of his ass. So then you must be an ass, I said it therefore you are. It's so easy to call people names and spout what you think they are but without knowing the person personally you have no right with you  either. /v (Build your house with Jesus on the rock and you will never sink, that's IF we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\n\n(Jesus):\n\nAbide in me,\nand I in you.\nAs the branch\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\nexcept it abide in the vine;\nno more can ye,\nexcept ye abide in me.\n\n(John 15:4).\n\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper.

She considers all white people racist. Long history here, folks. Disgusting and racist comments from her back in '08 to. No room for this in our sports entertainment. You're fired. Jemele FAKE NEWS Hill. /v What is wrong with upholding the law and want people who want to come in this country go through immigration like every one else  and people working like everyone else.   Mr dl hughley is an idiot and so is this espn woman /v LOL what a piece of shit bitch, all I see is liberal tears here lmfao /v Black's are the most violent and criminal race in America.

You are a racist, so is Hillary... That is all you want to talk about.  I deal with all types and colors and religions and I treat everyone like I want to be treated.... And I assure I do not want to be treated as a racist.  That term has lost it's meaning because many people spew it at everything.  So if you call everyone a racist, it is moot as a term.  Maybe you need to get some more descriptive adjectives?  Or rethink your basis for making judgments... /v I hope she doesn't apologize  because everything she said was the truth. If dunce Trump can dish it then he should be able to take it.  DL you forgot to mention The Central Park Five, when dunce Trump wanted  the death penalty reinstated  for five innocent minority men for raping a white women. Also, he referred to those young men as animals, beasts, thugs, and niggers. /v Porch monkeys just mad there EBT cards don't work...coons need  to realize when name calling expect to be called a nigger back /v To be ready for God's arrival.

Did a 60 second video discussing the Jemele Hill situation using an entertaining courtroom setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFXZUbKEJ7I /v As a black person I feel black folks need to focus on supporting our community, and families. Blacks complaining about police and politicians is a small issues compared to the things we can change. Black America has a high rate of fatherless and out of wedlock homes. We can change that. Our kids need better schools, teachers, and our kids need to turn the tv off and compete better for grades and not just sports.  Our rich black athletes need to create black businesses and jobs in the black communities.  Our black men need to stop selling drugs and committing crimes which is destroying our black communities. DL HUGHLESS AND BLACKS IN THE MEDIA IS TOO AFRAID TO SAY THESE THINGS because this a message that is not popular with the black community but this stuff is what will elevate us to a higher level. /v Done with you. /v trump suports white supremicist..thats a fact /v Tell the truth  /v FIRE HER /v Jemele Hill for President /v .limmy t /v Jemele hill is an ugly cunt. /v I ate a meatball today /v All you dindus are incompetent . /v Your species are\nAfricoon \nAfro-Anthropoid \nAfroid \nAfropoid\nAmericoon \nBaboon \nBangkok Nigger\nBlack (as in 'payback black!') \nBlack Ass \nBlack Hole (Ho) \nBlack Tiger Bait \nBlackamoor \nBlackie \nBlacky \nBlood (or Crip) \nBlubber Lips\nBlue Gum \nBlue lip -s (as in 'blue lipped little chimp') \nBone nose \nBongoid \nBootlips (Bootlipped turd) \nBoy \nBrillohead \nBro-Hammer (As in Cadillac Brougham) \nBrowny \nBubba (or Bubba Brown) \nBuck (male) \nBurrhead \nButtnugget \nChimp \nCongoid \nCoon \nCotton picker \nCrackhead \nCrumb-snatcher (nigglet) \nCrip (or Blood) \nDAFN \nDark Waste of Space \nDarkie (or Darky) \nDefendant \nDoo-Doo Brown (Mr.) \nEggplant \nEthiop \nFecal critter \nFuckwit \nGolly wog \nGorilla \nGroid \nGutter monkey \nHigh Yella (light-skinned negro) \nHo (female) \nHomo-simian\nHood Rat \nInmate \nJig \nJigga \nJiggaboo (or Jigaboo) \nJigroid \nJungle bunny\nKaffir \nKnuckle dragger \nKoko \nLooter\nLiver lip \nLiverlips \nLOOTer \nMajete/pinche majete (Sp.) \nMau-Mau \nMelanzana (la) (=Eggplant) (It.) \nMestizo (bastard) \nMidnight at noon \nMississippi wind chime\nMonkey \nMoolie -s (Am. & It.) \nMoon cricket \nMoose lips \nMorgue Dog \nMoving target \nMud People \nMud Puppy \nMud Shark \nNegro \nNegroid \nNig \nNigger \nNiggerRican \nNigglet (rug rat)\nniggROIDS\nNignog \nNog \nO.J. \nObsolete Farming Equipment \nOctoroon (One-eighth nigger)\nPickaninny \nPiece of shit \nPorch Monkey \nPotato nose \nQuadroon (One-quarter nigger)\nR.N.

White people hella salty she spitting facts /v so true /v Barack Obama sat in the congregation of Jeremiah Wright and had many conversations with Louis Farrakhan. That would make him a black supremecist and a racist by your dumbass standards. He also did the eulogy for Robert Byrd, an ex leader of the KKk and he also sang the praises of Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals. Name one white supremecist that Trump has sat in the congregation of and supported. DL is a mouthpiece for his Democratic masters and so is Jemelle. Y'all ain't doin shit but trying to make things worse. Y'all (liberals) wake up everyday with a how can I be offended today mentality. Everybody that doesn't agree with you is a racist and all people that aren't white that don't agree with you are sellouts or coons. Black folks in Chicago are dying in the streets and you stay silent...No marches...no organized protests...NOTHING. That let's me know you're in the rich white folks liberal Hollywood back pockets. All these washed up c-list actors/comedians ridin on Trump's coattails trying to get back in the limelight of liberal hollyweird. DownLow Hughley...bend over for your Democratic masters. How you support a party that enslaved your own people.... YOU'RE THE F'N SELLOUT! /v Blacks are the true racists in America /v man they got some racist blacks on these you tube posts. why dont you prove he is a white supremacist /v WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!? /v So if it gets brighter with every filter you add... why dont we add a thousand filters so its shining as bright as a lamp? We wouldnt even need electricity and yeah. Oh my god i came to another idea. We could use this to shine bright light on solar panels. But watch out. I did the maths and im pretty sure if we add too many filters we might create a second sun /v This works with polarizing filters don't just eliminate light not polarized at a specific angle. The light that does go through is normalized to a specific polarity, so light is changed as it goes through the first filter, so that's why you see this result. It's not a pardox. There's a better explanation here: http://www.alienryderflex.com/polarizer/ /v What if what we think to be dark is actually just  a wavelength of light that we cannot see? Or that certain wavelengths of certain polarity gets blocked by filter A and B which turns it into infrared, or ultraviolet, or radar or x-rays or maybe even gamma rays.\nThat certainly explains where the missing particles go...\n*And That We Just Can't See Them*\nMaybe we looking at this the wrong way?\nI'm not to sure about this theory, because my science level of understanding is high-school level. /v You start with a nice experiment everybody can do at home, and all of a sudden talk about entangled electrons. It's no surprise ordinary people do not understand what voodoo you are talking about. /v What if they just shift their polarization to fit the gap though some geometry in the electromagnetic field created by the filter? That way it would be easier to pass though a second one because half of the shift occurred on the filter before /v I agree with some comments here. What if the filter interferes with the photons giving them a slight spin/rotation, not big enought to make them rotate a full 90 degrees thus no light passing when filters are perpendicular but enought that when enough filters are stacked, they actually allow more light to go through due to the spin by the filters. I think the error in this experiment is the filter and not the light itself. /v Why with 22.5 the 85% of the light goes through instead of the 75%? Because its not linear, it matches the SIN function. /v All of the light emerging from a linear polarizer is polarized in the direction of the axis of the polarizer, regardless of the polarization angle of the light entering the polarizer.  The polarizer does not act purely as a filter that blocks or passes the photons.  This fully explains what happens when the third polarizer is added. /v What happens if beam splitters or prisms are used with these polarizers? /v They said it themselves, polarizers are quantum measuring devices, measuring something's quantum state changes it. Of course, that explains nothing as this is just the most readily available example of a much bigger question, but I find it comforting none the less.\n\nIt doesn't surprise me though that this isn't more widely known about, I bet if you were to randomly survey people they'ed usually tell you that polarization blocks UV rays. \n\nHuh, the polarizers are in a way asking the photons a leading question. /v I read a simple book about how LCD cells work, and that explained the polaroid stuff by saying that any light that does pass through a filter between 0 and 90 will be polarized in the direction of that filter. You have light coming from A and going to 45 tilted B. 50% of it passes through and that is now polarized in B's direction, meaning some of it can now turn again to pass through C. The polarization makes like a twist when it passes through many filters at different angles. Only if two filters immeziately after ech other are 90 tilted does light get blocked completely.\n\nYes? No? Maybe? /v Polarized light microscopy, which employs crossed linear polarizers, is widely used to characterize the morphology of materials (e.g polymers, minerals).  For example - an unoriented or amorphous polymer appears completely dark when imaged through crossed polars. In contrast, an oriented or semicrystalline polymer displays interference colors through cross polars as it alters the polarization of light that passes through (see birefringence). The same is happening when you insert a polarizer (also an oriented polymer) between the two crossed polars - the light exiting the middle polarizer is now elliptically polarized, which can pass through the third/final polarizer resulting in a bright image /v Such channels deserve more publicity yet I see Jake Paul videos on the trending page. Oh the irony. /v The shitty music is really annoying, it filters 15% of viewers,  trying to follow another 15% drops out, but at the same time the music gives you the impression that at any point they are going to serve you a kickstarter gimmick and it drops it down to 15%... yet at the end it's 85%. What gives?? /v I'm not too good with this whole quantum physics thing but going by the logic in the video, it would be possible to create a polariser that only has a negligible effect on brightness by having a large amount of polarising filters angled at small angles away from each other right? /v But I like pop science too, it leads me into the mainstream science /v But isn't light a wave as well as a particle? Does that play a role? /v Pardon my lack of knowledge.  But what stops us from explaining it as thus:  When a photon passes through a polarizing filter it becomes a dormant photon.  It appears to be blocked, but it continues on it's way and can be activated by passing through any filters again.  This would solve all of the problems if I am not mistaken. /v This is becasue you are thinking one way about cause and effect. Reverse your assumptions. instead of assuming it is the filter that effects changes in the light waves assume it is the light waves effect changes in the filter. Part of the light causes no effect and part causes an effect. You see light so the natural tendency is to follow the order you used, because of your ability to observe via sight. The energy in the light waves has to go someplace and you are not accounting for the blocked photons change of state. e.g. light to heat; being reflected; etc. which could easily account for your differences in numbers without entanglement. For example blocked is relative only to the photons that pass through as opposed to those that don't. Assume a partial reflection instead, and you have light passing through A that bounces back and forth between A and B and light passing through B that bounces back and forth between B and C. You are being confused by the simplicity of both your method and the set up, but your numbers do not allow for all possibilities created by that set up. Energy and matter don't just disappear but do change states.\nThe problem is not in the theories but in the fact that humans make assumptions according to what they have been taught and how they assume the cause and effect relationship according to their preconceived suppositions. /v Please do a podcast together. /v Why are we assuming that it should be 50%? It should be whatever the result is. On top of that, we KNOW that all of the photons that pass through the filter are altered in their polarization to the alignment of the filter. So why in the world would we assume that anything different would happen? Also, why are we trying to do the math as if the photons' polarization ISN'T modified by the filters when we know that it is?\n\nI'm so confused by all of the terrible assumptions being made.\n\nThe only thing this appears to absolutely prove is non-locality, which is a perfectly reasonable conclusion given we already know that space-time can be heavily manipulated by concentrations of energy, if not more than that. /v I think that you are thinking about this problem in too much of a mathematical sense. In a polarizer, the photon only goes through if it has a different orientation than the film. By this definition, it is statistically impossible for any photon not to pass through the film (by principle that it is the same type of infinity that says that two things cannot happen at the exact same time given enough significant figures). This means that the polarizer has a tolerance for angular displacement of photons entering, and that the act of passing through the polarizer has an effect on the orientation of the photon that also includes uncertainty /v The photons pass through all 3 filters. The energy is just emitted as light when it hits the filter at the same angle as the wiggle of the photon, which explains why the addition of the 3rd filter is brighter /v am i the only one who feels like this makes perfect sense? i mean i couldnt tell you the math part but i really dont see the paradox /v What about heat? If the photons get absorbed or reflected off the filter, the filter should heat up, yes? If it doesn't, that means all the photons passed through anyway, and spontaneously changed their polarization after passing through it. /v It's all sorcery. Or Gremlins. Yeah, probably gremlins. /v Imagine it like railroad tracks. One set goes north south, the other east west. By introducing another set of tracks at an angle in between, it gets easier for the train to go from one set to the other. The more tracks at different angles, the more curved the overall track, and the easier it gets. /v My brain was a mush by the time I reached 2 minutes in the video... How the fuck did I land up here, I was watching iphone X videos.. /v Wait doesn't it make sense that the polorized filter is changing the properties of the photons? So what if the photons are acting like  a flat board shooting through space and the polorized filter is like a slot for the photon boards to fit through. Now if you put down one filter it forces all photons to go through to be oriented vertically, and if you put another one after it that's rotated 90, then no light would get through because the slots would be set horizontally. Now if you put a filter between them at 45 isn't it possible that the photon boards would be deflected from their original vertical course and be skewed slightly sideways? And then be skewed slightly sideways again once hitting the last filter? So instead of having to jump from vertical to horizontal it can go in degrees in between making it easier for the photons to jump. /v I totally understood all of this... :S /v I have a Physics degree and still struggled with this video... (We did cover this in the course but I can't remember) /v It seems to me that the polarization of the light is being affected when passing through the second filter. Some of the light is rotated or shifted if you will, thus making it more likely to pass through the final filter, which would normally be like a wall because the polarization was not affected. So why couldn't you argue some mechanism for the filter affecting the state of the hidden variables once they pass through the second filter, therefore altering the probabilities to what you see? /v Is there any chance that the entanglement is simply broken during the filter experiment? /v It's obviously that the universe is just drunk. /v You lost me at 'if'. /v Two of my favourite channels collaborating together producing minutes of awesomeness. Loving this:D /v The only theory that i can think of is that the amount of photons blocked by a lens depend on the difference in angle with the PREVIOUS lens.\n\nIf the 2 lenses have a difference degree of 90 then all light is blocked\n\nIf the 2 lenses have a difference degree of 45 then a part of the light is blocked\n\nif the 3 lenses all have a difference of 45 degrees a part of the light between A and B gets blocked, then another part between B and C gets blocked.\n\nThis however does not shows why if you have lens A at 0 degrees, lens B at 90 degrees, and lens C at 45 degrees, light can still get through. /v what if the wave particle hase a virtual string like thing in its path and the sum in mesuring pint were the particle shuld end up is total the theoretical ways ewen the first or second thing suld be all moust shurtenly blocking it ? /v The lie of the wave. /v I wish I was intelligent but I'm not. /v What if polarisation is like trig and when light passes trought it the angle of the wave changes making it more likely to pass trough another filter working as almost an angular gradient. The more filters the smoother the gradient making it bighter /v This is so cool. I'm a physics major, and we literally talked about this exact topic, photon polarization and Bell's theorem, in the first lecture of my Quantum theory II course. Also don't think I didn't recognize that Dirac notation. I knew basically all of this stuff, or at least most of the theory behind it, already, but it's so great to see advanced college level physics be talked about on one of these big science channels that isn't PBS Space Time. They already do that. But none the less. Awesome video guys! /v Why is it that we believe a photon only has the options of  passing or being blocked by a polarized filter?  What tests have been performed to rule out the polarized filter affecting the polarization of the light?  High speed objects don't quick changes, or right angles. What if it is like a bullet down the barrel of a gun?  At 90 degrees the bullet fails to pass, at 45 much better, and 22.5 better yet.  Using a series of angles we can create a curve to bend the trajectory of a bullet.  Why is it that a series of polarized filters can't be acting as a curve to bend the polarization of light that passes through it? /v So we are all going to use the word theory erroneously now?\n\nThere is a reason this is called Bell's theorem. \n\nThe word you lot need to use is hypothesis. /v Is the light bouncing off the filters and reacting with itself taken into consideration here? /v *sigh* I mean light gets polarized as it strikes a surface right? Because of it reorienting on a surface, or glare, polarized filters are good at blocking it out. Could photons waving around close enough to the axis of the filter not reorientate like they do when bouncing off a surface? Why 50%? If it was one specific orientation, shouldn't it be a lot less than 50%? So it's probably reorienting those waves within 25% of the filter orientation rather than blocking out ones without the exact orientation needed. /v A thorium liquid fuel reactor video, decay cycle, and options video would be awesome for this channel in my opinion /v You should do another version without the loud, distracting music. How the hell am I supposed to concentrate on you talking so quickly about something so complicated with that annoying distraction? Why does everybody ruin their videos with annoying, loud music. /v I like Minute Physics, I have a beard, and I wear glasses!  /v God either doesn't exist or is insane, I'm going with the former /v maybe systox25 is correct... but it doesnt seem fun that way. so hear me out. maybe, it is not as locally real as it seems, and if the signal between photons must be faster than light while entangled then would the hidden variable be a portion of time itself?  if we entangled them to ground them to move at the same time and space, then what if its through different space-time altogether. here me out... they behave in the exact way we already know they do, and its not the photons themselves moving through this alternate space-time but the signal between photons themselves for a brief (and i mean faster than light brief) amount of time that causes them to behave this way. And the underlying variable isnt presently real but was or will be, real. (also. should have put this in earlier but im tired of revisions... the only reason they are able to move in such a way would be because it is light itself. and only isnt detectable because it blends in with other electromagnetic fields and waves in the surrounding areas, such as the sun, for example... just something i pulled out my ass but yeah.) /v The problem here is that it's treating all photons as equal (or the same) and they've all ready proved that they're not . /v This shit isn't nearly as complicated as you're making it.  When you pass a photon through a slit smaller than the sinusoidal height it rotates the polarization of the photon.  Imagine throwing a Frisbee between two poles, it either is at the proper angle to make it and get a kick in the direction of alignment at the same time, or it doesn't and bounces off.  Now picture this in a 9-d space where each of our 3 dimensions has another 2 complex dimensions bound to it - it just bounces out of reality and the vibration it leaves behind on the pole is the energy absorbed.  You don't need to lose realism or locality - you're just looking at the problem through a straw.  (Another hint: complex space is what you get when you have something moving faster than the speed of light - the photons just get kicked back in time.) /v Locality is most certainly obeyed, we know that it must in order for causality to not be violated.  Classical Realism is wrong though, in the sense that the 'hidden variables' which people were looking for and which are excluded by these experiments only eliminate CLASSICAL hidden information.  In reality the Shannon entropy is NEGATIVE and it is the interaction of the photons and the filters negative entropy which produce positive joint entropy values.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc /v What if the hidden variable is actually the angle of vibration of the light, and its interactions with filters is informed by that variable, and can also change this variable? Then, even in the entangled case, all our results make sense. Since the filter interaction operates on a cosine relationship, we would get exactly what we expect. The questions then are related to the difference in angle between two filters. The idea that the photon's state is multiple booleans relating to which filter it will pass through seems ill-posed, what is more important is the photon's angle. To make the entangled experiment more interesting, we should entangle three photons together, and pass them through all three filters simultaneously. Then our results would be interesting- if we see 72% of photons pass through all three, then we know there must be a faster than light communication between the photons. /v You know, I'm so tired of the XXI mania of jumping to conclusions that anything you don't fully understand is either breaking the laws of physics or is in 2 controversial states at once. Whatever the answer is, it's logical and clear. Learn to say I don't know. It's not as shameful as stating something stupid with a smart face. \n\nThen again, what else do I expect from YouTube... /v Um... this might be a dumb question - but would spin properties be translated *between* photons if they pass through a filter as a wave? instead of as a particle? /v the genius who built our computerized world didn't forsee us doing this experiment so thus a glitch in the system. probably will be patched soon. /v Whooooooooooooooa, that looks great, must be used in today's new tools. /v I think the only way us humans will understand quantum mechanics in any sort of meaningful way that makes sense to our minuscule minds, would be if advanced extraterrestrials visited us and taught us what they know about it. Because this shit just gets weirder and weirder the more we study it. And I think we are trying to mold it into something that our minds can actually perceive, and not how quantum mechanics truly works in its natural state. /v Isn't it more likely that two linear polarizing filters 45 degrees apart form a quarter wave plate and create elliptical or circular polarized light? Circular polarized light would have a presence in both of the linear polarized planes and allow light to pass through the linear polarizing filter. Fun fact if you rotate the last (3rd) filter -45 degrees instead of +45 degrees (with respect to the middle filter) it blocks the light in the center. This create another quarter wave plate that reversing the rotation convention of the circular polarization from right to left blocking all the photons. /v Wait a second. I think this video might be longer than a minute /v OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG THIS MINUTE WAS JEEEEEZZZ. LOL awesome vid guys..I had played with polarizing filters before, but didn't know just how cool the mathematics of it was. /v Can you PLEASE do this regularly I love this cooperative style because it shows how the process of discovery works in the scientific community with back and forth and slow introductory of new schools of thought and after watching this other videos while still entertaining and informative seem more lecture-ish. /v And it's not like we're absorbing the nonaligned portions of the photons polarization energy at each filter with individual photons.  That would create a red shift.  So I guess it's the total energy of the light wave (assuming I'm using this word right) is getting normalized to the polarization of each filter as it passes with the remaining energy absorbed by the filter.  Which I guess would mean that the filters are effectively destroying all the photons and recreating new photons that just happen to have the same statistical mix of wavelength and direction of travel, but with the new polarization mix.  Trying to make this work with classical physics is fun. /v The percentage of photons that make it through a lens of set of lenses is the same every time. Doesn't that suggest order and determinism? And doesn't that go against quantum theory which seems to be about chaotic things like cats that are neither alive or dead? /v This video was so illuminating and led me to ask Is there a Plank angle? and OF COURSE there is! Thank you! /v Maybe its just reflecting photons and not blocking them, so it bounces off b and hits A again, same with C... Also it seems linear in some format, we should try every round digit degree and find a spectrum to see if it actually is linear...\nor maybe its due to the structure of the filter.... Hmmm /v Loving these comments thinking they immediately understand a phenomenon that's been unfathomable for over 50 years... /v 3Blue1Brown is crap; never collaborate with him again!!! /v It's just turtles all the way down... /v I'm by no means a physics academic, but it seems to me that the differences in the make of the polarizing lenses weren't taken into consideration, looking at articles such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizing_filter_(photography) or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizer\n\nOr, perhaps a wrong example was used which doesn't really translate to the quantum mechanics being discussed. /v shouldve broken this up into a few videos. wouldve allowed for digestion of some hard to grasp subject matter before throwing in something on top of it /v The best way I can wrap my head around it is that the light is sort of ignoring the first polarizer in a 3 polarizer system and continuing as if its always at 45 degrees. /v Your hidden variable is consciousness. But it gets weirder. It's your consciousness that affects the experiment with the influence of your conscious mind and expectation. That it's the conscious influence of the individual particals that you didn't know were living, conscious, and with a choice. /v I like how many of the top comments are pointing out the effect that you guys shot down with the entangled photon experiment. Like, did everyone not finish the video? /v How does this account for human perception of light intensity?\nThis is probably a stupid question to you, but it's perplexing me /v This only disproves local hidden variables but not external ones, i.e(everything being controlled by a futuristic computer program like the matrix) /v I have seen the lens effect, but didn't give it much thought, I thought everyone kinda knew that that happened /v And this is why I'm not a physicist... /v Maybe we are wrong about photons being blocked. Maybe they realign to pass through a filter therefore taking their potential energy and light with them aligning and realigning as required to pass through filters? So therefore all photons pass through all filters by the realignment affects how we count them. After the first filter half the photos realigned and were aligned with and masked by the other 50% and so one. Once we accept that no photons are every blocked, but in effect masked by those they travel with the math starts to make sense. Where's my chalk board when I need it? /v If I hear one more blocked by A or pass through B I'm gonna destroy something. /v *1+1=3* /v Well, maths are wrong? /v mind = blown /v Minutephysics... 12 minute video... /v For cinematographers, cheap Variable ND Filter! Yay! /v Frankly realism sounds more basic than locality. /v Absolutely fascinating, thank you guys /v 17 minutephysics. /v MELHOR\nVDEO\nEVER ! /v 17 minute physics /v They became vsauce. /v Well |Done> /v yay 3blue1brown /v Weird shit /v I feel sooooo lost /v multipleminutephysics /v Some sort of quantum combing effect? /v I'm putting on me underwears and a tuxedo and bringing a football to watch this movie. /v        !!! /v Song - Ace Marino , Communication /v Ahaha what a story. /v The Room two yeessssss /v Reminds me of Criss Angel here. /v Song: Ace Marino - Communication /v What song /v Eh. /v I just nutted /v haha you must be kidding arent you /v So troll /v Amazing /v  /v *oh hi mark* /v Oh Hi Mark /v You maust be keeding.

Shame /v who agrees that angelica is better than celine /v To much screaming /v I can't believe this is better than Celine Tam's  /v She should sing fireworks by Katy Perry for the finals! The song suits her voice... /v Celine Tam is like a pastry chef, everything must be precise and well-calculated for the end product to be perfect while Angelica Hale on the other hand is like a culinary chef, she puts a lot of spices and herbs together and mix it with other ingredient, it might not be perfect but the end product is remarkable and very tasty. /v That was her worst performance imo /v Light balance is better... She's just another signer /v She is good, but sometimes kids with this kind of talent won't keep it as they get older, unfortunately. This is why I didn't really want her to go on.. /v Gorgeous voice as always...but for the finale, I am truly rooting for her to choose something fun and upbeat. We already know she can crush the soulful ballads, but I absolutely adored Girl on Fire and would love to see her sing something like that again--something to really get the audience fired up. I Want to Dance with Somebody would be exciting! /v don't get me wrong she's really good...... but i like darci more........ /v Celine deserves to be in the finals /v Some Pinoys here, mahilig makisakay sa popularity ng iba! That is why Americans are raging about this Filips na nakiki-claim lang! Angelica is 100% American, she was born and was raised in Atlanta, Georgia. This kid wants to give back, America saved her life in near death she had  a kidney transplant. She does not even know Phils is. She is genetically part Filipina, but her father cleared already that the mother has Zero talent in Singing. Pinoys must remember that americans or people in America are the voters, not Pinoys or You tubers outside America. /v Damn he really looks like he lost wait good for u boogy! /v Where'd boogie go?

Your changes are big, impressive, and so so satisfying. Keep it up, were all rooting and proud. /v Holy shit boogie you're looking slimmer and slimmer every video. I have to examine you every time a new upload comes out because it seems like you're shrinking and I need to double-take to make sure I'm not just seeing things.

Your spirits seem high , so proud of ya. My wife went through this 3 years ago and it's a great thing. Pretty much everything you've been saying is exactly what she experienced. She's not on YouTube much but I showed her a few of your vids and I can tell ya, she loves Francis  \n\nMost people don't realize it but it's a journey for the significant other as well when someone goes through this. It's all about the support between each other and I can tell your wife has your back big time. \n\nKeep us updated , love the videos as usual  !! /v Watching from Houston.

Also, bring back Francis. But AFTER you recover, m'kay? /v OMFG I SEE THE DIFFERENCE /v Boogie is looking way slimmer!! Keep it up boogie /v If I see one more hippie saying go vegan. Wait I can say it YouTube might flag it, cuz it will hurt their feelings. /v Nothing but love and happy vibes to you, very happy for you! :) /v You keep at it man! Stay positive, be you, keep living! Most of all though, keep making videos!  /v Boogie, you may not physically be slim yet, but you are mentally slim already.\n\nBeards are for large people. A clean shaven large man usually looks more childish, so the beard helps man up their face.\n\nIf you shave the beard, you will look 10 years younger, and you will enjoy watching your face slim. /v THIS IS NOT BOOGIE!!!! FREE THE REAL ONE \nNah keep chill dud /v The eating situation would make a great Francis vid, just ranting about food amounts and drinking water /v I haven't watched a boogie vid in forever, you look great dude!!!! /v He has really thinned out good job man /v Can I buy you a home gym? /v i'm happy that things are getting brighter for you boogie :) /v Boogie are you planning on make a Destiny 2 review? /v When u become 298lbs will u change ur name to boogie298? /v Great stuff boogie , welcome to a new life :) /v Looking good buddy. Proud of you setting And reaching those goals you've set for yourself. I'm a firm believer in having a major goal. But the only way to reach it is to set many smaller goals to get you there. It makes the trip much more enjoyable. /v Fuck yeah boogie! You can do it!! /v Thank you for not getting dead. /v I can definitely tell the difference since your surgery, both in your face and in the width of your shoulders. It's great to see you smiling! Congratulations, and thank you for keeping us all posted! /v Boogie. You have my full support through this process. Glad to see you are doing good. Hope I didn't miss any videos because of the hurricane here in Florida. Keep doing what you do. /v That's fucking amazing, stay hydrated and keep up the progress!! /v Does your beard look bigger because your face is smaller??? XD LOVE YA BRO!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !  HELL NO !!! /v I wont donate to anthing Clinton  and Bushes are involved in.

When we aren't busy ruining the very fabric of your family by corrupting your kids with immoral values and depravity, we like to all hold hands and take one day out of the year to give back ;) /v Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues. /v don't donate to them because most of the money goes to making this video ads etc. /v Those celebrities were all paid to answer the phones on tv.... from donations. And many were seen joking around. The rich don't care. Ever seen a celebrity actually volunteer .... by doing manual labor for more than a few minutes?? /v GLOBAL WARNING IS A FRAUD....!!!!!!!    BUT YOU ARE SO NAIVE YOU    BE LIE VE      THEIR LIES....!!! /v this event is filled with so many secret transgenders, it's a hoot /v The Globe is warming soooooo fast, that our Antarctic ice caps are refreezing at the most rapid pace in recent history! I never knew how such hot temperatures could freeze water so fast! /v CAME HERE FOR TORI\nI LOVE U TORI\n\nBTW ISN'T IT IRONIC THE RICHEST CELEBRITIES ARE BEGGING FOR PEOPLE TO DONATE? DON'T THINK THEY DONATED A FRACTION OF WHAT THEY HAVE /v Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites. This is the only message could save you, otherwise you are only going to suffer before our Land Lord Creator evict you from His temporary dwelling. /v I like how they talked about Aric playing piano but the video of him playing was muted /v why cant all these celebs donate among themselves instead of asking us for dough. Its a joke.... when will the sheeple wake the f___ up.... /v This would be a beautiful thing if the money actually went to the people who need it. Yes the real America helped each other and showed their compassion, but all of you celebrities are doing nothing more than what you get paid to do, and that is act. /v JJ watt collected 31 million real dollars compared to your 14 million fake pledge dollars and he was at ground zero passing out food and water Hollywood calling the working man a racist and a nazi than begs him for money so hmmmm give u greedy fucktards money or jj watt i went with jj i encourage the rest of hard working Americans to do the same /v One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain.....\n-----Robert Nesta Marley /v These intense storms were NOT due to Global Warming.\n\n*** They were due to Solar Flares from our Sun. Perfectly normal and healthy. ***\n\nPlease attribute things properly with accurate education \n\nI am profoundly grateful to see so many came together and raise 44+ million. <3 <3 <3 /v These celebrities don't disappoint, do they? They really know how to make it about them. I've already donated to legitimate relief funds that didn't wait for a televised spot on all 4 major networks. /v Four feet of water in my home in Meyerland. These bastards can go to hell! We as Houstonians did just fine without their look at me act like an ass benefit. /v Oh wow so much hate in the comments. No wonder America is going to the dogs. I do pray for the victims of Irma and Harvey and I appreciate the work the heroes, celebs and communities are doing to help them. For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could. So get over the hate, hold someone's hand and help how you can. If you can't do that well God help you. /v A disturbing number of people (kids?) commenting here seem to have a massive hard on for these elitist celebrities and have no problem elevating them to near god-like status. I guess should expect as much from your run-of-the-mill MTV audience. I hope that one day many of you will wake up and come to the realization that the elites don't give a shit about you. /v They couldve gave themselves as well this is crazy /v 14:29 too much surgery lool /v JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE  /v Selena Gomez  /v Selena and Ariana?!! /v Why\nD0nt\nYou\nDonate, stars /v Jared Leto  /v Subscribe To my YouTube channnel \nMusic videos and fun content /v Very low views because a sermon from the left bashing the Right /v This fund raiser would not have happened if The Donald had not out up a mil. this is not an honest fund raiser its a feel good leftie back rub for their own strike at Trump /v 19:54  /v Stealing money! /v ...IN JESUS NAME, I/WE PRAY, AMEN. /v 48:22 who is he?! /v Hahahaha I don't know which is funnier:\n*The fact that these wealthy celebrities are asking the broke public to donate, the fact that these donations are going to be pocketed or the fact that they're all acting like they're answering calls...* /v I like that they used unlikely duos. /v Hey MTV, why not show the full clip of Stevie Wonder in the beginning?  Not only his out of place, badly timed ad hominum toward those who might donate, but his insensitive Xian prayer that he sneaked into his speech. /v Justin is the cutest /v More left-wing propagandists making money off of a disaster.  I have to wonder what percentage will ever make it to the people who need it.  Good Lord, these hateful, left-wing hypocrites make me want to puke.  So full of themselves. /v These damn celebrities good give a rat's ass about the common people! They live in their own fantasy world with selfies! Bunch of hypocritical morons that are out of touch with the common people!! /v Money  raised by a bunch of liberals, only a fraction of the money will go for helping those in need, the rest will go in their pockets, Please give to another organization, these folks already have to much money, /v Dont there just going to take them money and run like the rich always do I am taking them a truck load of fresh water next week help how you can /v Selena literally didnt shed one tear /v u guyz suck. /v Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks  https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553 /v Who came here for Dave Matthews? /v well done to them but can i just say the james bond guy is british so is some of the money going to the british vigin islands? /v 29:06 DAVE Matthews!!! /v
