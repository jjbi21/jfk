 I think that most of the trailer is taken from the first half of the film because of Rey in her same clothes and hair from the end of TFA and not the new style from TLJ and also Kylo I I think you're a great person with a great channel, but by not giving the identity of the perpetrator's name, you make ppl only more curious. They are less likely to search him up if his identity is revealed. R.I.P sweet ANGEL.... ¬

 DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It's written and directed by Woody Allen an alleged molester who married his stepdaughter. He is disgusting and I strongly advise you refrain from giving him money. The fact Amazon is parading around his name Too bad Beck has continued his decent into children's music. His next song will feature Elmo, Barney, and the Teletubies. ¬

 It was horrible. Think the part in Requim for a Dream where the tv breaks open and there is loud music, lights everywhere, what the hell is going on type for an hour. No film critic wants to give it So that is Sadie Robertson right? ¬
 So it's ok for them to call each other the N word ,but if s white person says it, they are racist, double standard wirld we live, and fans can express their views and be vocal, get used to it, Life saving watch you say? Bet you wouldn't do this with a Breitling Emergency II ¬
 The Book of Life didn't live up to my expectations, the animation style wasn't my favorite and there were some scenes that didn't sit well with me.

 I have been telling people for years that racism in the Gay white community is worse than in the general population.

 For anybody to cover a Bowie song and do it justice, really takes some doing. This proves how good they are..... Daves voice as good as ever, but for me Martin Gores guitar is what stands out the most. On 5:02 it's uncle pug from alexwassabi ¬

 Good riddance. This PREDATOR started the visual publication of pornography, which in-turn created other competitive brands (hustler, penthouse, club, etc) and so forth. The publication and availability of this illicit material caused infidelity, hedonism, debauchery, etc. Some I love how she was asking if the host's dad is ok after the cancer.

 Hi Just gotta add a correction. Fifth Generation Inc. (i.e. Titos) is not the first ever legal distillery in Texas. Although they hold the DSP-TX-S-1 there is evidence of multiple distilleries being open during the Confederacy and also during the Well, at least we see the bucket works. ¬

 Liberals still can't believe anything but the sounds of their own never ending tantrums. Collbert is paid to be a liberal monkey and would say anything the writers wrote.

 Batteries aren't benign. Nothing really is .... even photovoltaics. The chemicals needed to make these things are a bit nasty.

And also just like in Central Intelligence Kevin gets hit by Dwayne.... ¬

 I guess this is the best analysis as to why we get hooked to Black Mirror in a way that is not even close to the others. After every episode, we can't really figure out what emotion we feel Do you think the start stop at 6:15 into the video is to do with the size of the mirror fragment?\nAs if the laser comes off the mirror no reflection on the wall.\n\nBrilliant vid, I must try this... Thank you w ¬

 He's lying about being a jew if he's able to do that. Also, it's common practice for white supremacists to gas-light their prey or audience by loving the thing they advocate exterminating. Nearly 100% of the Nazis in Charlotesville Loved this! Beautifully done! ¬

 All the old timers talk about inflation this, inflation that: back in my day a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread cost me 5 cents So why did this bearer bond/perpetual bond never rise according to inflation? David are you an Apple or Samsung fan ¬

 Does anyone care if an atheist is offended by religious symbols and the war and death it brings? Are we removing religious statues, symbols and churches so it doesn't offend the atheist? I never seen any atheist or even Satanic #Goals ¬
 Um... is that really the plot of this movie? ¬
 how YouTube videos tell us what we already know but try to do it in a way where it sounds exciting and as if it was something we didn't know. ¬
 I feel like the main purpose of the visuals in this video was to display how fresh KB's dreads are. Justified! ¬
 Wow that is so sad ¬

 I have double jointed elbows too! ¬
 It's a great idea to add North Korea to the ban list. Idiots travel there, giving money to a shocking regime and risk getting detained for some false charge. ¬

Won't really help, but sure, if it GOOGLE DAN SCHNEIDER. Same exact thing has Weinstein but with the children of Nickelodeon!\n\nWe have worked for years to expose Harvey Weinstein, Dan Schneider (of Nickelodeon) and countless other degenerative executives running Hollywood.\n\nGroups working together in Pizzagate have been ignored Wow! This one is my favorite so far. Loved seeing those hands showcased too ¬

 Jews aren't effected by the patriarchy they are the patriarchy. They being such a small minority have such immense power and wealth. Jews run Hollywood and it's bad ways. 2% of the population owns 35% of the wealth. ¬

 Its all fun and games until it happens to you. Sandy hook masacre become a joke for Republican hard core gun lovers. Now white TrumpTurds get hit ? Not cool. Is it ??????? ¬
 Mayim, I think it's unfair to say that men are solely motivated by sex. The female equivalent would be to say that women are solely motivated by wealth and security. And that simply isn't true. Our human minds are nuanced Looks weird, but also unique and pretty beautiful. Would love to see how this fares in theaters. ¬

 The largest mass murder in US history is The Mountain Meadows Massacre , a Mormon job. 140 dead, 17 children kidnapped. By Mormons.

 This was the greatest 73 questions with the most amazing guest so far. It was hilarious, fun, cute and NATURAL. These other guests act like they memorized their answers like a script. Ugh everything Tracy does is amazing ¬

I'll always appreciate how Jeremy actually has 55,000 views equals trending because sports. ¬

 I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again.

They are also fucking Congrats trending! ¬

 I like the idea of Tarzan and the Frozen sister's being siblings, but the times don't make sense. Frozen/Tangled take place in the 1840s, where as Tarzan takes place in the 1910s.

 As a person who doesn't suffer from OCD, but do have other mental health problems (Aspergers and anxiety), I was really blowned away about how real and authentic it was written. I've read YA books specifically about asperger's and specifically Gimmi a break. Ive watched that dude fight a dozen times and its like watching a fight video game. 10,000 punches thrown yet none of them do any damage. he really is the least exciting fighter to watch and calling danced nicely around any derogatory comments about trump in order not to enter negotiations without negative aspect. Far more intelligent in international affairs than all the comment makers. You really have to listen to what is not said 48 on trending wtf ¬

I've definitely thought of it, I asked this question like 15 years ago when I did my first taxes. Why is the US so ass backwards. ¬
 Congratulations Amber!! I love your videos so freaking much, you're such a positive ray of awesomeness and you deserve all the happiness in the world Congrats again! ¬

 dump her like spicer. shes a fucking cunt ¬
 Absolutely loved it! ¬
 I don't know why everyone is hating on this. Like sorry it's not Captain America or some other shit, but I thought it looked decently funny. I don't see it being huge but I think it'd be enjoyable. It's a SNL got it right. A second term with Trump really is the scariest thing I can think of ¬
 i'm getting high on this song ¬
 Smiled ¬
 Great review ¬
 Nice. But don't out passengers and transformers in the trailers. You gonna make it seems like it's gonna suck. ¬

 What I know is that apple sells shit to customers at a premium $1300 price tag. That watch shouldn't cost that much. It's what Trump does with his name. He knows his name is worth more than what he sells. Was anyone else shocked when they kissed in the car lol ¬

 Ebro will beat 50 in a fight, 50 only makes records about being gangster but that's as far as his gangster image goes, that's why 50 is a fan of ctg because they both run when they're confronted on the the fact that I'm older than him ¬

 Pennywise's friendliness is basically like a shield. It only works once, before your cover's blown. ¬
 Is this the official music video? A fitting tribute, I could imagine the spirit of Cohen walking through his memories after death while watching this, he left the table, he's out of the game, but the music is still playing MY QUEEN RACHEL ¬

 Weird combination of the video, posting it on a Florida college channel from Italian servers/organization using some information from a laser beam in the tri-cities in Washington state. \nI suppose in an age of division, at least we know science best ¬
 I enjoyed Your Name but man....that movie twist shit doesn't make any sense at all. That's why I don't loved the movie like everybody else. Yeah, the animation is masterpiece but the story though, you can't fool me. ¬

 Good, this was actually funny! I was so sad Nick was going to ruin himself for me in this. ¬
 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. Lets get to the real point here. His hair. ¬

 Fun fact: My Mom scared the crap out of a Knotts Berry worker innocently sitting in the dark monitoring the ride. When we found ourselves on a slow-paced, relatively dull ride, we'd entertain ourselves by pointing out bits of scenery This looks like something that would be better as a miniseries. Just by the sheer scale of the production and everything they tried to pack into the trailer, I'm afraid the final product won't be able to pull together all You got one of the best colour combinations...Looks dope!\nMy favorite is the red 720s though ¬
 The floor scenes were my favorite part, I dont know I just thought it was creatively different ¬
 Cynicism and sarcasm should not be mixed with information. And if you want to truly convey objective information then you should at least try to show both sides rather than just say, well we don't say having kids is bad Snl has changed... wtf is this shit man. Gay television!!?!???!? ¬

 Jared says weird shit sometimes just to fuck with people, especially with reporters. He mentioned used condoms himself, obviously joking, but it backfired spectacularly on him.

 Why do liberals always have to make things about identity politics? ¬
 Jlin operates at such a high level its lost on most people. Honestly. 80 / 20 rule. 80% don't even see what he's trying to achieve. 20% do. KMART is just trying to save face. ¬

 As a chiefs fan and someone who attends the games at arrowhead stadium often I can honestly say I have never heard a racial slur at the stadium. For the most part Arrowhead is a very fun and safe place It is a fun thought experiment based on the idea that technology advances could/may create the possibility of simulated consciousness aka AI, but what makes all of this bogus, for me personally, is the idea that there is no real IT SMELLS LIKE FRICKEN APPLES\nTHEY SMELL dELICIOUS, THEYRE SO POTENT ¬

 It doesn't seem such a difficult question to me. Given the correct environment our brain should be able to exit with consciousness intact.
